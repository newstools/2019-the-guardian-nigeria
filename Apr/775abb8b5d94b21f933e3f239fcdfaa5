BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) on Thursday, announced that it’s shutting down its service by May 31st. “Today we’re announcing that we will be closing BBM consumer service on 31 May 2019. Thank you for being part of the BBM consumer service experience!” the platform wrote on Twitter. In a post shared on its website, BBM explained the reason for the action: “Three years ago, we set out to reinvigorate BBM consumer service, one of the most loved instant messaging applications, as a cross-platform service where users can not only chat and share life experiences, but also consume content and use payment services. We poured our hearts into making this a reality, and we are proud of what we have built to date. The technology industry however, is very fluid, and in spite of our substantial efforts, users have moved on to other platforms, while new users proved difficult to sign on. Though we are sad to say goodbye, the time has come to sunset the BBM consumer service, and for us to move on. We are grateful for your support and wish to thank everyone, especially our users, partners, and employees, for being part of the BBM consumer service journey. We hope you will cherish many fond memories of BBM consumer service that helped shape messenger platforms to become what they are today.”
