Beyonce gave fans quite the homecoming when she dropped quite the surprise on her fans by releasing an album titled, “Homecoming: The Live Album” to go with an upcoming Netflix documentary on her performance at Coachella last year. “Homecoming: The Live Album” features 40 live cuts and as expected, fans went into a frenzy as it was more than the Bey Hive could have wished for.  The album is a counterpart to the 2-hours-plus film, which takes a deep dive into Beyonce’s landmark headline performance at 2018 Coachella performance and features candid footage and interviews. The album just like the film was released in the early hours of today across all major streaming platforms, including Apple Music, Spotify and Google Play. Beyonce’s 2018 Coachella headlining gig made her the first black woman to headline the festival. She ensured that she paid tribute to musical heritage by using her set to honour historically black. This surprise album isn’t the first time Beyonce is pulling the tactic as her album, “Lemonade” and the joint album with her husband, Jay Z titled, “Everything Is Love” were also released without any prior announcement.
