Last year, August Alsina was a guest on Jada Pinkett Smith’s highly-popular Red Table Talk show, speaking about his struggles with drug addiction and opening up to the world and Jada spoke about her own battles with sex addiction on the same episode. Jada Pinkett and August Alsina grew incredibly close after sharing such deep parts of their past lives together. Alsina spoke on his relationship with the Smith family and he was definitely embraced by them but judging from some of the lyrics in his new cover of Kehlani’s “Nunya,” some people think that he and Jada had a little more than just a regular friendship. August Alsina and Jada Pinkett In the video for August Alsina’s cover ‘Nunya’, the New Orleans singer is having a text conversation with a woman named ‘Koren’, which fans have pointed out is Jada Pinkett Smith’s middle name. In the song, August wants more from his girlfriend, giving her time to make him a priority. At a point in the video, he sings the line “You’re just an actress putting on a show,” and a GIF of Jada Pinkett appears on the screen
After the two references to Jada, a lot of fans are convinced that this song is exposing his affair with her while others believe it’s just a publicity stunt to promote the song and revive Alsina’s career. watch the video for “Nunya” via YouTube below; https://youtu.be/vjRz7kD0b0U
