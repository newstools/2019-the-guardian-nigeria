Kwara State Governor, Abdulfatah Ahmed has said the Kwara State University (KWASU)’s Governing Council reserves the right to recruit a new Vice Chancellor (VC) as the incumbent’s tenure expires. In a statement issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Communications, Muyideen Akorede, the governor said reports on social media that he was attempting to influence the selection process of a new VC for KWASU in favour of particular candidate was not true. While dismissing a post on social media as an attempt to blackmail him, Ahmed also dissociated his office and his aides from any attempt to foist anyone on the university as Vice Chancellor.He said the Ministry of Tertiary Education, Science and Technology, KWASU’s supervisory ministry had briefed him and that the university was yet to receive any response on its recent advertisement for a new VC, not to talk of influencing the selection process in favour of any candidate. He stressed that the recruitment of a chief executive for KWASU, would follow guidelines enshrined in the law establishing the institution, which mandates the governing council to supervise the process and forward names of shortlisted candidates to the governor for approval. While urging members of the public to disregard the misinformation on the state-owned tertiary institution, Ahmed restated his administration’s commitment to due process and respect for lawful institutions, even as it prepares to leave office.
