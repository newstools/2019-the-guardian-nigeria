Carly Rae Jepsen, in January, released the 80s-pop reminiscent tune titled “No Drug Like Me.” Now, the Canadian songstress has re-enacted an ad to promote her tune. In the late ’90s, Partnership for a Drug-Free America (now known as the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids) aired a commercial in which actress Rachael Leigh Cook used a pan and an egg as a metaphor for a brain on drugs. “This is your brain,” she said holding up the egg, “And this is heroin,” she said holding up the pan. “This is what happens to your brain after snorting heroin,” Cook explains before slamming the pan down on the egg, and then uses it to smash apart the the kitchen to represent what happens to “your family, friends, your money, your job, your self respect, your future and your life.” The Call Me Maybe crooner went on to recreate the commercial exactly as its original; instead, she uses her song “No Drug Like Me” in place of heroin in the metaphor. …and now a public service announcement. #nodruglikeme  https://t.co/k0g8xAfp10 pic.twitter.com/jAhMEWJpN5 — Carly Rae Jepsen (@carlyraejepsen) April 12, 2019  Her upcoming album, Dedicated, drops May 17 ahead of her North American tour.
