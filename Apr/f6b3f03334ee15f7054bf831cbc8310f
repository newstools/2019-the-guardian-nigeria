Brothers and sisters all over the world celebrated National Siblings Day on Wednesday. Celebrities also paid tribute to their siblings in celebration of the day and shared precious photos with their fans on social media. The Jonas Brothers shared a throwback photo of the four bros (including “bonus Jonas” Frankie, in addition to the group’s Joe, Nick and Kevin), while Broadway legend Lin-Manuel Miranda posted a photo of his sister, revealing that the two got matching tattoos last year. Other celebrities, including Tegan and Sara, Mark Wahlberg, Jared Leto, Chris Pratt, Ellen DeGeneres, Michelle Obama and Chris Evans, also shared sweet tributes to their siblings. For as long as I can remember, my big brother Craig has always had my back. He's still one of my best friends today.
