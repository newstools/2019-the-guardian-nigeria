Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai NUJ president warns against harassment of journalists
Governor Nasir el-Rufai’s adviser on Media and Publicity, Muyiwa Adekeye, yesterday ordered armed security operatives to chase away the editor of New Impression magazine from St. Gerald Catholic Hospital in Kaduna State. The governor was in the hospital to see victims of the Kasuwa Magani attack by armed bandits, which left about 40 people dead and many others displaced. The journalist, Mordecai Ibrahim, was at the hospital, unknown to Kaduna government officials led by el-Rufai, to cover the governor’s visit when Adekeye sighted him and ordered the governor’s security details to walk him out of the hospital premises. Ibrahim explained: “It is indeed absurd and unfortunate that Muyiwa Adekeye, a supposedly experienced journalist, should have behaved in such a ridiculous manner. The Publisher/Editor-in-Chief of New Impression magazine, who was at St. Gerald Catholic Hospital, Kaduna, to see victims of the recent Kasuwa Magani attacks, explained how the governor’s aide identified him and ordered security men to chase him out. In order not to be labelled a security threat, the journalist reportedly left the scene. Meanwhile, the president of Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Chris Isiguzo, has warned against attacks, intimidation and harassment of journalists in the country. Isiguzo gave the warning in Bauchi yesterday when he visited the state for the one year remembrance service of the mother of the union’s national secretary, Shuaibu Leman. He said: “Quite recently, a journalist was picked up. He was on detention for two years. The second time he was picked up, I vowed that we will not allow anyone mess any of you up again under our watch. “ To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
