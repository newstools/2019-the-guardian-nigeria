 [FILES] Thomas Dennerby. PHOTO: GETTYIMAGES  Perhaps sure of positively tackling hosts France, Korea and Norway in their Group A to advance to the round of 16, Dennerby says he is prepared to surpass the Super Falcons’ previous quarterfinals performance. But he dismissed suggestions that he should resign if his team failed to meet his target. “Should I fail to surpass the Super Falcons’ previous quarterfinals performance, the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) is at liberty to take decision,” he said. The Swede was quick to point out that he was not under any pressure going to the France FIFA Women World Cup, saying, “I know how to handle my feelings. I’m old enough as not to put myself under any pressure.” The Super Falcons’ first outing in group A would be on Saturday, June 8 against Norway. They will tackle Korea four days later before locking horns with hosts France in the group’s final encounter on June 17.The Swede says he is capable of providing solutions to the entire group A teams, pointing out that the domestic players currently in his camp are doing well. Dennerby says he needs about 15 foreign-based professionals in the team to join the seven he will select from the domestic league to make up the required number before sending the list to FIFA in mid April.Among the home-based players currently in camp is Alice Ogebe, who has vowed to give her all to be in the final squad.
