Drake’s Scorpion album released in 2018 grabbed the title of the most popular album of the year, according to Nielsen Music. And the rapper’s not done yet as he is eyeing a ninth No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. The “hotline bling” crooner told the crowd at his London stop of the Assassination Vacation tour on Tuesday night (April 9) that he has already begun working on his new record less than a year after Scorpion‘s delivery. “I kinda actually started night last night to be honest with you,” he’s heard saying in a video uploaded to Twitter by a fan. “But I think what I’ma do after this is go home, and I’ma make a new album so I can come back to London next year and we can do this again.” See below:
