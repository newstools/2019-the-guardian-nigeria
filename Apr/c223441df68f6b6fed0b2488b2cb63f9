REUTERS/Akintunde Akinleye (NIGERIA – Tags: POLITICS) Imo State Governor, Rochas Okorocha, has said that he has the constitutional power to make appointments until he leaves office on May 29, this year. He stated this shortly in Owerri, yesterday, after inaugurating the chairman and members of some government boards and parastatals less than two months to the end of his tenure. Okorocha, who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Mark Uchendu, charged the inaugurated members to discharge their duties diligently for the good of the state, assuring that the law backed their appointment even as they were entitled to all benefits accruing to their respective offices. “My government is alive till May 29. So, I still have the rights as empowered by the constitution to make appointments till then. I want to assure you that this (the appointment) is backed by law. You will stay in office even after my stay till the end of your tenure and you are entitled to all benefits of your respective positions,” he said. The inauguration of the boards is coming amid criticisms by the opposition that Okorocha was plotting to impose a heavy burden on the incoming governor, Emeka Ihedioha. It could be recalled that last Friday, Okorocha had also appointed members of the State Judicial Service Commission (JSC). Meanwhile, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state, Jasper Ndubuaku, has advised the governor-elect to probe the outgoing government in the state if he assumes office.
