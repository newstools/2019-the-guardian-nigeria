They also used its flight control systems, heaping the blame largely on the manufacturer. “The March 10 crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 killed all 157 passengers and crew on the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet. “Data has shown significant similarities between the crash and the Lion Air disaster in October when the same model of plane crashed soon after take-off. “All Boeing Max jets have been grounded worldwide as the investigations continue. “Ethiopian officials say the pilots followed instructions provided by Boeing. “Ethiopian Airlines says the initial report clearly showed its pilots followed guidance provided by Boeing and approved by the FAA,’’ the report said.
