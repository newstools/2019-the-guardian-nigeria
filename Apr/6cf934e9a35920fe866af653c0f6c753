Olympian Michael Phelps and his wife, Nicole, recently made an important announcement — he’s going to be a dad again! The retired competitive swimmer — who, with a total of 28 medals (13 of them gold), is the most successful and decorated Olympian of all time — and his wife Nicole Johnson Phelps shared the good news on Instagram: “No. 3 on the way!” Michael, 33, captioned a photo of sons Boomer Phelps, 2, and Beckett Phelps, 13 months on his account — the two boys sitting in a car adorned with gold balloons spelling out the word “baby.” “Can’t wait to see the journey that this takes us on!!!” Michael added. “#luckyman.” Nicole, 33, shared the same image on her account. “Oops we did it again  I get to be a mama x3!!” she wrote, adding the hashtag, “#herewegoagain.”   #3 on the way!
