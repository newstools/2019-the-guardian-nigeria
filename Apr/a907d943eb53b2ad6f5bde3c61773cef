A doctor gets murdered and @LUTHARD100 want to be politically correct. That’s someone’s life o! Not Johnny. His name is Stephen. #JusticeforStephen — Tushified Pidgin  (@redd_moustache) April 5, 2019   Gbadebo Jimoh and Malik Adeboye have been arrested and here are their faces. They were paraded by police in association with the murder of Dr. Stephen. I wish they can release them to the 200L students as live cadavers. #JusticeForStephen pic.twitter.com/eSuUyDwq3l — Dr. B.I.B (@babatundebalo) April 5, 2019   Waking up to another young and vibrant soul being killed by hoodlums.
