 Atiku Abubakar  In a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party said: “The interview, which has already gone viral, speaks volumes about the reported INEC’s denial of the existence of such a server for the 2019 general elections. “It also exposed the frenzy on the part of President Muhammadu Buhari’s team to distract the Presidential election petitions tribunal by externalising its proceedings. “This is in addition to Presidency’s feverish attempt to divert public attention by engaging in judicial interpretations and hauling insults on our party and candidate, Atiku Abubakar, over our determination to retrieve our stolen mandate in court.” Ologbondiyan added that the lesson in the latest episode is in the reality that no matter how long falsehood appears to thrive, the truth will always come to light and prevail at last. He pointed out that instead of resorting to frenetic and chaotic playing to the gallery, the PDP advises President Buhari and his team to face justice at the tribunal. “The PDP advised President Buhari and his team to curb their desperation and respect the Court of Appeal by ending their externalisation of proceedings, which has been their scheme to distract the court and derail justice. “The PDP and Atiku respect the court and will never join President Buhari’s team to engage in actions that tend to undermine independence and sanctity of the judiciary. “Our party stands with Nigerians in our determination to retrieve our stolen mandate and no amount of shenanigans will distract us from the resolve of Nigerians in expectation of triumph of their will at the tribunal,” the statement added.
