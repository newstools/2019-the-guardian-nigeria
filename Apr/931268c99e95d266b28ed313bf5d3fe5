Golden Eaglets The Golden Eaglets of Nigeria yesterday played a 1-1 draw with Uganda in the ongoing 2019 Total U-17 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). With that result, the Eaglets topped group A with seven points. The U-17 national team, which showed promises, was wasteful in the match played at the Chamazi Stadium in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The players lost a lot of scoring chances created in the explosive encounter. Akinkunmi Amoo’s poor finish in the 17th minute from a wonderful team effort denied Nigeria an early goal. Another goal-bound effort from a free kick by Wisdom Ubani in the 20th minute went over the bar. Seconds later, Ugandan’s Samson Kasozi header almost opened scores for his country but his effort hit the upright. Goal attempts by Amoo, Ubani Fawaz Abdullahi were all wasted, as the Ugandan goalkeeper, Jack Komakech, survived the onslaughts from Nigeria. The Ugandans punished the Nigerian team with a 70th minute goal from a corner kick, which John Alou converted. Nigeria’s Sunday Stephen’s poor clearance, which landed in front of Alou, left him with an open net to slot in his country’s goal. Ibraheem Jabaar equalised in the 74th minute through a pass from Olakunle Olusegun, who calmly displaced the onrushing Ugandan goalkeeper. Nigeria’s next match will be a semifinal matchup on Wednesday with the runners up in Group B, while Angola, who defeated the hosts, Tanzania 4-2, will have a date with winners of group B. However, in today’s final group B games, Cameroon will meet Senegal while Guinea will clash with Morocco. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
