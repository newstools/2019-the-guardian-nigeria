The candidate of the Action Democratic Party (ADP) in the last governorship election in Lagos state Babatunde Gbadamosi has said he will not contest the outcome of the election at the tribunal. Gbadamosi said he will be devoting his time and resources towards preparation for the next election in 2023. The ADP candidate lost the election to the candidate of the ruling All Progressive Party (APC), Babajide Sanwo-Olu. “My decision is to wait and contest the next election and hopefully, the votes will count then. However, I do not have any more resources to waste on a process in which I have no confidence,” Gbadamosi said. Gbadamosi, who had consistently criticised the election results, said those involved electoral malpractices should be punished severely for their crimes. He appealed to the Nigerian Senate to come up with a law to punish electoral offenders. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
