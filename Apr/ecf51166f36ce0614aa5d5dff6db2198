Cardi B is not only making money moves this year as she is set to make Billboard history with a whooping 21 nominations. Cardi who released her debut album, Invasion of Privacy in 2018, has earned nominations in several categories including “Top Selling Artist” and “Top Rap Album”. She was nominated in eight categories but took home one (Rap Female Artist) last year. If this will play out again with all that has happened since then, we can only count down. Coming in close is Drake and Post Malone with 17 nominations. The late rapper, XXXTentaction is not left out of the box as he gets 10 nods. The event will hold at the MGM GM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on May 1 and will be hosted by Kelly Clarkson. Check out the full nomination list below: Top Artist: Top New Artist:
