 A girl feeling depressed from rape  Chukwuede, attached to the Lion Building Police Station is the Investigating Police Officer (IPO) in the case. She made the revelation while being led in evidence by Ms. A.R. Abolade during the trial of Popoola. The IPO said at about 8:50p.m. on May 29, 2016, the child’s father came to lodge a complaint of sexual assault against Popoola. “The complainant said he sent his seven-year-old daughter on an errand to get the balance of change from where he went to buy pure water. On her way, Popoola saw the girl, took her into a parked commercial tricycle and put his fingers into her vagina. “A man unknown to them saw them inside the ‘Keke NAPEP’ and approached the defendant and the child took them all to the church where her father was waiting for her. The man told her father he saw the girl and Ope in the parked Keke Marwa, he asked the girl what they were doing at that time of the day and she said Ope was putting his fingers in her private part,” Chukwuede said. The policewoman said while interrogating the child, she told her that when Popoola accosted her, he had asked her where she was going, when she told him, he told her that he wanted to buy something from her. “He then grabbed her, took her to the parked Keke Marwa and started using his fingers to touch her private part,” the IPO said. Chukwuede said that as part of her investigation, she went to the scene of the crime but the parked commercial tricycle was no longer there. “I also made efforts to contact the man who had flashed his torch at them and caught the defendant in the act but my efforts proved abortive. I was told he does not live in the area, he was just a passerby,” she said. Justice Sybil Nwaka adjourned the case until June 18 for continuation of trial.
