For your time whenever I call or visit to have a conversation. You’re a #fatherfigure, & I have framed this photo with those golden words you whispered to me after my speech at the FCT spelling bee in 2016. Happy #retirement #cyrilstober pic.twitter.com/K5CW99E4dl — Not A Failed Dream (@Justbrainbox) April 21, 2019  Cyril Stober speaking meant absolute silence every 9pm. My dad will fuck you up if you decide to start shit when that man was speaking. — Daddy D.O (@DOlusegun) April 20, 2019  His former colleague and special adviser to the president on diaspora matters Abike Dabiri also joined those who have something to say about the veteran broadcaster. Haba!!!He retired but NTA still retained him on a contract basis, What is wrong with celebrating a man like Cyril Stober, anytime . Whether recently retired or not??? https://t.co/XsM6A5necP — Abike Dabiri-Erewa (@abikedabiri) April 21, 2019 Some Twitter users also tried to make compare Stober with TV host Ebuka Uchendu, but many kicked against it. If you did not watch Cyril Stober on NTA or you do not know him, then me and you no be mate. Secondly, please do not compare him with Ebuka. No be agbada competition we dey do here. — Izi Gab (@IziGab1) April 21, 2019  U pple just disrespect anyhow in dis country. Yesterday was legend Michael Jackson & Beyonce, 2day it’s veteran Cyril Stober & Ebuka. Cyril Stober that even the way he introduces himself is news. It’s not like Ebuka is not good o but no comparison. Thank you for listening https://t.co/y8OxPnGsH6 — Benny Umoren (@BennyUmoren) April 21, 2019  Ebuka is not a broadcaster. You definitely can’t compare him with Cyril Stober who is a seasoned broadcaster. — King’s Kid (@kingskidnaija) April 21, 2019  Those saying Ebuka is better than Cyril Stober, are the same people saying Wizkid is better than 2 Face. These kids forget that Cyril and 2 baba conquered their generation and also made a huge impact in this generation. These comparison is shameful — Uncle Mark™ (@iamUncleMark) April 21, 2019  Stop disrespecting Mr. Cyril Stober. Mr. Ebuka should just continue with his promising journalism career, but he shouldn’t be, in any way, compared to Cyril Stober. Mr. Stober remains one of the veteran journalists that will always be remembered as far as journalism is concerned. https://t.co/TD9XiPwh7N — Muhd El-Bonga Ibrahim (@el_bonga) April 21, 2019  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
