Africa’s powerhouse, Egypt and Nigeria yesterday boosted their chances of qualifying for slots in the 2019 ITTF World Junior Championships scheduled for Thailand next December with victories in their opening matches at the International Table Tennis Federation African Junior and Cadet Championships holding in Ghana. In the matches decided yesterday, Egypt defeated Sierra Leone and South Africa 3-0 apiece, while Nigeria, who walloped host Ghana 3-0, also subdued Tunisia 3-1 in her second game to be in good stead for a place in the knockout round. Tunisia, which had earlier lost to Nigeria, however, came back strongly to record a 3-1 victory over Congo DRC, just as Algeria put up a good showing to also heighten her chance of a qualification for the next stage of the competition.
Out of the 19 teams competing in Ghana, only two countries will eventually qualify for Thailand next December in both the boys and girls events. And the knowledge of limited spots to the world junior and cadet championships is evident among the players in Accra. Other matches scheduled for yesterday as at press time were South Africa taking on Sierra Leone, while Tunisia battled Ghana, and Nigeria slugged it out with Congo DRC, just as Libya was scheduled to clash with Togo in the boys’ event. Winners for the two spots of the championships for Thailand will be decided on April 13 when the tournament is expected to end.
