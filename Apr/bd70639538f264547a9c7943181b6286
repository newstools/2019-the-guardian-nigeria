After strutting the runway and turning heads at the Arise Fashion week held last weekend, Noami Campbel is out and about Lagos showing how excellent a role model she is. The British supermodel, along with the Vigue magazine editor and stylist Edward Enninful, paid a visit to Hearts of Gold Hospice orphanage in Nigeria. Campbell and Enninful spent an afternoon cradling tots at the orphanage, which supports abandoned children with life-threatening conditions, while in the ­African country for Arise Fashion Week.
