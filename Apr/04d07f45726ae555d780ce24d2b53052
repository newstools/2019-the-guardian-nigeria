They were arrested at Mile 2 underbridge “while at each other’s throat.” According to Elkana, “both suspects were arrested after they engaged each other in fisticuffs following the failure of one of the parties to keep to the terms of agreement regarding the theft of female pants. “According to Friday Emmanuel, Obiora Nwabueze tasked him to steal used female pants for a fee of N30,000. However, after he had successfully accomplished the task, Nwabueze reneged on his promise and forcefully attempted to take the pants from him, which led to the exchange of blows. “During interrogation, Emmanuel regretted listening to his friend, Obiora, who was pestering him to get female underwear he desperately needed to become rich.
