Wife of Ekiti State governor, Bisi Fayemi, will feature in a special public reading session on Tuesday, April 23, in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital. The event is a reading awareness walk and colloquium organised by OpenWay Global Concepts, in conjunction with a non-government organisation, The Convergence. Youths drawn from various organisations are expected to walk for two kilometres to create reading awareness. Chief Executive Officer, OpenWay Global Concepts, Adesina Adetola said the event is designed to promote the objective of the World Book and Copyright Day, celebrated on April 23. He said: “For any society to attain the net level of development, every leader must be a reader. It is on this ground that UNESCO sets aside every April 23 to encourage literary works and promote its relevance in national development. “It is our belief that the project would certainly contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal 4; to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote life-long learning opportunities for all.” In the same vein, leader of The Convergence, Tosin Adara said, “It is a fact that you can never grow more than your mental capacity and what you read is whom you are. We are organising this event to rekindle the dying reading culture.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
