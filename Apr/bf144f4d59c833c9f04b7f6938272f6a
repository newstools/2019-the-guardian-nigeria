Menstrual cramps are common pains experienced by women before and during the period which cause major discomfort. While making use of prescribed drugs, like aspirins, may be advised, it is also good to note that natural remedies are available and efficient like the few explained below; Stay Hydrated One common remedy for menstrual cramps is to stay hydrated; in other words, drink more water; this helps to ease bloating which makes symptoms worse. Get in the habit of drinking six to eight glasses of water each day, especially during your period. Add some mint or a lemon wedge to make it more palatable, if you dislike its plain taste. While youâ€™re at it, back off of the salt, which encourages fluid retention and bloating. Diet Is Key Your dietary and lifestyle habits can either relieve or worsen period cramps. If you experience monthly menstrual discomfort, it is advisable to avoid certain foods like refined foods including sugar, glazed doughnuts, bread, and pasta. Avoid trans-fatty acids that are found most often in, for example, French fries, cookies, onion rings, crackers, and margarine. Ditch alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine. All of these things increase inflammation and may encourage period pain. In replacing tea or anything caffeine-related, you can indulge in sipping chamomile tea which may help reduce cramps when you menstruate.  Try The Heat Therapy Placing a hot water bottle or heating pad against the abdomen can relax the muscles and relieve cramps. Study shows heat helps the uterine muscle and those around it relax, which may ease cramping and discomfort. One can also place a heating pad on the lower back to get rid of back pain. Another option is to soak in a warm bath, which can help relax the muscles in the abdomen, back, and legs. In the absence of any of the above, massages, mild exercises and reducing hectic routines should be implored.
