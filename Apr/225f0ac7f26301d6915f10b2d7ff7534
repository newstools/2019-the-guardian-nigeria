The British American Tobacco Nigeria (BATN) has rewarded 322 farmers for driving responsible production and championing efforts to put an end to child labour in the agricultural sector. This gesture was expressed at the BATN 2019 Farmers’ Productivity Awards ceremony, held at the BATN Leaf Head office, Iseyin, Oyo State. This year’s award ceremony, which marks its 14th edition, is themed: ‘End Child Labour.’ The awards is an initiative of BATN, designed to recognise tobacco farmers for attaining and delivering the planned tobacco leaf volumes through sustainable and environmentally friendly agricultural practices, and their commitment towards eradication of child labour. In the opening address, the Operations Director, BATN, Waseem Hayat, identified compliance with activities focused on ending child labour as one of the key measures of success for the farmers, who received the awards at the occasion. He said: ”The choice of the message for this year’s Farmers’ Awards reflects our unyielding advocacy against the use of school age children in any form within the value chain involved in the production and sale of our tobacco products.” In his address, the Legal and External Affairs Director, BATN, Freddy Messanvi, commended the farmers for their longstanding partnership with the company and resilience in the face of socio-economic challenges in the country. He said the 2019 Farmers’ Awards was the company’s way of appreciating successful farmers for their compliance with set guidelines. Also speaking, Permanent Secretary, Oyo State Ministry of Agriculture, Mr. Victor Adewale Atilola, described BATN’s gesture as a source of motivation for farmers and expressed the state government’s satisfaction with the partnership and in particular the assured market BATN provides for the tobacco farmers. The items given out include: motorcycles, refrigerators, generators, standing fans and mobile telephones. A pickup van was also donated by BATN to the Forestry Department of the Oyo State Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development to support the ministry’s day-to-day official and business activities.
