 Scrabble board  The  qualifiers, which had the 24 top scrabble players from across the country in attendance, gave the players the opportunity to earn points that would qualify them for the world championship slated for Goa, India later this year.
 
According to the NSF, the qualifiers have so far brought out the best in the players and also given the board more insight on their level of commitment to Nigeria’s ambition at the championship.National scrabble coach, Prince Anthony Ikolo told The Guardian yesterday that the competition for places in the world championship has been tight, adding, however, “we expected the competition to be high because all the best scrabble players in Nigeria are jostling for places in the World Championship. “The third round has ended. The next and final round of the qualifiers will take place in Port Harcourt from April 24 to 28. After the qualifiers, the successful players will be listed for the world championship.”Ikolo called on corporate organisations to sponsor the scrabble contingent’s preparations to defend the World English Players Association title in India.The first stanza of the qualifiers was held in  Port Harcourt, while the second was in Lagos. Following the conclusion of the Edo round, the stage will now move to Port Harcourt where Nigeria’s final team will be selected by putting together the total points earned by each player.
