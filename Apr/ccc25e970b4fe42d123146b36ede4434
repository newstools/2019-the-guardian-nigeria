An estimated 800 filling stations were out of petrol in the region around the capital Lisbon and 400 around the northern city of Porto. The union which represents a majority of Portuguese truck drivers who haul dangerous materials went on strike on Monday seeking a wage hike and special protections. The government on Tuesday ordered a certain number of drivers back to work in order to ensure a minimum service to airports, ports, emergency services, public transport and 40 percent of filling stations in the Lisbon and Porto regions as the country begins marking a three-day holiday weekend for Easter on Friday. “The minimum service will be enlarged if necessary,” Prime Minister Antonio Costa told lawmakers in a debate on Wednesday.
