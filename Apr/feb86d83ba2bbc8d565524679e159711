April 19 to 21 2019, saw some of African and global fashion’s elite gathered at Lagos Continental Hotel, Victoria Island to celebrate some of the biggest industry designers and creative entrepreneurs. In a world where we’ve seen it all, we can be likened to running on a treadmill searching for that revolutionary style on the runway. With every fashion week comes an influx of new designs or a re-interpretation of an old one, what colours we should be wearing and what clothes should be burned when we get home. This guide serves to drive you in the right direction. Think of it as a mood board for your own personal interpretation. For seasons may come and go, fashion may fade but style – personal style – is eternal. Here are the Autumn/Winter ’19 fashion trends from ARISE Fashion Week 2019. Torlowei What do you do when you don’t want the restrictions of a skirt and the stereotypical look a wrapper will draw from passers-by? You go for a wrap skirt. As seen on Torlowei, it is tied around the waist into a knot or bow to create a stylish finish. This style of skirt is a one fits all. It can be paired up with heels, dressed down with flats and worn to the beach. It’s as functional an outfit as it is versatile a style. You can barely go wrong with this. Tokyo James It is butch, fashionable and will fit everything from your laptop to an extra shirt for that evening party you have after work. Tokyo James’s interpretation of the man bag is a must-have for every working man out there. Though this bag could double-up as a mini travelling bag, it is not for the faint-hearted. Wuman Brand Some of the artsy creations from the runway would be enough to make deceased fame painter Basquiat happy. Whether it is The Girl with The Pearl Earrings painting at Maison ARTC, the splash technique at Papa Oppong or the whimsies at Wumanbrand, the designs create a sense of style that transcends fashion. Depending on the styling, it could be worn during the day or at night. There is really no going wrong with these looks because we all know when it comes to art, personal expression is all that really matters. Gozel Green Less is more is synonymous to minimalism because less is more doesn’t mean it has to be boring. Gozel Green and Tzar understand this. The magic is the attention to detail; be it a carefully lined colour line or a technically placed pocket. These looks work now as it will twenty years from now. With no fuss about them, they’re not the kind of outfits that will necessarily scream when you walk into a room but that’s really the point of minimalism. Aduke Bey in Andrea Iyamah This look is definitely not for everyone. As seen at Andrea Iyamah and Esteban Cortazar, this look works for a day at the beach or a poolside party. Pair it with sunglasses and slides for both sexes and you’re to go. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-912378 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Style-Temple-768x1152.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1920" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Style-Temple-768x1152.jpg 768w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Style-Temple-399x598.jpg 399w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Style-Temple-371x557.jpg 371w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Style-Temple-743x1114.jpg 743w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Style-Temple-160x240.jpg 160w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Style-Temple-320x480.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Style-Temple-400x600.jpg 400w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Style-Temple.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> The bigger; the better. Some designers like Style Temple and Turfah have taken a liken to this trend and push the envelope by exaggerating it. This style for an outfit is definitely a showstopper and might not work for a wallflower. Made with bright colours, it needs a matching confidence to pull it off. The great thing is when wearing this look to an event, you don’t have to worry about over-eating, the layered ruffles is also a great cover-up. Naomi Campbell in Deola Sagoe Wearing a full-on colour is an easy way to make a lasting impression. Be it in burgundy red, custard yellow or from the neon family, this style is a stand-out. Not to be mixed or paired down with another colour, it could work for day and night. There are no rules to which colours to wear. Based on your personality and what colours you feel comfortable in, go for it. From Style Temple to Pyer Moss, Tokyo James to Deola Sagoe these designers are all keen on making this trend stay. Not reserved for just one gender, this look is for anybody.
