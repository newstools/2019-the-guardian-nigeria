 OPEC Headquarters, Vienna  Steep decline
Venezuela reported a production figure of 960,000 b/d, down by a massive 472,000 b/d, as power outages and U.S. sanctions cripple the South American oil producer.Saudi Arabia’s crude output fell 289,000 b/d in March, to average 9.79 million b/d, according to an average of the six secondary sources that OPEC uses to gauge production.
  
The kingdom also self-reported production of 9.79 million b/d, its lowest since January 2017 and a fall of 350,000 b/d month on month. That is much below its quota of 10.31 million b/d under the cut agreement.The kingdom has decreased production by 1.30 million b/d since November when it pumped a record-high of 11.09 million b/d.
  
At the last OPEC meeting in Vienna, the group’s members agreed to slash output by 812,000 b/d, with Russia and nine other non-OPEC allies committing to a cut of 383,000 b/d for the first six months of 2019.Iraq’s production fell marginally to 4.52 million b/d in March, slightly above its quota of 4.51 million b/d, according to OPEC secondary sources.
 
In Iran, hit by U.S. sanctions, output was slight down, falling 28,000 b/d to 2.70 million b/d in March.Fellow exempt member Libya pumped 1.098 million b/d in March, up 196,000 b/d from the previous month, but output remains at risk as the country is on the brink of a possible civil war.
  
A key metric for the deal has been to lower oil inventories below the five-year average. OPEC said it has made some progress toward achieving this goal.OECD commercial oil inventories fell to 2.63 billion barrels in February and were only 7.5 million barrels above the five-year average, according to OPEC’s report. In December, stocks were 28 million barrels above the five-year average, showing that the producer group has made progress in balancing the market.Also, U.S. total commercial oil stocks fell by 15.6 million barrels to stand at 1.229 billion barrels in March, according to preliminary data.
