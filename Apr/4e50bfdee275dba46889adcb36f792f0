But the scientists said many challenges remain before fully working 3D printed hearts will be available for transplant into patients. Journalists were shown a 3D print of a heart about the size of a cherry at Tel Aviv University on Monday as the researchers announced their findings, published in the journal Advanced Science. Researchers must now teach the printed hearts “to behave” like real ones. Then they plan to transplant them into animal models, said Dvir. “Maybe, in 10 years, there will be organ printers in the finest hospitals around the world, and these procedures will be conducted routinely,” he said. But he said hospitals would likely start with simpler organs than hearts. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
