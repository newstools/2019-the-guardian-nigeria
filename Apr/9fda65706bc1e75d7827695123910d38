We don’t want give it any opportunities.” “There are nine games, if we win six we are champions,” he added. “But having to win six games does not mean we have the league won, we have a lot of work to do.” Valverde said he did not think renewed rumours that Antoine Griezmann was going to leave Atletico for Barcelona would not destabilise either club. “It’s the usual stuff, we’re used to it,” said Valverde.
