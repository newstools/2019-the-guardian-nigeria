Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Abuja Zonal Office, have arrested five suspected train ticket racketeers.EFCC acting spokesperson, Tony Orilade, stated yesterday in Abuja that the commission swung into action after receiving intelligence that some people at the Idu and Kubwa train stations had been racketeering train tickets, thereby sabotaging governmentâ€™s efforts towards easy transportation across the country. Racketeering makes it difficult for passengers to have access to tickets, as prices are hiked and the commodity hoarded.The suspects include, Clement Zakka, Samson Udim, Adams Danladi, Otitomoni Omobolanle and Hassan Dauda. According to Orilade, the suspects, who were arrested during a sting operation at the stations on Saturday, will soon be charged to court.Also, operatives of the Kaduna office arrested ticket racketeers at the Rigasa Train Station on Sunday. Investigations revealed that some staff of the station, in connivance with some touts, were defrauding unsuspecting travellers by hiking prices of tickets. Economy tickets of between N1,300 and N1,500 were sold at N2,000 to N5,000, while first class ticket of N2,500 was sold for between N7,000 and N15,000. An employee of the station and two touts were arrested.The station manager, chief marketing officer and chief parcel booking officer of the Kaduna Railway Station have also been invited for questioning.
