Ten months after the Federal Government re-awarded contract for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the Lagos-Ota-Abeokuta Expressway, the job has been going on at snail’s pace.Despite the presence of the contractor- Julius Berger Plc. on site, the motion without movement scenario playing out there has simply made the road to go from bad to worse with motorists being the worst hit.
 
It would be recalled that the Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing on May 14, 2018 officially inaugurated the rehabilitation of the road, which is valued at N22. 387b. The Director, Federal Highways, South West, Olalekan Busari, while briefing journalists during the flag-off said the total rehabilitation starts from Ile Zik Bus Stop at kilometre zero, up to kilometre 80 in Ogun State, where a brewery is located.
 
“The project was divided into two sections, the first section, which starts from Ile Zik in Lagos State spans about 20 km, while the second section, which falls in Ogun State is 60km.“It is a complete total rehabilitation of the entire road this time around and it is awarded at N22.387b, and for a contract period of two and half years, which we hope the contractor will actually deliver,” he said.
