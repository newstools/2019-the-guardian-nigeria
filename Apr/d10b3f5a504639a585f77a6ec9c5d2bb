Some few days ago, we reported that Nigerian singer, Demmie Vee called out fellow singer, Kizz Daniel for allegedly being a traitor. In his allegation, Demmie Vee alleged that he helped Kizz Daniel with N15 million to resurrect his failing career among other accusations. In a follow-up post, Demmie Vee has now revealed that he never signed a record label deal with FlyBoi Inc owned by Kizz Daniel but a management deal. Taking to Instagram to apologise for calling out Kizz Daniel, Demmie Vee shared: “A lot of people complained about me joining Flyboi inc. Let me make this more clear to you all, I never sign a record label deal with Kizz Daniel but a management deal. A management deal where I can always have someone am looking up to…We needed proper management after tiff has blown. And a good team to work with. Kizz Daniel was someone I have always looked up to as my GF in the industry which made myself and my CEO decide to approach FBI for this management deal. Also for us to be able to grow FLYBOI together. Kizz has always been a good person to me with a good heart. I am using this opportunity to let everyone understand that I am truly sorry for everything this whole drama might have caused the whole Flyboi Management/Team. I will forever appreciate what you guys have done for me. From the bottom of my heart I am saying am sorry. Let’s love lead. And to all upcoming act out there. Always remember patience is a virtue. #Surulere”. It would be recalled that Kizz Daniel recently started the #FvckYouChallenge and it has since gone viral. The music challenge has seen celebrities call-out each other and air their grievances and issues with a fellow artist. The likes of CDQ, Simi, Tiwa Savage, Victoria Kimani, Dremo are just some of the popular names that have since jumped on the challenge.
