•Digital service shows potential in Nigeria, others
Global e-commerce sales grew by 13 per cent in 2017, hitting an estimated $29 trillion, according to the latest numbers released by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
 
The report noted that a similar surge was seen in the number of online shoppers, which jumped by 12 per cent and stood at 1.3 billion, or one quarter of the world’s population.Though most Internet buyers purchased goods and services from domestic vendors, the share of those buying from abroad rose from 15 per cent in 2015 to 21 per cent in 2017, as growth was driven mainly by an increase in the United States.
 
As a result, cross-border business-to-consumer (B2C) sales reached an estimated $412 billion, accounting for almost 11 per cent of total B2C e-commerce, representing four per cent increase from the previous year’s numbers.  And a least developed country in West Africa, Sierra Leone, emerged third in digitally deliverable services, as a share of all service exports.“From an economic development perspective, this is important, because it shows the potential of digitalisation for businesses in developing countries that are producing such services,” said Shamika N. Sirimanne, who directs trade and logistics division at UNCTAD.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
