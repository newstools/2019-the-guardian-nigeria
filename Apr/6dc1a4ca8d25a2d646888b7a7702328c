 James O. James  • To them, it was a serious loss; a personal disappointment because Jesus was not only very popular, but their hope for prominence was hinged on him. So, when He died like a common criminal all their plans evaporated like smoke.
  • They had left all to follow Him, thinking He would establish an earthly kingdom and compensate them for their sacrifices. Where were they going to start from after all they had abandoned to follow Him?
  • Their hope was arrested, beaten, mocked, tortured, spat upon, humiliated, crucified, buried and a stone placed over His tomb. Therefore, they must have felt deceived and scammed. Many are feeling this way today. There is so much fear and uncertainty out there, and the rate of suicide is rising daily because many people have lost hope. Indeed, statistics show that out of every 100,000 people who commit suicide around the world, 15,000 are Nigerians, ranking us the 5th country with the highest suicide rate. Even Pastors are not immune from this, as many are abandoning their calling because of discouragement. Job said, “If a man dies, will he live again?” This question is actually asking if there is hope after death. Someone once said, “if you take money from a man, you can hinder him; if you take purpose from a man you can slow him down, but if you take hope from a man, you have finished him.” When hope is lost, all is lost. When the devil was doing his bit, it is as if God didn’t know what to do, but on that resurrection day, God brought out His joker. He allowed them to do all these things to Jesus, watching until they had done their worst. God has a joker reserved for you. He will allow them to mock you, ridicule and laugh at you but you will laugh last. Do not lose hope, as God has your best interest in mind. Jesus’ resurrection is a proof that there is no hopeless situation with God. Job 14:14b says, “My change is coming, so I will wait for it”. Waiting is the anticipation that good is coming; that tomorrow shall be better than today. Your change is a certainty, whether the devil likes it or not. Jesus said in John 14:19b, “Because I live, you shall live also”. He rose the third day from the grave and the hope of His disciples and all mankind was restored. Their sorrow was turned to joy. Friend, no matter what you are going through, it is not the end of the road for you. If Jesus conquered death and the grave, you too can conquer that situation. All you need do is to put your trust in Jesus, Who has power over life and death. Alleluia, He rose and is alive forevermore; therefore it shall be well with you!
