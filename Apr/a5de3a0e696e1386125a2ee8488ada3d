Michael Phelps is hoping to have a little girl instead of another baby boy running around the house. The retired competitive swimmer, who announced in February that he and his wife Nicole Johnson Phelps are expecting their third child, says during in a recent interview that it would be nice to have a daughter. “[I’d] love a girl, and I think Nicole would hope for a girl as well,” he tells PEOPLE. “We have a Daddy’s boy and a Mommy’s boy, so maybe we can get a Daddy’s girl and a Mommy’s girl.” “Everyone talks about how awesome girls are, so I look forward to having that opportunity,” he shares, adding that he won’t be disappointed if the couple ends up having another son but that it might make things a bit chaotic. “If we get lucky enough to have a third boy, it is going to be craziness in our house,” Phelps, jokes. The couple are already parents to sons Beckett Richard, 14 months, and Boomer Robert, 3 [next] month.  Read More: Team Phelps: Michael and Nicole Phelps Are Expecting Their Third Child
