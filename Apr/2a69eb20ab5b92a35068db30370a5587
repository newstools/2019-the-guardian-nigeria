As part of its social responsibility to the community, the Saro Lifecare Limited, producers of Sniper insecticide spray, has organised free malaria tests for residents of Abesan community and Ebute Metta, both in Lagos State. Dr. Ajayi Adepero, who led a medical crew at the event tagged: “Zero Malaria starts with me,” said hundreds of residents benefited from the scheme. She added that they were diagnosed for malaria on the spot and those who were tested got their results in less than 15 minutes. The whole idea of organising the programme, according to her, was to adopt viable ways to prevent malaria, one of which is the use of Sniper insecticide spray to prevent mosquito bites. The Managing Director, Mr. Santanu Sarma, who described malaria as one of the oldest and deadliest diseases affecting man, said: “In essence, leaders in public and private sectors need to step up, especially those who control government policy decisions and budgets. A country will thrive when private sector companies benefit from a malaria-free workforce.” Agreeing with Sarma, Head of Marketing and Innovation, Mr. Christian Ubani said the company had keyed into the World Malaria Day celebration as part of its social responsibility to help fight the menace.
