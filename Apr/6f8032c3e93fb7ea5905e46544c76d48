Iran is Israel’s main enemy, and Netanyahu has been in full support of the Trump administration’s aggressive stance against Tehran. The White House said its intention was to “bring Iran’s oil exports to zero” with its latest move. Trump last year withdrew the United States from a multilateral 2015 accord negotiated by his predecessor, Barack Obama, under which Iran drastically scaled back its nuclear program in return for promises of sanctions relief. The Trump administration, backed by Saudi Arabia and Israel, has instead unilaterally imposed sanctions and demanded that other countries follow suit. Eight governments were initially given six-month reprieves from the unilateral US sanctions on Iran. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
