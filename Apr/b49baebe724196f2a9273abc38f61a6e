The Nigerian Senate Tuesday resolved to investigate the appointment of new Director General of National Youth Service Corps, Brigadier General Shaibu Ibrahim. Senator Dino Melaye, representing Kogi west, raised a point of order that informed the Senate on the infraction on the Constitution by the Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Tukur Buratai. The COAS, according to Melaye, perpetrated an infraction in appointing a new DG for the NYSC. The Senator argued that a Director General is to be appointed by the President, according to Section 5 of the NYSC act. “The Act gave authority to the President. Previous Directors-General were appointed by the President. We are not in a banana republic. NYSC is not a formation of the Nigerian Army but on the enactment of the National Assembly. “We should not allow a Constitutional country governed by laws be taken for granted,” Senator Melaye said. A statement by the Army on April 26 announced the appointment of Ibrahim who replaced Major General Suleiman Kazaure. The appointment was part of a series of postings across the Nigerian Army. Senator Bassey Akpan seconded the Order by Senator Dino Melaye and requested it to be investigated. The Senate eventually referred the matter to the Committee on Youths and Sports to investigate the matter and report within a week. Senate President Bukola Saraki ordered the Chairman, Senate Committee on Youths and Sports, Senator Obinna Ogba, to ensure that the “report should be back, laid and considered as it is straight forward”.
