The African Association of Professional Freight Forwarders of Nigeria (APFFLON) has frowned at multiple checks by different task forces that litter major roads across the country, querying the wisdom behind reopening and reexamining already exited containers by the roadside after battling with series of alerts placed on the same consignments by various Customs units at the port. This practice, he said, jeopardises the economy and causes unnecessary loss of man-hours and traffic gridlocks, aside an indictment on Customs at the various examination bays, as well as on Releasing Officers. Rising from an emergency general meeting, the Association’s president, Otunba Frank Ogunojemite, said Customs should ensure at all times that officers operate within the ambit of the law. He said in as much as the body appreciates the Nigeria Customs for remaining committed in revenue collection and anti-smuggling campaign, stakeholders should also be carried along in its policies. He stated this following the recent threat to down tools by a coalition of freight forwarders, due to alleged multiple checks by men and officers of the Nigeria Customs. Lending his voice on the need for transparency, Ogunojemite urged Freight Forwarders to be patriotic in their dealings by not circumventing the law.
