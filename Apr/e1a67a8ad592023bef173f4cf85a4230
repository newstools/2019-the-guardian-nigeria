The Oyo State government will enact Grazing Control Bill, which will be passed into law before April 30 to forestall the age-long farmers/herders conflicts in the state. The Special Adviser to Governor Abiola Ajimobi on Community Relations, Mr. Abidemi Siyanbade, said this during a stakeholders meeting organised by the state Police Command at Eleyele, Ibadan. Siyanbade said: “Before the end of this month, Grazing Control Bill will be passed by the House of Assembly. We will also ensure that the peace committee meeting at the local government levels will be revived. The State Commissioner of Police, Mr.  Shina Olukolu condemned the use of minors as shepherds and warned that both the farmers and herders must not let the long-standing relationship between them be jeopardised. The State Chairman, All Farmers’ Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Mr. Adeniji Moses lamented that the bill had been promised since 2016 and nothing had been done about it. The state Chairman, Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, Yakubu Bello commended the Oyo State  Police for organising the meeting.
