Wendy Williams, during the Friday broadcast of The Wendy Williams Show, made cryptic jokes about her marital status. The episode had been pre-taped on Thursday after Williams hosted the live show without wearing her wedding ring — or mentioning any marital issues — just before news of her divorce broke. During the “Ask Wendy” segment, a newly single fan sought advice from the host about jumping back into the dating scene. “I don’t mind a dating app,” Williams said. After finding out that the fan works in corporate development and technology, Williams said a dating app might be the right fit for her. “If you had a more fun job where there was more socialization, then I would say a dating app, well, you don’t really need that,” she said. “Because I always prefer a face-to-face. But I don’t mind a dating app [for you.]” It was confirmed on Thursday that Williams, 54, is splitting from her longtime love and manager Kevin Hunter. The daytime talk show host filed for divorce after two decades of marriage, PEOPLE reports. A representative for her show also released the following statement to PEOPLE saying: “Wendy and her family have been a part of Debmar-Mercury for over 10 years,. We respect their privacy regarding personal matters. As always, we remain committed to bringing an entertaining and topical show to our viewers.” Williams and Hunter tied the knot on November 30, 1997, and share a 19-year-old son Kevin Jr.
