Insist he’s deceiving Kogi electorate 
Inter-party Advisory Council (IPAC) and Conference of Nigerian Political parties (CNPP) Kogi State have dismissed Mustapha Audu’s claim that 17 political parties adopted him for the November governorship election, saying it is a fraud and open deceit. A statement signed by Badanga Ilias of IPAC and Haruna Yakubu of CNPP in Lokoja yesterday explained that the purported endorsement was staged-managed to cajole the Kogi electorate. Mustapha Audu, son of the late Governor Abubakar Audu, had claimed that 17 political parties adopted him to contest the seat in Lugard House. He laid the claim at the Children Amusement Park, Lokoja, last Wednesday, while declaring his intention to join the Kogi governorship race on the platform of the Young Progressive Party (YPP).Kogi gubernatorial poll comes up in November 2019. In the statement, IPAC and CNPP indicated that none of the chairmen whose parties fell victim of “the 419 declaration” had prior knowledge of Audu’s action.
It pointed out that the aspirant carried out the fraudulent act in connivance with the YPP state chairman, Mr. Emmanuel Chinga. Chinga, he added, will be suspended indefinitely from all activities of Kogi IPAC and CNPP. According to the statement, the combined leadership of IPAC and CNPP resolved at an emergency general meeting last Friday, at the IPAC/CNPP office in Lokoja, that the endorsement is not only untrue, fraudulent, criminal and deceitful, but unfortunate.“For the umpteenth time, Mr. Chinga had once again demonstrated that he is the leopard that can never change his spots when it comes to chasing dollar and naira for his private pocket,” it stated.As part of their resolutions, the group has briefed lawyers to legally take up the matter with Audu, the YPP state chairman and his national chairman to serve as deterrent.
