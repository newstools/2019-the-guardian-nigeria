Across all social media platforms, a 26-year-old girl identified as Lizzy has been the subject of discussion after a video of her surfaced on the internet. Rescued by Pastor Tony Rapu, senior pastor The House of Freedom, she, in the video, said that she is an alumnus of two of the most expensive schools in Lagos, Caleb British International Primary School and Vivian Fowler (alledging receiving 2 million per session.) Although she said that she was introduced by her boyfriend to heroine over seven years ago and begs on the streets for N2000 to be able to afford drugs, what caught the interest of the public are the schools she attended.

One of such is Tomisin Ogunnubi, who developed an app that helps track lost children when she was just 12 years old. Meanwhile, Lizzy has begun rehabilitation. Nigerians, since the disclaimer have been reacting: Nigerians are foolish and make everything about themselves. So Vivian Fowler did press statement to let the World know Lizzy isn’t alumni.
