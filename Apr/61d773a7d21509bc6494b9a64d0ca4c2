 Oyo State governor-elect, Mr. Seyi Makinde  In a statement signed by Prince Dotun Oyelade and made available to The Guardian in Ibadan yesterday, Makinde saidÂ he was satisfied with the level of rapport he had with the Congress during and after the election and hopes it would be maintained as the new NLC executive assumes the mantle of leadership. Makinde said nothing short of the interest of workers will be acceptable to his administration as he applauded the rancour-free consensus that heralded the new President as a good sign that democratic maturity has always been a virtue of the NLC. Querying the intention and sincerity of the outgoing government to open negotiation with labour last Monday, Makinde said there is nothing the outgoing government wants to achieve other than to complicate things for the in-coming government.
