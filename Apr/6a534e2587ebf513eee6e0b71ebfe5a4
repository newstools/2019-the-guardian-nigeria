 [FILE PHOTO] Forest  The Conservator-General of the service, Ibrahim Goni disclosed this while delivering a paper on “The Use of indigenous fauna resources on mascots in Nigerian Army” in Abuja. Goni expressed delight that the Army will be using its service in the project to establish mini zoos and parks in all its cantonments. According to him, the collaboration would enhance conservation and protection of  natural assets and guarantee the potential use of species  as mascots in the Nigerian Army formations across the country. He said that Mascots could be an animal, person, or thing adopted by a group as its representative symbol and which tends to bring good luck to the user. The Conservator General explained that the idea of using indigenous species as mascots is a move towards actualising the NPS mandate on National Biodiversity action Plan. “As you are considering an animal mascot for your organisation, the symbolic characteristics of popular animals can quickly set the tone for your brand and message.” “Whether you are looking to entertain a younger audience with a cute kitten or intimidate an opposing team with a snarling wolf, animal mascots are an effective way to engage audiences and represent your team, business, or a project”. He told the army to take the necessary steps to research before making its choice of mascots and settle on a specific one to represent, or match the audience and organisation as well as the community.
  
Earlier, Maj.-Gen. E. G. Ode of Nigeria Army Special Project (NASP) said the army is poised to taking up the challenges to proper safe keep of the mascots by taking care of the cost of feeding, medical care, sustainable accommodation.
