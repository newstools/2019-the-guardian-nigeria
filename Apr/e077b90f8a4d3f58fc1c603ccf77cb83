MFM FC Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries Football Club (MFM FC) midfielder, Julius Emiloju, believes his team can repeat the feat it achieved against Enugu Rangers Football Club in their first encounter this season. The two teams clash in today’s match day 16 of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) slated for the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium in Enugu State. The defeat inflicted on Rangers in Lagos so far remains the only loss the Flying Entelopes have suffered this season. The Flying Antelope are currently NPFL group A leader with 28 points with just 13 games, while the Olukoya Boys are third after amassing 24 points in 15 matches. The hosts will be hoping to revenge their defeat in the hands of the Lagos based club at the Agege Stadium in Lagos. Speaking to the MFM FC Media, Emiloju said they have what it takes to shock their hosts and come out unruffled at the end of today’s encounter. “Enugu Rangers are just like every other NPFL side. I don’t see anything special about the club. Our game against them will be like other NPFL’s fixtures.” “We know how to play Rangers. If you look at the statistics, you will realise that it has always been a tight contest between us,” he said. The Olukoya Boys utility player believes that the defeat they inflicted on the Coal City boys can be repeated in today game. “I believe we have all that it takes to surprise them. We are confident we can do it again because we’re the only team that has beaten them this season. We have all it takes to shock Rangers,” he stated.
