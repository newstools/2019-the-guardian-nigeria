Former Abia State Governor, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu has called for sanctions against the All Progressives Congress (APC) leaders from the Southeast, who allegedly negotiated 25 percent for President Muhammadu Buhari from the zone in the last presidential election. Kalu said such negotiation was uncalled for, as it hampered efforts of genuine party members to deliver the zone for the president. The senator-elect, who spoke at the Southeast Stakeholders’ meeting in Enugu, said but for that negotiation, the party could have on its own given President Buhari 80 percent in the zone.He urged the party’s Southeast national vice chairman, Chief Emma Eneukwu to set up a committee to investigate those behind the negotiations and if found guilty, should be shown the way out. Minister for Science and Technology, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu said the party’s performance in the zone in the last election was a major improvement compared to that of 2015.He advocated unity of members in the zone for the party’s progress. “I believe that if the Southeast people come together, they will surprise Nigeria. If we resolve to work together, there is nothing we cannot achieve,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
