Ellen DeGeneres had “The Daily Show” host Trevor Noah as a guest on Tuesday and they both had a really fun time. Trevor explained to Ellen why President Donald Trump is no longer his dream guest, but instead, it’s his wife, First Lady Melania Trump. During the “Who’d You Rather?” game often played on the show, Ellen helped him find a potential girlfriend where he chooses between Tiffany Haddish, Rihanna, Jennifer Aniston, Nicki Minaj, and Khloé Kardashian (who Ellen was willing to hook him up with). He also spoke about how different New York drivers are compared to the ones in California. Watch:
