Country Representative for the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Mr. Suffyan Koroma, says 120,000 livestock owners will be vaccinated against animal diseases in Borno State. The contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP) and Pestes des Ruminants (PPR) in Sub-Saharan Africa has cost the state about $60 million (N21.6 billion). Koroma in a statement yesterday in Maiduguri disclosed that the vaccination was to protect herds and livestock owners that depend on them for sustenance. He lamented that the diseases caused poor nutrition in the state. According to him, the United Nations agency is committed to ensuring that livestock owners in the state are protected to have resources to rebuild their lives. His words: “This vaccination campaign is part of a larger agriculture support initiative in Borno, being implemented by FAO and funded by the European Union (EU). “The action, primarily targeting vulnerable persons, will assist 100,000 households to restore agriculture-based livelihoods for three years.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
