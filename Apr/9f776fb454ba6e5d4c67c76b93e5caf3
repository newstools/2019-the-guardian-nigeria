 [FILE PHOTO] Golf  Oboh’s Sunshine Ladies tour came to a successful end last Thursday. The teenager made the cut in the last event and appeared to be trending in the right direction with scores of 80/79/75 over the three days. 
 
She made quite an impression on the more experienced lady professionals on the Sunshine tour such that Dhlamini, who is also a member of the Ladies European Tour, said she has already become a role model for other aspiring African professionals. She encouraged the teenager to keep focusing and learning the trade keenly.  The winner will get just about 15 per cent of that fund and the rest split to all players that made the cut after two days of 36 holes of golf.
