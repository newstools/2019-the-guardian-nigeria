 Lagos high court, Igbosere. Photo/wikipedia  According to the prosecution, the video, found on the internet, showed Adamu confessing to the crime, during a press interview conducted by former Commissioner of Police in Lagos, Fatai Owoseni. But the defence prayed the court to reject the video, arguing among others that the document does not indicate the name of the officer that produced it.
 
In her response Fagbai argued that the paramount thing to consider is whether the actual document is relevant. “The prosecution has complied, I urge you lordship to discountenance the objection the defence raised, as this document we sought to tender is very important and the original is before the court,” Fagbai said.
 
In her ruling yesterday, Justice Akinkugbe upheld the prosecution’s argument. She held that the electronically generated document complied with Section 84 of the Evidence Act and “is therefore admissible”. The case continues on May 21.
