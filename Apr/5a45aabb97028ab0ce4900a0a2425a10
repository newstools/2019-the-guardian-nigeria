The Governorship Election Petition Tribunal Tuesday ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission to allow Oyo Governor-elect, Seyi Makinde inspect election materials used during March 9 gubernatorial election in the state. Makinde polled 515,621 votes to defeat his major contender Adebayo Adelabu of the All Progressives Congress who had 357,982 votes. But Adelabu filed a petition at the tribunal against INEC for declaring Makinde of the PDP winner of the governorship election. The APC gubernatorial candidate argued that the election was rigged and Makinde couldn’t have won the governorship election. Makinde’s Counsel Jamiu Makinde informed the court that the respondents had filed an expert application seeking the order of the tribunal to inspect all the election materials used in the March 9 election. The governor-elect counsel said that the application was brought under section 281 (1, 2) of the Electoral Act 2010 as amended. The chairman of the three-man panel, Justice Muhammad Sirajo, granted Makinde’s appeal to inspect all the election materials used in the election. .
