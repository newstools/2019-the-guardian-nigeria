It appears Kelly Clarkson’s 4-year-old daughter, River Rose,  is a brutal critique; thank God she’s not an American Idol judge. While chatting with Entertainment Tonight this week, Clarkson revealed her kids couldn’t care less that their mom is a pop superstar. “They do not care anymore. They’re not impressed,” she joked, before sharing a hilarious story about how her 4-year-old girl gave her harsh feedback after a recent rehearsal performance. “She was like, ‘Mommy, you know when you’re on stage and you were singing?’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, baby.’ I was thinking like a compliment was about to come. She was like, ‘Yeah, I was really bored,'” Clarkson recalled. Ouch!   Love when the kids come see me on set!  #TheVoiceS15  Mua: @gloglomakeup  Hair: @robertramoshair Stylist: @cdicelove13 Nails: @nailsbytsha  Photo: @weisseubanks  Dress: @balmain Shoes: @maisonvalentino A post shared by  Kelly Clarkson (@kellyclarkson) on Nov 13, 2018 at 5:21pm PST  “But they don’t care, they’re over it. They see it all the time,” she said of River and her little brother, Remington, 2. Still, there is one rock star River gives rave reviews to — Coldplay singer Chris Martin. Last August, Clarkson shared a sweet video of River swooning over Martin and his hit single “Yellow.” “You like his song?” Clarkson can be heard asking her daughter in the video. “I like his song,” River replies, “and I wanna kiss him.” Now you know, Clarkson. Be like Coldplay!
