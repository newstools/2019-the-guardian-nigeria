 [FILE PHOTO] President General of Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief John Nnia Nwodo (Jnr)  In a statement issued yesterday by the deputy national leader, Dr. Kingsley Dozie, the youths of the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation posited that no zone should be denied a principal position in the next National Assembly as a punishment for how it voted in the last elections. The youths endorsed the aspiration of Nkeiruka Onyejeocha, an All Progressives Congress (APC) lawmaker representing Isuikwuato/Umunneochi constituency in Abia State, who is returning for a fourth term, for the seat of Speaker, House of Representatives. “Onyejeocha has all it takes to be speaker of the House of Representatives. She has distinguished herself as an astute, articulate, courageous and experienced lawmaker with impeccable track records, and has shown dexterity, competence and capacity in the discharge of her responsibilities, even as chairman of the House Committee on Aviation,” Dozie said. Apparently predicting that not choosing principal officers to reflect national balance would cause disaffection in the polity, the youths recalled last four years when the APC denied Southeast the senate presidency because the zone had no APC senator. “Now that we have ranking lawmakers of APC stock, the party should explain why the zone should not be considered for a principal office this time,” he added. Indicating that Ohanaeze youths would resist any plot to scheme out Ndigbo from the Nigerian political equilibrium this time, the release further stated: “APC can now know better why the agitation for self-determination has refused to abate, if Southeast is too unworthy to be considered for any principal office of the National Assembly.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
