 National Judicial Councilâ€¦PHOTO: Information Nigeria  In a statement by the Director of Information, NJC, Soji Oye, the council described the allegations relating to assets declaration levelled against Justice Onnoghen as subjudice and consequently, abstained from considering them. The decision was reached at the NJC emergency meeting convened to consider the report of the five-man committee constituted to investigate the allegations of misconduct made against Justice Onnoghen and the Acting CJN, Justice Tanko Muhammad. The Council also said to have reached a decision on the petitions written by Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) against Justice Onnoghen. While the council has conveyed its decision to President Muhammadu Buhari, it has however resolved that considering the nature of the decision reached, it would be inappropriate to make it public before conveying it to Buhari. Thus, it is not certain what the Council has emerged with on the said petitions. One Dennis Aghanya had petitioned the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) earlier in the year, alleging that Justice Onnoghen breached the public service rule by failing to declare some of his assets as stipulated by law.
