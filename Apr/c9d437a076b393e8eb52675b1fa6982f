President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed sadness over the latest violent clashes between Jukuns and Tivs in Taraba State, and among Fulani, Genjon and Bachama, in Adamawa State resulting in arson, injuries and deaths. Buhari said violence and bloodshed, for whatever reason, is unacceptable and condemnable, especially when it is coming as the nation celebrates Easter, with all the lessons of love and peace for humanity. The President, in a statement, yesterday, signed by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said: “Violence has not and cannot be the solution to the resolution of misunderstandings among the people. Once we abandon reason and good judgement, we are giving violence the chance to take over and make a bad situation more complicated and difficult to resolve…” The primary initiative for ending violence, once and for all, must originate from the local actors involved in these clashes,’’ he said.
