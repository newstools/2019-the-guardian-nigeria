Ghanaian film star, Yvonne Nelson is making it clear about the underdevelopment of her beloved country, Ghana. The multiple award-winning actress and mother of one took to her Twitter page to lament the lack of development in Ghana since the country attained her independence in 1957. According to her, the people need to sit out an election as a form of protest as having a KFC in an area does not translate as the environment progressing or developing. Check out her tweets below: “I am waiting for the day no one goes out to VOTE!!!!!! Just to send a strong message across! Because it’s been the same from 1957 to me!!!! Cape Coast, Takoradi, Accra high street look same and even worse in some places, Don’t think seeing a KFC is a development.” “As for cape coast eeh, my heart breaks when I go there! The capital of the gold coast!!! Where tourists troop to, we should be ashamed paa. We need to stop spending so much money on these celebrations! They are pointless! The money can be used for development!” Just recently, Nelson issued a warning to those writing and saying negative things about her daughter. According to her, while she as an adult may be able to ignore the things said about her, she won’t stand for anybody coming after her daughter. She also threatened to slam any offender with a lawsuit.
