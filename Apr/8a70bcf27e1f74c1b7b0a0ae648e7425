• My ambition intact, Ndume insists
The North Central Alliance for Danjuma Goje and North East Consultative Forum (NESF) as well as five other groups in the geopolitical zone have endorsed the former Gombe State governor for the senate presidency of the Ninth Assembly. At a news conference yesterday in Kaduna, the chairman of the support group, Comrade Nasiru Isiyaku, submitted that the ranking legislator had demonstrated to his constituents that providing good governance was not rocket science. The organisation hinted that it had perfected a 2000-man march on the National Assembly to bring the crusade into fruition.Rising from an emergency meeting Wednesday night in Bauchi, the other associations, including North East Elders Mobilisation Forum, APC National Youth Caucus, Borno Discussion Circle, Gombe Political Associations and North East Youth Awareness for Good Governance, urged Goje to immediately declare for the position. The conveners, Mustapha Saidu and Alhaji Bello Ambo, subsequently communicated Goje’s endorsement to the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. Describing the two-term ex-governor as the candidate of the region, they charged the party chair to immediately review his stance on Senator Ahmed Lawan, whom he had recommended for the seat. Similarly, former Senate Leader and contender, Ali Ndume, has dismissed as untrue insinuations that he turned down Vice President Yemi Osinbajo’s overtures.In a statement in Abuja, the Borno legislator pointed out that President Muhammadu Buhari was not against his ambition. He said his recent visit to Osinbajo was on the humanitarian issues in the North East, especially the welfare of the internally displaced persons (IDPs), which Ndume added, were dear to the nation’s number two citizen.
