The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) yesterday expressed dissatisfaction over what it termed  ‘poor implementation’ of the cleanup in the area, demanding an immediate provision of water.It also urged the Federal Government to conduct a comprehensive health audit on the people as well as establish an integrated soil management centre in the oil-rich community. A communiqué issued by MOSOP president, Fegalo Nsuke, decried attempts by the government to “force oil production in Ogoniland without the consent of the people.”He maintained that exploratory and exploitative activities could only resume after a dialogue involving all stakeholders. The congress also demanded the creation of Bori State as a start to the negotiation of oil resumption in the area, pointing out the “disturbing and alarming rate of insecurity in Ogoniland.”It therefore passed a vote of confidence in its leadership and called on the public to disregard any speculation of power tussle within the group.
