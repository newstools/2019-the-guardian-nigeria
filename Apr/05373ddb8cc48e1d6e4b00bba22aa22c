The next Transformers film will not be a followup to The Last Knight, and director Michael Bay has no plans to return to the franchise. The film hit a financial speed bump when The Last Knight was released in the summer of 2017; it was also greeted with the franchise’s usual negative reviews, and the box office disappointment indicated it was time for a new direction for the Autobots and Decepticons. That new direction came in the guise of Bumblebee, director Travis Knight’s soft reboot of the franchise. While Bumblebee was not a major hit in the box office, it still got rave reviews from critics and audiences alike and seemed a natural starting point for a new iteration of the story. But producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura seemingly threw some uncertainty on the franchise’s future, recently commenting that the studio had several different ideas for the next entry in series, possibly even one that follows the events of Transformers: The Last Knight. In a new interview with Slash Film, di Bonaventura clarifies that the next Transformers film will not be connected to Bay’s quintet of movies, and further stresses that Bay has left the franchise behind. Furthermore, there’s also an animated film set on Cybertron in development, and even the idea of a Beast Wars film has been discussed. There are plenty of possibilities on the horizon for the Transformers, but it seems the days of Bay’s robotic fantasies are officially behind us.
