Popular Nollywood actress, Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde who recently described Nigerian as hellish under President Muhammadu Buhari and his vice, Yemi Osinbajo have been accused of labeling the country so because she’s not receiving free money from politicians. The actress in her post had also tweeted about how money is no longer circulating but in his response to her, Bashir Ahmad, an assistant to President Buhari fired back writing, “Madam Omotola those who are working for CLEAN money are not complaining and will never refer our dear country as ‘hellish’. In Kano State alone, from 2015 to 2018, no fewer than 200 medium and small scale rice milling centres emerged. For that, billions circulated among millions.” Some other social media users also slammed the actress asking her to open up on her non-partisan criticism. The screen star was quick to shut down the allegations of collecting money and asked her accusers to carry out their research and also think deeply before typing or risk getting blocked. She went on to say that she criticised the past administration more than she has criticised the current. She concluded her post by saying that she is an activist who doesn’t play partisan politics and she is clean with her conscience. Omotola has been vocal in her criticism of the state of Nigeria as she recently called Nigerian youths morally bankrupt and also urged Nigerians to fight for their rights.
