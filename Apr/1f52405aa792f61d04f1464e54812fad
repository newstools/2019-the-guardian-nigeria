Ahead 2019 gubernatorial poll in Bayelsa State, Bayelsans Arise for Good Governance (BAGG) has begun to mobilise support for the Minister of State for Agriculture and Rural Development, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri, as the next governor. The groupâ€™s endorsement of Lokpobiri, a former Speaker of Bayelsa State House of Assembly, a two-time Senator and a current minister, came just as the race for November 2019 governorship poll begins to gather momentum. The BAGG, in a statement, yesterday, by its spokesman, Mr. Sufadoh Sufadoh, said the minister, with his antecedents and political pedigree, was better positioned to promote good governance and deliver democracy dividends. He said Lokpobiri, who is a possible All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant, is a grassroots politician, whose knack for excellence and sincere service was devoid of pecuniary gains, but to move the state to the next level of development. Sufadoh said the ruling APC at the centre needed a very strong standard bearer that is rational and decisive enough to check alleged excesses of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state.
