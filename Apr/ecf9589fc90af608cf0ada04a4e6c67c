 [FILE PHOTO] NCC Boss, Umar Garba Danbatta  Speaking while delivering a goodwill message at an investment summit of Kaduna State Government, KADINVEST 4.0, Prof Danbatta, expressed optimism about the commitment of the agency toward taking the broadband penetration to the next level. “When I was appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015, broadband penetration was only 8.5 per cent, it has now risen to 33%, an equivalent of 63 million Nigerians enjoying the services. “I am particularly thrilled to see that the rising trend has not only been sustained, but the NCC is now ready to take it to the next level,” he emphasized. It could be recalled that Nigeria attained its 30% broadband target in 2018 through measures and strategies put in place by the NCC under the leadership of Prof Danbatta, a development that has attracted industry-wide commendations. Speaking further at the occasion, however, Danbatta also urged Fleek Network Limited, the licensed Infraco for the North West to quickly mobilise to site with a view to deploying broadband infrastructure in the region. At least, 6 infrastructure companies (Infracos) have been licensed by the NCC under the leadership of Prof Danbatta, to drive the deployment of broadband infrastructure across the nation’s geopolitical zones and Lagos State, which is a zone on its own due to the sheer size of its market. The license for the north central region remaining is currently being processed.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
