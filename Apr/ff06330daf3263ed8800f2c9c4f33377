Justin Bieber rarely weighs in when it comes to political commentary, but he decided to speak up Thursday when Fox News host Laura Ingraham made “disgusting comments” mocking Nipsey Hussle after his fatal shooting. “Laura Ingraham absolutely disgusting what you did on national television,” Bieber wrote, in defense of Nipsey. “How dare you laugh in the face of a person who has passed on. Doesn’t matter who it is. But disrespecting someone who was a pillar in the community and did right by people?” The outraged pop star went on to call for Ingraham to be fired from her position at Fox News. “Did you not think about the family who just lost a love[d] one and now have to see you mock him on national television. It’s absurd and you should be fired period,” he declared. The cringe-worthy segment finds Ingraham turning Hussle’s death into a laughing matter, when she glosses over his career accolades and life story to wrongly point out YG’s “FDT” as Nipsey’s song, when he’s actually just featured on the Donald Trump diss track. She then jokingly calls the song “a very creative refrain,” as Ingraham and her co-host share a chuckle. Bieber joins T.I. and The Game, who started petitioning for Ingraham to lose her job earlier in the week.   Laura Ingraham  absolutely disgusting what you did on national television. How dare you laugh in the face of a person who has passed on. Doesn’t matter who it is. But disrespecting someone’s who was a pillar in the community and did right by people? Did you not think about the family who just lost a love one and now have to see you mock him on national television It’s absurd and you should be fired period. #repost #spreadawareness A post shared by  Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Apr 18, 2019 at 10:22am PDT
