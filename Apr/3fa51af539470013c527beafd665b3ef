“Uyo Meyo” hitmaker, Teni the Entertainer has disclosed that her primary focus is her music and she is placing it above any romantic relationship for now. The music rave of the moment, however, admitted that she would consider raising a family of her own in future. She said, “For now, music is my primary focus. Of course, at some point in the future, I will like to have a family of my own but for now, I am in a relationship with my music. I have a very wide taste in music; so, I listen to all sorts and that influences me in different ways.” On how she managed to rise so fast in the music industry, Teni said, “To be honest with you, I am amazed by how far I have come in a short while but I can also assure you that you have not seen anything yet. I still have a lot in stock. As a matter of fact, I have barely started. I am usually overjoyed when I see people singing my songs word for word with so much passion. I love to make people happy and I have been able to do that with my music. I have very big dreams as far as my career is concerned and I can only tell you to keep your fingers crossed.”
