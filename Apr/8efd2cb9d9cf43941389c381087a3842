 National Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Chief  Victor Oye  The youths noted that APGA had grown beyond being a state party, thus a national chairman outside Anambra would serve the party better. In a statement after their meeting in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, the national president, Okechukwu Isiguzoro, said that such action was capable of destroying the party built as a third force in Nigeria’s politics. According to him, the party needs to be restructured to have a national outlook. Isiguzoro’s comments were against a report credited to Oye that the national leadership of the party would remain in Anambra after his tenure. He pleaded with Governor Willie Obiano not to allow the party to sink. “The leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council worldwide frowns at the report credited to the national chairman of APGA, Dr. Victor Oye, that the national leadership of the party would remain in Anambra after his tenure as very unfortunate and capable of destroying a party built as a third force in Nigeria. “The current proclamation of Oye is at variance with the party’s slogan, ‘Be my Brother’s Keeper’, which Oye conspired with his co-travellers to harm. Does it truly mean that this party is now the sole property of Anambra people? “Does it mean that other Igbo people and Nigerians who had paid the price to build APGA are now slaves to Anambra State? This ugly trend must be resisted, as we call on the Board of Trustees (BOT) chairman, Governor Willie Obiano, to use his good offices to thwart this evil plot or APGA is at the edge of political extinction.” The group called for immediate restructuring of APGA or risk losing Anambra in 2021. “We will raise the consciousness of Nigerians and Ndigbo that there’s evil conspiracy in APGA to use it to defraud Nigerians as witnessed in the last elections,” it added.
