Yaoota Considering the fact that you are likely to be engaged with multiples activities the whole day and also factoring in the enormous heatwave that has become the order of the day, light fabrics like Batiste, Chiffon or Cotton Voile are highly recommended because they allow for maximum comfort and still give you a rather stylish chic look.

In times like this, most ladies can attest to how uncomfortable heels can get after a couple of minutes talk less of a whole day. To avoid dreading your Easter Sunday which is ideally a day of celebration, you need to put on your metaphoric dancing shoes which could be loafers, wedges or flats but definitely not heels. The general view for this Easter Sunday look is more of comfortable chic so when selecting your handbag, you should opt for the less humongous ones because they would compliment your look much better and it would definitely be easier to move a smaller purse, a baguette bag or wristlet around with you as opposed to bigger bags which after a while will seem tedious.

Shopify Having the right pair of sunglasses is a double win because not only does it further elevate your style game, it also protects you from the harsh rays of the sun which we can all agree has been rather extreme recently. A nice comfortable pair of shades would do just fine but the best sunglasses also protect you from harmful UV rays so it is advisable to invest in having the right ones for optimal results and the safety of your eyes. Ray Bans and Aviator shades do a pretty good job at keeping you chic and safe. Lady in a sun hat. Photo. Essence This season, hats are totally in vogue and even more so with the sunny weather.
