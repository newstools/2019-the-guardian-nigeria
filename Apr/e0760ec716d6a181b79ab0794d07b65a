An eyewitness, Clement Edet, who informed the police, said the suspect took his two children, a boy and a girl to Murray Street to look for a rich buyer. He said Inyang asked for a particular rich man living in that street to sell the children to him. Edet said they were surprised by what the man said and to stop him from taking the children elsewhere to sell they had to delay him while making efforts to contact the police at Atakpa Police Station. The police came immediately and whisked him away. According to the source, “he said he was looking for someone to buy his two children, that the male child is N200,000 and the female child 150,000.” The Divisional Police Officer, Atapka police station, confirmed the arrest. He said the matter has been transferred to the State Criminal Division at the police command headquarters for further investigations. As at the time of filing the report, the Cross River State police spokesperson, DSP Irene Ugbo, said she has not been briefed on the matter. It would be recalled that the Imo State police command at the weekend paraded one Mrs. Chinonye Oparaocha, aged 23, alongside other suspects for allegedly selling her six hours old baby boy to the tune of N850,000, shortly after delivery at a hospital along Nekede road in Owerri West Local Government Area. The Imo State Police Public Relation Officer, PPRO, Orlando Ikeokwu, told newsmen the baby was sold by one said to be a nurse, Confidence Anyanwu, 28-year-old female, who facilitated the shady deal. He added that Confidence, together with her husband, Amaeze Anyanwu, who is said to be at large conspired to sell the child. Other suspects identified as members of the child trafficking syndicate included Mr. Duru Christain, aged 38; Mrs. George Iyowuna, aged 38; and Mrs. William Cynthia, aged 44. According to the police, Duru in company with Iyowuna collected the baby from the nurse, Confidence, and handed the child to the buyer, Mrs. Cynthia, at Port Harcourt, who paid them N850,000.
