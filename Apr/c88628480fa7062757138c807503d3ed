Coachella was not expecting the fresh prince, Will Smith, but he showed up anyway. On Friday night, Jaden Smith was joined in the Sahara tent by his father for a performance of “Icon” — as Instagrammed by Smith. The crowd was sent into a frezy when Smith hopped on stage; the footage of Will Smith rapping was shot by Jaden, who turns his smartphone camera around just long enough to photobomb his father’s cameo. “Done did dat! #Coachella,” wrote Smith on Instagram.

Apparently, the festival can only handle so much Smithiness at one time.
