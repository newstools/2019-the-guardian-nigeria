Wendy Williams returned from her weeklong vacation on Monday to host her daytime talk show live and she isin no mood for trolls. Williams — who recently announced she’s living in a sober house — revealed she went camping over the weekend in upstate New York and addressed reports that she was looking “frail” in recently-surfaced photos. “The great thing about being in the sober house [are] the people that I live with,” she said. “We are people with functioning careers who just want to check ourselves and get down with that 12-step…” “There’s such a stigma to substance abuse. Everyone thinks it’s going to be the bum on the corner,” she continued. “I’m the face of it. How about you? Sometimes you just need to go someplace and get atone with your sobriety and your 12 steps.” After revealing a photo of herself riding a scooter at the local Walmart that made the tabloid rounds, Williams explained the backstory and slammed reports that she was “by herself” and looking “frail.” “I want to shout-out to my friends at the Walmart in a little-known place called Ellen, New York,” she said. “We went up there and the Walmart is the social place. When I’m away from the show, sometimes I do take selfies. At 4 o’clock in the morning, I’m sitting in this scooter … taking pictures with people.” “This became a blog sensation over the weekend, so I’m here to correct,” she continued. “One of the best things about being truthful to yourself and having your own show is that I can come and dispel my own rumours.”  Williams joked that while the trip was fun, she’ll “never do it again.” “Thank you, Ellen, New York, and thank you blogs. Do I look frail to you?” she asked the studio audience. “I do the Hot Topics, I am the Hot Topic. It’s fabulous.”
