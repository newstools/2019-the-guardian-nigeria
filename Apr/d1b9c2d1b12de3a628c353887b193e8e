One of the biggest Game of Thrones questions has finally been answered as writer Dave Hill has explained what the white walkers’ symbol represents. The writer who penned the Season 8 premiere “Winterfell” shared the significance of one of the show’s prominent symbols: the White Walkers’ spiral pattern. Speaking to the post, Hill said; “As we saw with Bran and the Three-Eyed Raven, the spiral pattern was sacred to the Children of the Forest, who created the Night King by sacrificing a captured man in a spiral ‘henge of stones.’ The Night King then adopted the symbol as a sort of blasphemy, like Satan with the upside-down cross.” The symbol first appeared in the series’ pilot episode, when Night’s Watch rangers traveled beyond the Wall and found an encampment of dead people, whose bodies were organized into a rhombus with a line running through it. The spiral then appeared again, formed from dead horse parts. The spiral becomes more important when Bran Stark witnesses the making of the Night King by the Children of the Forest at the center of a spiral, signifying that the threat of the Dead was conceived by the Children in their fight against the First Men.
