To boost its working capital, Nigerian Breweries said it will close its N15billion commercial paper programme this week, which it opened last Thursday, in a bid to support its short-term funding requirements.

Nigeria Breweries is not alone in the brewery downturn, as International Breweries (IB) Plc, the Nigerian unit of Belgian brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev), reported ₦2.2billion in net loss for Q1 2018 ended March.
 
The brewer blamed the loss on rising costs including skyrocketing foreign exchange (FX) loss, which grew by 310 per cent to ₦158 million. Administrative expenses and net finance cost rose by 300 and 367 per cent respectively to ₦6.3billion and ₦3.6billion. Cost of sales also grew 227 per cent to ₦16.8billion, driven partly by FX and the FX impact on financing cost, which led to the record ₦2.2billion loss.
 
Despite the loss, IB Plc said sales grew by 175 per cent to ₦25.9billion from ₦9.4billion a year ago, fuelled by a 272 per cent increase in marketing and promotional expense.
 
The brewer announced in September it would be changing its financial year-end to December 31st from March 31st of every year following the merger with its sister companies – Intafact Beverages Limited, and Pabod Breweries Limited. While the April – June 2017 accounts for only one company (IB Plc), the quarter under review is for the merged companies (January – March 2018).
