The recent massacre in a Mosque at Christchurch city, New Zealand by a young man filled up with hate crime is another tragedy of a dysfunctional family defined by hate. The sociopathic mind killed 49 people with more people in the hospital with serious gunshot wounds. It was another serious heinous crime against humanity. The ugly happenings in this ides of March have inspired me to work on a mused poem for publication. The month of March, 2019 has consumed the best and the muses around us. Some of these quintessential people died of natural deaths; some were expunged from us by the mishaps of man-made disasters; and some were killed by the hateful mind. But some deaths are not by happenstance. Natural death is inevitable, but heinous crimes that result in the quantum death of people through hate and resentment are avoidable deaths. We must engage in positive preachment to change the minds of haters. Retrospectively, the mindfulness of the ugly events in this March, 2019 is the loveable lives the victims lived before they were snatched away from us and humankind. Haters are a product of their existential and dreadful lives. We live in a borrowed world, and we shall leave it with a continuum sigh of history. The good or evil things people do will live after them. The world is in dire need of pacesetters to reconstruct the nuances of hate in their lives to love. There is too much hate everywhere! Even in your closed environment, you have friendenemies, coworkers, schoolmates, and associates etc that are surreptitiously vindictive but pretend to love you. They’re product of hateful beginnings. We must constantly put these evil-minded people in our close circuits as code yellow or red (i.e be vigilant of their pseudo-love and pretenses). We must not fall into the trap of pretentious people. It is high time we began the reconstruction of minds through love by planting unconditional love in our children. The minds of children are like the process of pollination; hate or love is carried from parents (anther) to the children’s mind (stigma) Once this cross-fertilization completes it cycle, hate is pollinated, the stigmatization festers into the society, the results of which are dangerous to the global world. We are seeing the manifestation of hate induced conundrums in our society today. Love conquers hate; and hate destroys its agents or carriers (sociopath people) and the good people around the carriers of hate. Let’s catch the children young because they will eventually become the products of our good or misdemeanors, deeds and misdeeds. In retrospect, on my birthday last year, I got a birthday message from my son, and the message blew my mind. The message reads: “I learn more moral lessons from your behavior more than what you morally tell me every day.” The message has remained a guidance and indelible referential mark in my subconscious mind. Good children are the salt of the world and catalyst for good transformation. When hater begins to get scared of himself, if he is not checked and tamed, the society he lives will be in trouble and burdensome of his antisocial behavior. He will be in constant state of negative thought process and self-hate to consuming himself and the lives of other people in his vicinity. Hater lives in a state of denial and evil ideation. The mind of haters is constructed not to create but to destroy. We must strive hard towards promoting prosocial lifestyle and positive behavior through our interactions with children. We must teach our children to imbibe the spirit of love, compassion and brotherhood for the collective and common good of humanity.
Love and Peace endure!
