 TB Joshua  The District Superintendent, West and Central Africa, Rev. Emmanuel Adeniran, said the significance of Easter is gradually losing its value due to the commercialization of the holiday, while the essence of the season, Jesus Christ, is relegated to the background. The Special Adviser on Media to the President, Femi Adesina, who was a guest at the event, said the message of Easter is a message of victory over darkness and death, and “the lesson we can learn from this is that whatever problem is besetting this country, killings, economic problems, social problems can all be overcome. Just as Jesus overcame death, Nigeria will surely overcome all her troubles. Nigeria will resurrect as Jesus resurrected,” he said. In another event, the founder of The Synagogue Church of All Nations, Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua, has called on Nigerians to eschew the spirit of fear and believe in God for their future and the future of Nigeria. In his ministration on Easter Sunday, the cleric advised people against imbibing the spirit of fear, which according to him always come from the enemy, Satan, who only came to steal, kill and destroy. He urged Nigerians to emulate Jesus Christ, who despised the spirit of fear, faced the suffering of the cross with courage. “Fear would definitely come and it is natural but yielding to the spirit of fear is what people should guide against.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
