 [File] Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai  While defending the 2019 budget proposal of the military before the House of Representatives Committee on Army yesterday, he urged them to exempt the army from the existing budget ceiling or envelope allocation system.He based his submission on the on-going structural changes, volatile security environment and massive engagement of troops in virtually all the 36 states of the federation.
