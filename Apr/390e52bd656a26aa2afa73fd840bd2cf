 Mobil  However, the court, presided by Justice Fatun Riman, on January 25, 2018, struck out Mobil’s objection, prompting the oil major to file an appeal. In the appeal, Mobil through Mr. Charles Nwabulu and Mr. Ituah Imhanze of Kenna Partners, submitted that its right to fair hearing had been breached by reason of the failure of the respondent to provide the particulars of damage done to his community by the oil spill.
  
The respondent, represented by Eugene O. Odey, however, urged the court to dismiss the appeal. But in its judgment, delivered by Justice Yargata Nimparon, the appellate court upheld Mobil’s appeal and resolved all the issues raised in Mobil’s favour. The Court agreed with Mobil that its right to fair hearing was breached at the Federal High Court by virtue of the Respondent’s failure to provide the particulars of damage done to his community by the alleged oil spill.
