Céline Dion will be hitting the road soon for her Courage Tour and for the very first time, her kids won’t be going along with her. The 51-year-old vocal powerhouse, announced Wednesday during A Special Event with Céline Dion in Los Angeles that the tour kicks off Sept. 18 in Quebec City, Canada. (The accompanying album will be available “around November,” she shared.) “My kids will be based in Las Vegas,” Dion said during a Q&A session of the city where she’s currently performing in the final shows of her longtime residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace, which wraps June 8. “I’m going to do the world tour but back and forth — I’ll come home as much as possible.” “That’s going to be the first time that I’m not going on tour with my kids,” she added of her twin sons Eddy and Nelson, 8, and their older brother René-Charles, 18, whom she shared with late husband René Angélil.
