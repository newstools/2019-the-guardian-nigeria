The woman killed during the recent attack on Kajuru Castle has been named by the British high commission as Faye Mooney. The 29-year-old British aid worker was killed by kidnappers along with a Nigerian during Friday evening’s attack in which three other people were abducted, Kaduna police and the British high commission said. Mercy Corps, the non-governmental aid agency Mooney worked for, paid tribute to her. “Faye was a dedicated, passionate communication and learning specialist,” said chief executive Neal Keny-Guyer in a statement posted on social media, adding that colleagues were “utterly heartbroken”. Mooney had “worked with Mercy Corps for almost two years. Her family, in an interview with The Guardian (UK), said she was a bright and intelligent woman with a “deep love for life and people” who had never been happier. “She was on holiday with her boyfriend Matthew Oguche,” they said. “Faye was an inspiration to her family, friends, students and work colleagues. Her bravery and her belief in a better society took her to places others feared. Faye did what she wanted; nothing held her back. “Permanently against the grain, Faye was unconventional to the core. Her family and friends are so proud of who she was and of everything she achieved in her short but purposeful life. Her memory will always be cherished.” Kaduna state police said the kidnappers attacked the resort with guns. “Some suspected kidnappers armed with dangerous weapons gained entry into a recreational resort called Kajuru Castle, shooting sporadically and in the process shot dead two persons, including an expatriate lady, and took away three others,” a Kaduna state police spokesman said, without naming the other person killed.
