Award-winning Nollywood actress and mom of four, Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde has stated that Nigerians need to fight for their rights with some kind of revolution in order for things to get better in the country. The versatile actress who has gained both local and international prominence aired her views during a Twitter question and answer session. During the session, she also appealed to the government to declare a state of emergency in places affected by violence. She said, “I am appealing to the government to immediately see to the rising rate of depression, suicide, police brutality, ritual killings and general lack of safety in the Country. It’s at an all-time high now, there should be a state of emergency declared.” On why she did not openly support any presidential candidate in the last election, she opined. “Excuses won’t move us forward. We must be angry enough and divert our anger towards looking for real change. We need to know the use of political offices, ask questions and engage the leaders. “I hope soon we birth a Jerry Rawlins or something of that kind. We do need a revolution. Nigeria is too big and important for it to implode. However, there are still honest people. Don’t be discouraged.” The actress who also has what is considered one of the most successful marriages for an entertainer having been married for over twenty years also dished advice to people on how to choose a life partner. On relationships, she said, “A lot lies on your choice of a spouse. Are they understanding, mature minded and supportive? Your spouse needs to be your career partner, knowing it’s both of you against the world. If not, it’s a rocky ride ahead. However, don’t compromise your career, it’s your sanity.” Earlier in the week, Jalade celebrated one of her daughters by making her a woman crush and also showering her with praises.
