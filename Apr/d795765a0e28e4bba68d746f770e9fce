While men in Papua New Guinea are turning to Do-It-Yourself (DIY) penis enlargement, Brazil’s president has expressed shock at the exact opposite. President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro has was dismayed after learning that over 1,000 penis amputations are done annually and a part of the cause is linked to hygiene. According to the president who described it as “ridiculous and sad,” he told reporters that his government must go back to reeducating men on the dangers of poor hygiene. “In Brazil, we have 1,000 penis amputations a year due to a lack of water and soap,” he said. “We have to find a way to get out of the bottom of this hole.” Other factors that led to the amputations include complications from HIV, cancers and untreatable infections. Meanwhile, in Papua Guinea, doctors have reported over 500 cases in one hospital alone where cooking oil, coconut oil and silicone have been injected into their genitalia. Akule Danlop of Port Moresby General Hospital, who is the only doctor who can treat this problem told The Guardian UK that the “nationwide problem” is a sort of hype that male nurses have promised will help “increase the length and the girth of it to enhance their sexual experience with their partner,” he said.
