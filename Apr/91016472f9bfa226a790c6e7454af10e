Netflix has caught the eyes of various television visionaries like Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy, with deals worth $100 million and $250 million, respectively, and top comedians like Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle ($40 million and $60 million, respectively). The streaming giant, which recently announced it’s added nearly 10 million subscribers in the first quarter of 2019, is spreading its tentacles and honing in on music, too, landing a three-project deal with Beyonce worth a whopping $60 million, Variety reports. The first of the three specials is Beyonce’s  “Homecoming,” the behind-the-scenes documentary chronicling her 2018 Coachella performance —  a massive spectacle of dance, visuals and music — which premiered on April 17. With the release of “Homecoming,” Beyonce also surprise-dropped a 40-track accompanying album that includes two bonus cuts near the end: “Before I Let Go” and “I Been On.” The former is a cover of a Frankie Beverly & Maze classic featured in the documentary’s closing credits, while the latter is an updated version of a song that was uploaded to SoundCloud back in 2013. Netflix’s previous forays into exclusive music content include last year’s “Springsteen on Broadway” special, Lady Gaga’s “Gaga: Five Foot Two,” released in 2017, the Quincy Jones doc “Quincy” and the critically lauded series “Remastered.”
