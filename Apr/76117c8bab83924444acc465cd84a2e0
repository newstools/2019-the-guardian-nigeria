Jennifer Lopez’s style keeps evolving and it is evident in all her red carpet looks; this is worthy of appreciation. The Council for Fashion Designers of America(CFDA) on Tuesday announced that they will award the 2019 Fashion Icon Award to Jennifer Lopez. “Jennifer Lopez uses clothes as a way to express confidence and power,” CFDA Chairwoman Diane von Furstenberg said in the announcement. “Both designers and fans look forward to her fashion statements.” The event, considered to be the “Oscars of fashion,” honours both American fashion designers and celebrities who wear their clothes. While nearly every outfit Lopez has worn in music videos, while filming her upcoming movie “Hustlers” and off-stage embodies the New York City glamour she’s become known for, her most famous gown — the now-iconic green Versace dress worn to the 2000 Grammy’s — was so wildly and instantly popular that it inspired Google to create its images search page. Naomi Campbell, Beyoncé Knowles, Pharrell Williams and Rihanna have all received the Fashion Icon award in the past and, in 2018, the CFDA created a new category — the Influencer Award — for Kim Kardashian. The award ceremony will take place on June 3 at the Brooklyn Museum.
