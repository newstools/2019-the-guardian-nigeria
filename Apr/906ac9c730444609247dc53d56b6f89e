The call was made by the Managing Director, Cosmic Insurance Brokers, Dr. Teslim Sanusi, when he paid a congratulatory visit to Sanwoolu in Lagos, over the weekend. Sanusi, advised the in-coming leader on the need to encourage the insurance of public and government assets to reduce or eliminate the menace of collapsed buildings in the state and the associated costs.
 
Lamenting the spate of collapsed buildings with its attendant effect on the people of the state, Sanusi advised the state government to continually undertake surveys and risk audits of public buildings in the state through recommendations from professionals, and ensure that insurance companies insisted on such risk improvement reports before accepting such risks.
 
Sanusi, who was a former President of the Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers, also commiserated with the government over the loss of lives occasioned by the collapse of a public building at Ita Faaji on Lagos Island and appealed to the public to always embrace insurance in order to cushion losses to lives and property in the event of their occurrence.
