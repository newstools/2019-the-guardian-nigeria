This is why the association will not relent in organising more competitions and training to promote Karate in Lagos. “There is need to keep creating awareness of Karate. The programme yielded positive results, as we are able to discover more talents and enlighten the kids more on Karate. “We believe the turn out will be better next year as Nigeria need to be at the world map of Karate in the nearest future based on the talents in the country,” he said.
