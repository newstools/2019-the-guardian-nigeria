Kaduna State governor Nasir El-Rufai PHOTO: TWITTER/GOVERNOR KADUNA Chairman of Kaduna State Peace Commission, Rev. Josiah Idowu-Fearon, has said that the commission was in talks with Governor Nasir el-Rufai on the release of Adara community leaders in detention. Rev. Idowu-Fearon, at a press briefing in Kaduna, said he and the vice chairperson of the commission had an audience with the governor, where he was briefed on the community’s request, particularly the release of their leaders. According to him, the governor said the police detained them; that he could intervene only when they were properly arraigned. His words: “I want to seize this opportunity to tell our brothers and sisters in the community that at least we have spoken with His Excellency. We are believing that the police will quickly present the case, so that His Excellency will intervene.” The cleric also assured that the crisis in the council would soon be curtailed. Describing the recurring violent confrontations in Kajuru Council as worrisome, Idowu-Fearon said he chaired a stakeholders’ meeting at the council’s secretariat on April 15 and was pleased with the commitment to peace shown by the residents. The council and communities, he added, had already constituted a peace and reconciliation committee to address the conflict. “The Kaduna State Peace Commission has assured the communities of its commitment to support them in the process, until lasting peace is attained. “The challenges of insecurity in many parts of the state are quite worrisome. This is most prevalent in Birnin-Gwari Council as well as many parts of Chikun, Giwa, Igabi, Kachia, Kajuru, Kagarko and Kauru councils. “We appeal to the people of the state, as well as security agencies, to join hands to address this unfortunate situation of armed robbery, raiding of villages, kidnapping, cattle rustling and other forms of rural crimes,” he said.
