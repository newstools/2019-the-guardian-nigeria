Farmgate Africa is partnering Livestock247.com, an online Livestock Market to bring buyers, sellers, ranchers/feedlot operators, veterinary professionals, haulage companies, butcheries/abattoirs, and financial service providers together. The partnership between Livestock247.com, Farmgate Africa and the Farmcrowdy Group, according to a statment by the agro-commodity aggregator platform, will deepen the offerings in the agricultural space in terms of proper organisation and profitable deployment of funds to key areas of production and trading. The partnership, according to a statment by the agro-commodity aggregator platform, will pilot the first ever cattle feedlot in Adamawa State, noting that the first phase has been quite successful and “this sees the businesses scaling production to over 24,000 bulls with about 1,200 feedlot clusters in the North East, North West and Southern parts of Nigeria operating through feedlot systems at the production end. On the trading end, Farmgate Africa has anchored the relationship that sees Livestock247.com trading in excess of 20,000 bulls in over 10 abattoirs in Lagos for FY2019 alone.”Co-founder and CEO of Livestock247.com, Ibrahim Maigari Ahmadu, said Lagos slaughters over 6,000 cows a day, being the largest consuming livestock market in sub-Saharan Africa. He said: “Our target is to produce in excess of 24,000 bulls through 1,200 feedlot clusters in the next one year. Livestock247.com provides a platform for buyers of livestock to purchase traceable and fit for slaughter livestock from anywhere and at any time without inconveniences. “The platform also gives sellers of livestock a borderless reach and access to market 24/7. In addition, it gives Veterinary professionals access to livestock owners for disease surveillance and epidemiology and provides financial service providers with an opportunity to fund investments in the livestock sector.” Speaking on how the partnership will strengthen Farmgate Africa’s plans to grow the market-access for farmers and buyers, Co-Founder & Managing Director, Farmgate Africa, Kenneth Obiajulu, said: “Our goal has always been to collaborate with relevant partners in the agribusiness space to deliver value for both smallholder farmers and major processors/buyers. Our vision is a shared one with Livestock247.com, and this sees us developing the marketing together both from a production and marketing point.” The Group CEO of Farmcrowdy Group, Onyeka Akumah said: “We can’t build an entire ecosystem for Agriculture in Nigeria alone. We have our strengths when we are building solutions with technology, but to build an ecosystem requires strong partnerships with stakeholders who are experts in their domain. So, this is the reason why a partnership with Livestock 247 is exciting for the entire Farmcrowdy Group and specifically for Farmgate Africa-our Aggregator Platform for Agro-commodities.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
