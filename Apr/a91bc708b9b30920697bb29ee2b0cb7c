President Muhammadu Buhari has inaugurated the newly constructed building of the Institute of Maternal And Child Health also known as Ayinke House located at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital in Ikeja. The building which is the biggest maternity hospital in Nigeria was upgraded from 80-bed facility to 170-bed healthcare centre. The president was followed by ministers and special advisers. Other dignitaries include Governors of Ogun (Ibikunle Amosu ), Oyo (Abiola Ajimobi), Ondo (Oluwarotimi Akeredolu), Ekiti (Kayode Fayemi), Adamawa (Jubrila Bindow); the deputy governor of Edo State, Philip Shaibu; Lagos State Governor-Elect, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu and his deputy, Dr Obafemi Hamzat; Oba  of Lagos, Rilwan Akiolu, among others Governor of Lagos state,  Akinwunmi Ambode, described this development as a historic development. He added that the maternity home would provide the best service for childbearing. The governor recalled how the facility was commissioned 29 years ago, with the late businessman and philanthropist, Mobolaji Bank-Anthony. Bank-Anthony dedicated the maternal and child care facility to the State Government, in memory of his mother, and thus gave the name  “Ayinke House”. Ambode stated that the hospital has become the first choice for expectant mothers. Considering the overstretched state of the building, and the need to uphold the memory of Bank-Anthony, former governor of Lagos State Babatunde Fashola awarded the contract for the expansion of the facility. “Today, seven years after the closure of the facility, the new edifice is now a 170-bed facility with 5 surgical theatres. It has a 16-bed emergency care unit with 3 organ support facilities, 30-bed special baby care unit, 5 neonatal intensive care units, a fully equipped laboratory with support services, laboratories, and a blood bank”. Ambode said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
