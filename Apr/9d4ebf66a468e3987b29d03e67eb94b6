50-year-old music mogul, Bryan Williams better known by his stage name Birdman has disclosed that he is looking for a new look. The rap star made this known during an appearance on the “Wendy Williams Show” when he said that he is interested in removing the tattoos on his face. The Cash Money co-founder has at least 17 tattoos on his face, ranging from teardrops and a music note to a cross at the center of his forehead. He said, “I didn’t want to take the [head tattoos] off, but I want to take the facials off,” Birdman said. “And I was asking my partner, 50 [Cent]… ’cause he removed his tattoos. So I wanted to go to somebody who can take these tats off my face.” Although he wants the removals done, he’s not opposed to keeping the ink if it’s not possible. “If I have to live with it, I will. I just felt like, me being older, I would like to get it off. But if not, it is what it is.” This desire to remove his facial tattoos is a reecho of his March Forbes interview when he went into more details by saying, “I just think at this point in my life, I don’t need that. That stereotypes you,” he said. “It takes away from the business and certain things.” Elsewhere in his interview with Williams, Birdman confirmed that he and on-again, off-again girlfriend Toni Braxton are indeed back together after their engagement ended at the start of 2019. Wendy casually mentioned that Braxton isn’t too good with money – pointing to Braxton filing for bankruptcy in 1998 and 2010. And in early 2018, it was reported that she owed the IRS $780,000 in back taxes. To that, Birdman responded, “If she had and will have any problems, I have enough money where she’ll never have a problem.”
