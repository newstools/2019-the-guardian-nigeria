Drug abuse. Photo/Pixabay The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has again raised the alarm that Nigeria is sitting on a keg of gun-powder due to high rate of drug addicts across the country. The Director, Public Affairs, Dr. Abubakar Ateiza Jimoh made the disclosure in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital. He said the agency has an average conservative estimate of about 15 million people, who are on drugs and three million of them could be conveniently called addicts. This development has made the agency to conclude that the level of drug abuse has led to the high level of violence, kidnapping, terrorism, armed robbery and even dangerous driving by some drivers. He said many youths between ages 19 and 22 as well as their parents, engage in hard concoctions different from the common cocaine and heroin, which are imported into the country from other African countries.
