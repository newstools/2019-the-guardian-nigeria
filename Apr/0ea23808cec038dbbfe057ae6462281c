A lawyer for Nasser Zefzafi said he had sewn his lips together, along with a fellow jailed protester. “Detainees Nasser Zefzafi and Mohammed al-Haki have stitched their mouths in protest”, lawyer Mohammed Aghnaj said in a Facebook post.

Zefzafi was convicted on charges of threatening state security in June last year.

Authorities accused the activists of having separatist aims.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
