By the time such players are discovered, our participation in the Davis Cup is certain to be improved, and that will also enable us discover female talents for the Fed Cup, which we as a nation, has not featured,” he said. Just three players Musa Mohammed, Imeh Joseph Ubon and Sylvester Emmanuel struggled through qualifying series to the main draw of Tombim International ITF World Tennis Tour, the first leg of the three-legged M25 events. All except Emmanuel have been shown the exit. According to Akindoju, the ITF World Tennis Tour would have been an ample opportunity for the indigenous players to showcase their skills and earn ITF and ATP points without much stress, but they were not disciplined and determined to join the league of successful players; a development he said was responsible for the decision to ensure all players work hard to earn their qualification to the main draw.
