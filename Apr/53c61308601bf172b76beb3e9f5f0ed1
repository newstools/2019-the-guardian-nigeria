The suspect, who was identified as Blessing Emelor from Isoko area, was arrested on April 6, along Warri axis. According to Delta State police spokesman, Chuks Orisewezie, an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), luck ran against him on the fateful day, as he gave an order to an unsuspecting junior Air-Force personnel to shoot, which almost led to loss of life of a passer-by and the incident was reported to the appropriate authority, which eventually led to the arrest of the purported major. “It was revealed that the suspect has been involved in the act for the past three years to endear him to unsuspecting members of the public and to enjoy ‘Espirit –de-corps’ from members of the armed forces and the police. “The suspect, who had confessed to the crime has been handed over to the State Criminal Investigation Department, Asaba and would be charged to court upon conclusion of investigation. “Meanwhile, members of the public are hereby advised not to go into official transaction with the suspect, and to report any person they found impersonating either the military or the police”.
