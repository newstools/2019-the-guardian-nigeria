Nigerian superstar Burna Boy performed at the 2019 Coachella Festival on Sunday evening in California and he totally killed it! Like Eazi, who was also on the YouTube artist spotlight, Burna was backed up by a live band and a selection of male and female dancers. He made a grand entry in a yellow multicoloured, customizable Kenneth Ize trench coat and white trousers, presumably styled by his sister, Ronami Ogulu. While on stage, Burna performed a selection of smash hits which included: ‘Ye,’ ‘Dangote,’ ‘Tonight,’ ‘Killin Dem,’ ‘Soke,’On The Low,’ and others. Watch highlights below:    Burna with the moves “Killin ‘em Sha”.
