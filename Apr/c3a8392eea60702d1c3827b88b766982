We tend to look up to celebrities and their love lives and hope to have ours turn out just like theirs. Why this is so can only be tied to the fact that we are human beings and it is just a common nature to behave this way. But, from all observations, what we see on social media shared by these celebrities are just the surface of what they actually go through; relationships are not a bed of roses. Ideally, we ought to create relationship goals of our own, as realistic as possible that can help shape how our love lives should pan out. One of these many important goals you should set for your relationship is first making it a priority. At this point, you have become two and not just one; in other words, you are not just catering to the physical; emotional [and otherwise] needs of just yourself but that of another person too. Secondly, spending one-on-one time together to reconnect is another very important goal you need to set and actively make sure it is achieved. The most important element of this connection time is that you are fully present for each other. This means you aren’t looking at your phone, doing a task, or watching television. You are fully focused on each other. This is not the time to work through conflict or discuss the relationship. It is a time for talking, sharing, embracing, and simply enjoying each other’s company. Look in each other’s eyes. Hold hands. Listen attentively as the other is talking. Last, but not the least, have a fun-timetable. With work and any other thing eating up your time, infuse dinner dates, movie dates, beach outings etc, anything to spice up your relationship in an exciting way. So before you scream ‘Goals’ verbally [in the comment sections of your most stalked celebrity couple] or orally, have a look at your relationship and tick off what has been achieved so far.
