An Ile-Ife High Court in Osun State yesterday sentenced two men to life in prison for acid attack on a couple. Delivering judgment, Justice R.A. Siyanbola sentenced Kamil Folorunsho, 25 and Rilwan Abioye, 23, for pouring acid on Mr. Ismaila and Mulikat Akinlabi. Justice Siyanbola found them guilty of causing grievous harm. The prosecutors, Mrs. Ajibola Alade, the Chief State Counsel and Mr. A.O. Adeniji, the acting Solicitor-General and Permanent Secretary, Osun Ministry of Justice, told the court that the convict attacked the couple with acid on the face and the body. The prosecutors said the convict committed the offence on Dec 16, 2013 at about 2:00p.m. at Eleyele Street, Ile-Ife. They added that the offence contravened the provisions of sections 320, 324 and 332 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Osun, 2002. The Defence Counsel, Samuel Judge and Victor Egede, pleaded with the court to tamper justice with mercy. The accused were arraigned on Dec 12, 2016 and pleaded not guilty. Meanwhile, Justice Abiola Soladoye of an Ikeja Domestic Violence and Sexual Offences Court has refused the bail application of three students of the University of Lagos (UNILAG) accused of the gang rape of a fellow student. Justice Soladoye ruled yesterday that, due to the grievous nature of the offence, the court, using its discretionary powers, will deny the students bail. She also noted that there were no compelling nor exceptional circumstances provided in their applications that will warrant bail being granted to them. The students — Moboluwaji Omowole, 19; Chuka Chukwu, 19; and Peace Nwankama, 19, face three counts of defilement of a child, permitting the defilement of a child in a premises and procuration. On April 18, a co-defendant, James Aguedo, a 20-year-old student of Babcock University’s bail application was also denied by the court because he did not provide compelling circumstances to warrant bail being granted to him. The ruling on the bail application of another co-defendant, 20-year-old Josephine Osemeka, will hold on May 2. But for defiling a 14-year-old girl in another development, 50-year-old Sani Yusuf is to spend eight years in prison, a Minna Magistrate Court ruled on Monday. Yusuf is in court on a two-count charge for having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor and causing grievous hurt. Presenting the case to the Chief Magistrate, the Police Prosecutor, Sergeant Bello Mohammed, said the grandmother, Hajiya Asabe Zagi of Tudun Fulani area in Minna had reported the matter at the Bosso police station and accused Yusuf of having carnal knowledge of her 14-year-old granddaughter. According to the grandmother, Yusuf had carnal knowledge of her granddaughter on three occasions after she went to fetch water from the house where Yusuf works as a security guard. The prosecutor stated that when the complainant confronted him on the issue, Yusuf was said to have used his knife and stabbed her on her body, to which she sustained deep injuries. He noted that the offences were contrary to sections 18 (2) and 248 (2) of the Niger State Child Rights Law 2010 and the Penal Code law respectively.
