But we cannot do this unilaterally,” he told journalists following his summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un in Vladivostok. He said the weekend election, in which Volodymyr Zelensky beat incumbent Petro Poroshenko with 73 percent of the vote, showed the “complete failure” of Poroshenko’s policies. “Ukraine’s new leadership cannot fail to understand this,” he said.
