Kane, who has already injured the same ankle this season, was pictured leaving Tottenham’s new stadium on crutches after picking up the injury when going to tackle Fabian Delph early in the second half. After the 1-0 win, which puts them in pole position to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time ever, coach Mauricio Pochettino said Kane could be out for the rest of the campaign. That would be a big blow for Spurs, who are fourth in the Premier League and battling with Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United for a place in next year’s Champions League. Kane has scored 17 times in the league this season after topping the scoring charts at last summer’s World Cup in Russia. The 25-year-old could also miss England’s bid to win the Nations League.
