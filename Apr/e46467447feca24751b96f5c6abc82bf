The management of Delta Force Football Club of Asaba, Delta State has severed relationship with its Technical Adviser, Emmanuel Deutsch, following alleged poor results. Delta Force had unveiled the Camerounian, a former coach of Heartland FC of Owerri as the Technical Adviser in March this year. Delta State government acquired Kada City FC’s position in the second round of the NPFL games, after Delta Force FC failed to gain promotion at the end of the Super 8 playoff. The acquisition of Kada City, a former Club of Kaduna State government, was said to have cost Delta State over N200 million. After featuring in the Group B of the NPFL with little to show for the huge amount of money invested on the club, coach Deutsch was made the sacrificial lamp yesterday. A new Technical Adviser, Mr. Mangut Mbwas Ayuba was appointed by the club yesterday. He is on acting capacity. The Club Secretary, Mr. Sylvester Okobi who spoke on behalf of the club’s chairman, Mr. Emmanuel Chidi-Okonkwo made the announcement yesterday. The Guardian learnt yesterday that Governor Ifeanyi Okowa is highly disturbed by the poor management of football clubs in the state. “We have three government clubs in Delta State. They are Delta Force, Warri Wolves and Delta Queens. But the way and manner the clubs are being handled financially is disturbing,” a source close to Delta Force FC told The Guardian. “The problem is actually from the Sports Commission because the officials believe nobody can do them anything since the chairman is the younger brother to the governor. “Sacking the Technical Adviser as a result of poor results was just a way of calling a dog a bad name. Deutsch was not the problem. The problem will still continue,” the source stated. Another source however stated yesterday that coach Deutsch returned to his former club following alleged series of interference by the Delta Sports Commission boss, Tony Okowa. The source wants Tony Okowa removed. Delta Force, which is sitting at a dangerous position in Group B of the NPFL, has a crunch tie against third-placed Ifeanyi Ubah FC of Nnewi at the Ifeanyi Ubah Stadium on Sunday.
