IDPs. PHOTO: blogs.cfr.org Japan yesterday released $1.5 million (about N540 million) to fund community stabilisation activities in the Northeast. The fund will be utilised through an ongoing United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) programme in Nigeria launched in 2016, to support victims of Boko Haram terrorism in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states. This support by Japan aided the rehabilitation of 20 public infrastructures and provided emergency employment to more than 2,000 Internally Displaced People (IDPs) and returnees. In addition, more than 4,000 farmers and over 1,000 small businesses were supported with inputs and capital that helped improve and expand their sources of livelihood. The government of Japan has already invested $6.5 million in the Northeast stabilisation activities, to be utilised within the framework of Integrated Community Stabilisation Programme, which UNDP has been implementing in the region to directly benefit 125,000 people. Acting UNDP Resident Representative, Khardiata Lo Ndiaye, said: “Stabilisation efforts in the Northeast are helping families and communities begin to rely less on humanitarian aid and more on themselves. This support from the government of Japan will go a long way in laying a foundation for development to take place again in the region.” She added that meeting needs of the crisis-affected communities remained a huge challenge requiring more partners and investment. Chargé d’Affaires Ad Interim of Japan, Mr. Shigeru Umetsu, reassured that Japan would continue to support Nigeria’s efforts stabilise livelihoods in the Northeast.
