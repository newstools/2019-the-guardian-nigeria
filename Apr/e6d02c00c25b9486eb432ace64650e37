The management of Lagos State Polytechnic (LASPOTECH), Ikorodu has denied having a hand in the arrest and subsequent trial of eight staff members. It would be recalled that the police had on Tuesday effected the arrest of some union leaders of the polytechnic over alleged attempted murder. The LASPOTECH unionists were arrested for molesting JAMB examiners conducting UTME on the campus. In a statement yesterday by the institution’s Deputy Registrar (Information & Public Relations), Olanrewaju K. Kuye, he said the affected staff members were invited by the police for interrogation and charged to court in line with the dictates of the law. “The suspects were alleged to be involved in assaulting with petrol two officials of Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB), and physically attacked and injured the polytechnic’s Director of ICT on March 29, 2019 during the preparation for the JAMB CBT mock examination in the polytechnic. “The general public could also recall that the Registrar of JAMB, Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, while reporting the readiness of his board for the examination to the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, on April 1, lamented the attempt to set some of his officials ablaze at LASPOTECH centre and vowed to ensure justice is done. “So, the story making the rounds to smear the image of the polytechnic’s management is a calculated attempt to distract the public from the heinous act. The ongoing trial is strictly between the Nigeria Police and the suspects. It has nothing to do with the ongoing trade dispute that is already being attended to by the Lagos State government,” he said.
