 [FILES] President Muhamamdu Buhari  Except Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, both President Shagari and President Obasanjo retained less than 8% of the Ministers that they appointed in their first term. We do not know the percentage of Ministers President Buhari will retain in his second term but expectedly he will do it in his own way in spite of current rumours and innuendos.
