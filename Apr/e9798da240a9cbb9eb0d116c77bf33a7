The Defence Headquarters (DHQ) Friday said a “fictitious document” circulated on some social media platforms in regard to new salary structure for the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) is false. “The DHQ, therefore, wishes to reiterate that the purported new salary scale for members of the AFN being circulated, is nothing but a false and malicious publication intended to cause disaffection among members of the AFN,” acting director defence information Nwachukwu Onyema said in a statement on Friday. “The DHQ wishes to clarify that the said document does not exist; neither does it reflect the true salary structure of personnel of the Armed Forces of Nigeria,” he added. Nwachukwu further stated although Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari has signed a new minimum wage, it is “outrightly mischievous for anyone to circulate fake documents detailing salary structure of the AfN.” “It is also very pertinent for the general public to note that the AFN does not approve salaries for its personnel,” Nwachukwu added.
