Delectable Nollywood actress, Adesua Etomi-Wellington has slammed the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) for abuse of power and like many other Nigerians, she is calling for an end to SARS. Her latest call out of the security force is coming on the heels of the death of Kolade Johnson who was reportedly hit by a stray bullet when some SARS officials shot sporadically while trying to arrest someone. Johnson who was watching a football match at a viewing centre was struck by one of the bullets and he later gave up the ghost. In his reaction to the incident, Bala Elkana who is the spokesman for the Lagos State Police Command told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that he was yet to be briefed of the incident. This comment further stirred an outcry on social media as angry Nigerians called for an end to SARS. 31-year-old Etomi took to her Instagram page and lamented the abuse of power by SARS officials while also demanding that justice be allowed to prevail in the killing of the late Johnson. She wrote, “I am so sick of the abuse of power by SARS. I am so sick of a government that turns deaf ears to the cries of its people. How many people have to die before something is done about this nonsense? Every other day, we hear stories of how citizens are beaten, killed, robbed, kidnapped by SARS. If a tree is producing rotten fruit, cut it down. This is Kolade. His only crime was watching football. That was all he was doing when a stray bullet hit him yesterday. A bullet fired by a SARS official. They fled the scene by the way. So who do we hold responsible? He has a son who now has to grow up without a father, all because some idiot was trigger happy. End Sars for justice for Kola. This has to end.” Bankole Wellington who is married to Etomi has also taken to social media to demand that justice be done in the killing.
