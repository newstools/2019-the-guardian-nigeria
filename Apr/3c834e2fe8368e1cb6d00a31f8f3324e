The Nigeria Association of Agricultural Produce Dealers (NAAPD) has appealed to government at all levels to put in place policies that would put a stop to multiple levies and taxes on farm commodities in the Southwest region of the country. Chairman of NAAPD, South West Zone, Prince Bakare Adeyinka made the plea at an interactive session, in Lagos on the implementation of Federal Government policy on illegal multiple taxes and levies on agricultural produce and agro allied products on highways, markets and parks in the region. According to him, the multiple charges on the highways has led to high cost of foodstuff, noting that there is 100 per cent increase in agro allied commodities in southwest markets when compared to the cost in the north. Adeyinka stressed that these levies and taxes collected on perishable items must be stopped because most of such items rot away due to delays caused by the illegal toll collectors.Speaking on the high cost of transportation and other logistics affecting price of commodities, Adeyinka lamented that additional charges on such produces have multiplier effects on the masses. “The Minister of Agriculture has given us his backing to go all out and sensitize people from the grassroots for us to get the products cheaper and available in the market,” he said.He said the association would do everything possible to ensure that agro allied products would reach the local markets of the zone, but added that government needs to scrap the numerous levies on the roads. Director, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. Paul Oranachi said government was overwhelmed with the multiple collections from illegal operators.He stressed the need for a committee to be set up for the purpose of enforcement, adding that the ministry of Justice would be involved for legal backing. The interactive programme organised by the agriculture dealers in conjunction with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, had heads of departments, agricultural and social services in the 57 Local Government and Local Council Development Area (LCDAs) of the state in attendance.
