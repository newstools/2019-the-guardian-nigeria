The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle now have their very own official Instagram page. This means they no longer share accounts with Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince William and Kate Middleton. The move comes just two weeks after the Palace announced Meghan and Harry were getting their own royal household (essentially, their own office where their staff is based in British monarchy terms) separate from Prince William and Kate Middleton. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s updates can now be gotten on @sussexroyal. A statement from them reads: “Welcome to our official Instagram; we look forward to sharing the work that drives us, the causes we support, important announcements, and the opportunity to shine a light on key issues. We thank you for your support, and welcome you to @sussexroyal.”- Harry & Meghan
