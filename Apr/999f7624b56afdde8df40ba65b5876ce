Nigerian Stock Exchange The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) extended its losing streak to the second trading session of the week and month of April, occasioned by sustained losses in highly capitalised stocks, especially Betaglass and Forte oil. The losses resulted to a further decline in market capitalisation by N114 billion. Yesterday, the All Share Index (ASI) shed 300.73 absolute points, representing a dip of 1.0 per cent to close at 30,226.77 points. Similarly, the market capitalisation shed N114 billion to close at N11.353 trillion. The downturn was impacted by price depreciation in medium and large capitalised stocks, among which are, Nestle Nigeria, Beta Glass, Nigerian Breweries, Unilever Nigeria and Forte Oil. Analysts at Afrinvest Limited said the negative performance recorded thus far would persist in subsequent trading sessions. “We do not rule out the possibility of an upturn in the performance of the benchmark index as investors continue to take position in fundamentally attractive stocks.”
