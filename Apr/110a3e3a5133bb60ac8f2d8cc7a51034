Josiah Jesse Ransome-Kuti was born to Egba’s parents on June 1, 1855. His grandparents were from the town of Igbein but became a part of the first settlers of Abeokuta after it was founded in 1830. Four years after he was born, he was baptised a Christian by his mother to the dismay of his father, a staunch traditionalist. His father‘s death in 1863 laid to rest, the struggle to convert him back to his African roots. He grew up a strong Christian and headed to Church Missionary Society (CMS) Training Institution, Abeokuta and then transferred to CMS Training Institute in 1871.
