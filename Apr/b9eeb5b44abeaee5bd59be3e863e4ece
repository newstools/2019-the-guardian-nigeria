Naira Marley has never been one to shy away from supporting the advanced fee fraud perpetrated by Nigerians. Despite the issues of misinformed identity as well as the effect on businesses and trust in Nigeria, Naira Marley is convinced that there is nothing wrong with it. In a recent outburst of Instagram Live, he blasted Simi for “acting up” when he asked her a question. “Am i a Yahoo boy?” he questioned. “If you know about slavery, you’d know Yahoo Yahoo is not a crime,” he wrote in another Instagram post. Naira Marley is not only a shame to the music industry, but also a shame to Nigeria! This should not be taken lightly by the FG. There can never be any justification for ‘Yahoo’, it is illegal and should be curbed! pic.twitter.com/e5LcpN3BI8 — Adeyinka Oluwamayowa (@MrSEPTIN911) April 23, 2019  Right under his comment page, Tunde Ednut blasted him for this statement. But he got rebuffed in the statement after Davido came to Niara Marley’s defence: Read More: Adekunle Gold Called Out For Allegedly Editing Documents For Yahoo Boys <img class="aligncenter wp-image-908962 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Davido-Naira-Marley-870x1152.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1325" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Davido-Naira-Marley-870x1152.jpg 870w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Davido-Naira-Marley-451x598.jpg 451w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Davido-Naira-Marley-421x557.jpg 421w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Davido-Naira-Marley-841x1114.jpg 841w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Davido-Naira-Marley-181x240.jpg 181w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Davido-Naira-Marley-362x480.jpg 362w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Davido-Naira-Marley-453x600.jpg 453w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Davido-Naira-Marley.jpg 906w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /> In spite of this, Ruggedman released a statement schooling the artistes on why it is a crime. @Nairamarley My brother, I love your music and all but you need to get one thing clear and do not mislead people. Especially kids on social media. You can do Yahoo all you want, but do not disrespect the part of the black race that were sold into slavery by trying to use it to justify cybercrime. The people who bought slaves died ages ago. If you want to fight that, then start a cause/movement against the British and America. Whoever owned slaves, but stealing the hard earned money of other people isn’t about slavery. You say the Nigerian leaders are looting trillions outta this country, why aren’t you hacking their accounts and giving back to the people Robin Hood style? I swear I go hail you for that one. Yet, it appears that the backlash from supporters of Naira Marley had finally gotten in the way of Tunde Ednut. This is because of another Instagram Live video showing him apologise to Naira Marley for criticising him. Take a look: Tunde Ednut went live on IG with Naira Marley to apologize about going against Yahoo. pic.twitter.com/okNkvZP60r — Biyi The Plug  (@BiyiThePlug) April 23, 2019  What are your thoughts on this?
