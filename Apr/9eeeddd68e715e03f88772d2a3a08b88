Former governor of Abia State, Orji Kalu, has urged the nation’s political leaders to focus on governance and forgot the issues of the last election. Kalu disclosed this yesterday in Lagos while speaking at the second annual lecture of Swaaya Limited, publishers of FreedomOnline, entitled ‘Fixing The Economy: Less Politics, More Substance’.He said the purpose of elections was to elect leaders to make positive changes in the society and not to play politics for eternity.“I was so surprised that some politicians have started talking about the 2023 election, rather than start work to justify the mandate given to them in the last election. “There is time for everything; there is time for politics and there is time for governance. This is the time for governance and that is what we should focus on as political leaders across parties.”The former governor praised the publisher of Freedomonline, Gabriel Akinadewo, for what he had achieved within a few years of starting the online news medium.
