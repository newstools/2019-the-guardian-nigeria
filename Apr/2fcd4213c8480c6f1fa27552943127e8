Angola, however, defeated Nigeria 2-1 to revenge their 0-1 loss to Eaglets earlier. 						                    PHOTO: CAF  It was a sorry sight for a team that qualified for the FIFA U-17 World Cup in Brazil with just two matches played, and a game in hand before their fortunes plummeted. All attempts by Olatomi Olaniyan and Charles Etim to ensure that the team finished among the best three in the competition failed, as tournament’s top scorer, Osvaldo Capemba got the curtain raiser. Wisdom Ubani restored parity for the Eaglets after two minutes. Despite creating chances, the Eaglets failed to make them count owing to poor tactical approach. With a man down after Angola’s Porfirio Abrantes was shown a second yellow card, the Eaglets again kept wasting begging chances to take the lead until the Angolans, through Andre Sebastio Zito ripped through Nigeria’s defence to slot in the winning goal. All efforts to make amends against the team they had earlier defeated 1-0 during the preliminary round of the tournament failed to yield fruits.Meanwhile, Cameroun will take on Guinea today, in Dar es Salaam to decide the champions of the 2019 U-17 AFCON.
