We are entitled to daydream or indulge in a certain level of fantasies about how we want love to treat us but don’t get carried away and forget to put in actual work. When you meet someone, most of the time we are blown away by the individuals looks or whatever it is that attracts us. But after a few dates, we go beyond having long lost gazes to getting to see beyond the presence of that person. In other words, we begin to study and understand what he or she likes and dislikes. To get a better hang of this, as much as most people don’t observe it, ensure to know what your significant other’s love language is whether  it is Acts of Service, Words of Affirmation, Physical Touch, Receiving Gifts as stated by Gary Chapman, author of The Five Love Languages: How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate. These love languages give an insight into what means the most to you and your partner, and also what can hurt you the most. For example, if quality time dominates your partner’s love language, this means you have to find a way around giving your full, undivided attention while conversing, watching a movie, etc because this is what makes him or her feel most loved. One of the most common issues with love languages is projection. When our dominating love languages are lacking in attention, one of the common signs is projecting your love language onto your partner, in hopes, they will reciprocate and fulfil your need for attention in that area. This commonly causes problems in partners that have differing love languages. What’s most important and helpful is being dedicated and willing to find a grey area where both your different languages can align, for the betterment of your relationship.
