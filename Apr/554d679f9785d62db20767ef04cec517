Netflix’s upcoming documentary is tackling the controversy surrounding marijuana and digging into its history in the United States. Grass Is Greener features some of America’s professed stoners, one of which is none other than Snoop Dogg. As an artist heavily influenced by the drug, he aims to show how art, music and weed all connect. The documentary will also show how the drug has affected Black and Latino communities over the years, and the struggles people of colour face when contributing to the growing legal marijuana industry “We’re not the war on drugs, we’re fighting the war on drugs,” Snoop explains in the trailer. Grass Is Greener is set to be released on April 20. Watch the trailer below.
