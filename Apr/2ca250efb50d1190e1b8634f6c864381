Award-wining singer and actress, Selena Gomez has opened up about her love life and revealed that she in search of someone who will love her for the person she is. The “Come and Get it” hitmaker made this known on a podcast after suffering series of breakups. While speaking on the “Dream It Real” podcast yesterday, April 24, the 26-year old star the show’s host, Heben Nigatu, that she often feels misjudged when it comes to her heart. Gomez said: “I think that a lot of people don’t understand my heart, you know? I also don’t like that, it can sometimes be about appearance, too. I don’t really appreciate people judging me on my looks or anything like that. I just think that the world today, with so much exposure to everything… it’s great to dress up and to feel beautiful and to do those things, but…and I’m flattered when, maybe, guys are like, ‘You’re pretty,’ I am, it’s just not…I would just love someone to love me for the person that I am. That’s just what’s important to me.’ It would be recalled that Gomez’s longtime on and off boyfriend, Justin Bieber married model, Hailey Baldwin in 2018. This was coming shortly after his breakup with Gomez who left singer, The Weeknd to get back with Bieber. Gomez also had an emotional breakdown in 2018 that saw her checking into a mental health facility. It was alleged in some quarters that Bieber’s marriage to Baldwin played a part in Gomez’s breakdown. She is since out of rehab and is expected to make her grand return with some new music.
