Sudo power couple Offset and Cardi B have recently released a music video for their hit song “Clout”. Toward the end of Offset’s solo debut album Father of 4, Cardi B came on board for the track and it has been widely accepted since its release. The video opens with Offset at a piano, miming the track’s opening notes from behind a mask and things just get hype as what follows is a whole lot of yellow, sick bars and of course Cardi B being her usual sexually expressive self. The video was shot and directed by Daniel Russell with creative direction from Offset and Joseph Desrosiers Jr. Watch “Clout” via YouTube below;
