 Enyimba coach, Abd’Allah  The Peoples Elephant are currently second in group A table of the NPFL with 20 points after 13 matches, while the Benin Arsenal, with 12 games played, are ninth on the log with 15 points. The first round fixture between them played at the UNIBEN Sport Complex ended goalless. Speaking to The Guardian yesterday, Abdullah said his boys would be coming all out to make sure that they grab the three points at stake towards securing a place in the play-off. “We are coming all out to win in tomorrow’s game, because as you know, our position is not confirmed yet. When you look at our place on the log and the points we have, and you compare them with the teams behind us, you will see that there is not much difference. So, there is no way we will want to make any mistake and drop a point at home. “Our next two games at home will determine the season for us if we are going to book a place in the play-off or not. And once we secure the six points at home this week and next, then I think we might be able to go back to the top of the table. “From there, we will see how we go, because Rangers, who are also doing well, are coming right behind us with some outstanding matches. The only thing for us now is to keep on winning at home and taking points or even winning in our away fixtures to confirm our position for the play-off,” he said. Abdullah, who appealed to the fans to come out en masse and support the team to victory, said their presence at the stadium would spur the team to more wins, which would make them happy.“We are happy with the way our fans have been supporting us and I hope they will keep on doing that and I assure them that we too will make them happy,” he stated.
