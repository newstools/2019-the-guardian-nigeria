Katy Perry played dress-up at this weekend’s Disney-themed episode of American Idol, wearing a full-on Ursula costume. “Tonight there will be some poor unfortunate souls,” she joked Sunday night, on social media, where she shared photos of her Little Mermaid villain-inspired look as the episode aired on ABC. The Idol judge — with purple face makeup and an ensemble with tentacles — watched the night’s contestants as Ursula while they performed songs from Disney films like Toy Story, Tangled, Tarzan and more.
