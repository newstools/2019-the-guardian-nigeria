At no time did the executive forwarded the figure of N78, 601, 631, 430, 16 to us and we do not know where the President got that figure from.“We have decided to make this clarification to set the records straight and disabuse the minds of the public. We believe the President must have been misinformed and misadvised by his aides while writing the letter he sent on this issue to the National Assembly.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
