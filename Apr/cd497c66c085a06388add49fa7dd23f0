David stated that an estimated 80 per cent of NCD deaths occur in low and middle income countries, adding that the World Health Organisation (WHO) had projected the casualty figures to increase by 17 per cent over the next 10 years.According to him, addressing NCDs in Nigeria was a multi-professional challenge with numerous implications.He pointed out that the brain drain in the health sector could not be addressed without budgetary commitments from government.
