• NANS, group laud Buhari, implore governors to immediately implement
Chairman of the Trade Union Congress (TUC) in Kwara State, Kolawole Olumoh, has urged government at all levels to curb any irrational increase in the prices of commodities.According to News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), Olumoh stated this at the weekend in Ilorin while speaking on the presidential assent to the new minimum wage bill. The TUC leader, who applauded President Muhammadu Buhari for giving Nigerian workers a new wage, noted however that the concern was that marketers and manufacturers would increase prices of their products irrationally.“We appreciate the President for the quick assent and a promise fulfilled. “However, it is of concern that marketers and manufacturers alike may seize this as an opportunity to irrationally increase prices of their products.“This will impact negatively on the increased value of our wages,’’ he said. Olumoh explained that for the purchasing power of a new minimum wage to be useful, impactful and effective, government at all levels must assist in protecting and enforcing measures that would curb irrational increase in prices of commodities. Meanwhile, the Buhari Support Organisation (BSO) has commended the President for signing the N30,000 minimum wage bill.Chairman of the organisation in Enugu State, Chief Anike Nwoga, in a statement, said that Buhari’s name would now go down in history as the most masses and labour-friendly President in Nigeria.He said Buhari had paid back to the masses, who had supported him serially since his first presidential election in 2003, by signing the N30, 000 minimum wage into law. Also, the National Association of Nigerian students (NANS) has commended Buhari for signing into law the minimum wage.According to NAN, the association gave the commendation in a statement signed by its National Public Relations Officer (PRO) in Abuja, Mr. Adeyemi Azeez, yesterday. Azeez described Buhari’s action as an obvious relief on the pains of Nigerian workers, saying that it will ease the unbearable income of the civil servants.
