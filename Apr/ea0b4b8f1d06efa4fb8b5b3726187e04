 President, NCRIB, Shola Tinubu  “In the light of recent building collapse in Lagos and Oyo states, as well as other similar disasters, the NCRIB is quite touched. It is our belief that the unfortunate incidences are actually accentuated greatly by the lax of regulatory enforcement in the construction environment. “To combat this, Government needs to be more proactive in implementing building laws. Also, they have to continually engage stakeholders in the construction built environment and related institutions to elicit their input for a long lasting solution to the malaise. 
 
“While the Council commiserates with the victims of the building collapse, we like to use this opportunity again to call on government to give more impetus to the implementation of the enforcement of compulsory building insurance as enshrined in Section 64 and Section 65 of Insurance Act 2003. “Similarly, Nigerians are also advised to, on their own, insure their personal assets in order to mitigate their losses when and if losses of this dimension do occur. Every individual should ideally live up to his responsibility of care by protecting whatever is valuable to him or her, both life and property. Our slogan has been: ‘Whatever is worth having, is worth insuring,’” he said.
 
The Executive Secretary of the NCRIB, Fatai Adegbenro, lauded government for borrowing to finance infrastructure, stressing that the development of infrastructure will impact the insurance industry positively.According to him, the development of infrastructure will help create more jobs, which would in return, enable the citizenry acquire assets that they will need insurance policy to protect.
