Despite the multiple charges of sexual abuse facing him, RnB star, R. Kelly is still making cool cash in his home state of Illinois as the Grammy award-winning singer he raked in $22,000 (N7,917,580) to show his face at a nightclub and hang out for only an hour. According to earlier media reports, the embattled singer came out of hiding last Saturday for a paid club appearance at the Dirty South Lounge in Springfield, Illinois, where he interacted with the small crowd and belted out the opening line to his hit song “Bump N’ Grind.” It is gathered that Kelly took home $20k (N7,197,800) and paid his booking agent $2k (N719,780). It is also learnt that Kelly didn’t even have to sing but simply picked up the mic just for fun and that only about 50 people showed up for Kelly. He arrived at the club at 10:30 pm but didn’t come out to greet fans until 2 AM. It would be recalled that prior to his club appearance, Kelly went on Instagram before his paid gig, asking the media to take it easy on him when he’s seen in the club drinking and partying. He made it clear he’s just showing up to collect a cheque. As it stands, Kelly needs the money considering he is struggling to pay child support to his ex-wife as he waits to stand trial on 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse involving underage girls.
