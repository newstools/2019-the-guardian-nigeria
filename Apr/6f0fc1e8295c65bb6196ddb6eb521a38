 [FILES] Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE)  In summary, the All Share Index (ASI) gained 224.65 absolute points, representing a growth of 0.76 per cent to close at 29,970.86 points. Similarly, the market capitalisation gained N84 billion to close at N11.257 trillion. The bullish performance can be attributed to gains by some bellwethers including Nestle Nigeria, Dangote Cement, Nigerian Breweries, Access Bank, and Dangote Flour Mills. Analysts attributed the sustained upward trend to positive earnings of Nigeria’s three biggest lenders, Access Bank, Zenith Bank, and Guaranty Trust Bank that stimulated investors’ sentiment. Afrinvest Limited however said: “The relatively weak investor sentiment portends that the last trading session of the week may be dominated by profit-taking activities especially in bellwethers that had recorded gains in previous sessions.” But Vetiva Capital Limited believes that: “As earning results continue to trickle in, we expect to see more pronounced reactions to the results, as seen for Access (PAT growth of 88% y/y) than we saw during the FY’18 results season. Following the release of positive Guaranty and Zenith Bank results, we expect to see investors respond positively leading the ASI to another positive close. However, we don’t rule out the possibility of profit-taking.”
