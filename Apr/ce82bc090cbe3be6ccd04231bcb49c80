The City of Chicago is planning on suing Jussie Smollett after the actor refused to pay for the investigation of the hate crime he reported which turned out to be fabricated by Smollett. Mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel’s law chief sent a letter to Smollett demanding he reimburse the city for the funds they used to investigate his case, totaling to $130,106.15. The deadline for that payment was yesterday (Thursday 4th April). “Mr. Smollett has refused to reimburse the City of Chicago for the cost of police overtime spent investigating his false police report on January 29th, 2019,“According to TMZ, a spokesperson for the City said. “The Law Department is now drafting a civil complaint that will be filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County. Once it is filed, the Law Department will send a courtesy copy of the complaint to Mr. Smollett’s L.A. based legal team.” If the city eventually sues, it will be able to sue for three times the amount they previously asked, pushing the total number up to $390,000.
