 Kogi State Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello.  It described Bello’s administration as four years of waste and disaster that left bitter taste in the mouths of citizens.In a statement yesterday in Lokoja by the publicity secretary, Bode Ogunmola, Kogi PDP said the governor’s director-general of media and publicity, Kingsley Fanwo, lied on national television about the true position of development in the state. The party described the position of Fanwo, who appeared on Channels Television’s ‘Politics Today’, a discussion programme, where he claimed that Bello’s administration had several completed projects to its credit, as “white lies”, saying that there was no project for Mr. President to commission in Kogi. The PDP called on Fanwo to seek forgiveness from his creator and apologise to the people of the state for his “woeful performance in turning logic on its head, peddling lies to deceive members of the public.”Ogunmola insisted that no single project, except hunger, poverty and suicide, could be attributed to Bello’s administration. The PDP described as false the allegation that the administration of Governor Idris Wada accessed a N20 billion bond, saying “for the records, the administration was only able to access N8 billion from the money, while it is on record that the balance of N12 billion has been accessed by the present administration with nothing to show.” According to the PDP, out of the N8 billion the PDP administration got, it began work on the dualisation of the ‘Welcome to Lokoja’ to the New Market road, that is now abandoned by the present administration.It noted with disappointment that the uncompleted Omi Rice project, a private initiative, was a conduit pipe to defraud Kogi people.The statement assured that the APC administration in the state would expire in November.
