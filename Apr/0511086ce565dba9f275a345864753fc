Capital market operators have been irked by the loss of value put at about N4.5 trillion in the last one year, blaming the government for the slow pace of development witnessed in the nation’ s capital market, which has persisted over the years.
 
The operators who renewed the call on government to urgently initiate intervention measures either directly or indirectly, to help reverse the long reign of bears and revive the market, lamented that government has not invested in such a way that could encourage people to participate in the development projects.According to them, there is no visible evidence of direct or indirect government funding in the development of the market or incentives for institutions responsible for market development by providing the necessary funds and ensuring that they have proper logistics to carry people along.
  
Indeed, the market has been engulfed by persistent sell pressure and investors’ apathy since the first quarter of 2018, after the market had recorded significant upsurge in 2017, with an increase of N4.5 trillion in market capitalisation, which conferred it the third best performing stock exchange in the world then.Specifically, the capitalisation, which stood at N15.55 trillion as at February 28, 2018, now stands at N11.02 trillion as at Thursday, April 11, 2019, representing N4.5 trillion or 41.5 per cent loss.  “The way it works, if they buy through them, they can target some companies, buy stocks of these companies and by the time they do this, there will be activity in the market and you see a lot of investors both foreign and local returning to the market.“It would stimulate the market with liquidity. They should not give us money but invest and when these companies pay dividend it goes to them.” 
 
A stockbroker with Calex Securities Limited, Tunde Oyediran, stressed the need for government to fund the capital market through investing a percentage of the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) into the market to cushion the effect of macroeconomic headwinds on the market.“Government can set aside a percentage of the SWF, be it five per cent or 10 per cent, as a stabilisation fund and use it to buy stocks now that the market is down to boost investors’ confidence and when the market stabilizes, they sell the stocks and regain their money.“Stabilisation fund is used to stabilise the market when every body is selling and nobody is buying. This is when government comes into the market and releases some amount of money into the market to buy stocks and as they are buying, even the foreign investors will know that there are no fundamental issues with the listed firms,” he added.
