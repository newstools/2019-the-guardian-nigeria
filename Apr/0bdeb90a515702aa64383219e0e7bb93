Who would have imagined Labrinth, Sia and Diplo on a track, not to mention an album; that’s as good as extra icing on an already sumptuous cake! Too good! The trio made their debut in mid-2018 under the supergroup pseudonym with the release of “Genius.” Since then, they have trickled out a number of other singles including “Audio,” “No New Friends” and the wildly popular hit, “Thunderclouds.” Now, the pop power squad has dropped a full-length debut album, Labrinth, Sia & Diplo Present… LSD, which arrived just before midnight on Friday (April 12). “When we got the chance to do LSD, we jumped at it, and it’s one of the most creative projects I’ve been involved in,” Labrinth recently told The Rolling Stone. “We dress up in crazy outfits, mess around with Sgt. Pepper’s-esque visuals; we’ve created animations for the band. You can be ballsy and be out there. It feels like you’re not the frontman, so it allows us to go as crazy and as f**ked up as we want to go. And that works for us.” Listen to Labrinth, Sia & Diplo Present… LSD in full here.
