 Minister of Health,  Prof. Isaac Adewole  Adewole, in a statement yesterday, said the federal government had recently been notified by the Ukrainian Ministry of Health that it could not guarantee the quality of education delivered by Odessa National Medical University. The minister said the decision by the Ukrainian ministry was based on the result of an International Monitoring Study of Quality of Higher Medical Education conducted in Ukrainian medical universities dated March 25, 2019 from which Odessa exempted itself. He, therefore, advised Nigerian students seeking admission into institutions in Ukraine to note the development before submitting their applications.
