On his part, the chairman, MFM Football Club, Mr Godwin Enakhena, who was one of the invited guests, said sports and education are important in children’s lives and should not be neglected. “Inter-house sports is also a platform where opportunities are given to the kids to showcase their hidden talents and for them to be fished out by people that are willing to take them to the next phase of sports. “A footballer who earns one million naira or above when he or she sustains injury, the career ends but with education he or she can continue. The place of Sports is important in a growth of a child and the place of education can not also be compromised,” Enakhena said. He urged government to provide more sporting facilities to enable the athletes function properly. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
