Chief Pyagbara Legborsi, The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) has denounced the killing of an Ogoni man in Kegbara Dere community by an Army officer. MOSOP President, Legborsi Pyagbara, urged security agencies to stop reckless killings in Ogoni communities. He said MOSOP had on Friday received report of military raid in Kegbara Dere which led to the death of a middle aged man, Nen-elkpege Lezor, and one Lenu Kpegezor, who was shot, but in critical condition. “Even though the Movement is in support of genuine efforts by legitimate authorities to fight criminality in Ogoniland and other parts of the country, we do not support and will not tolerate unprovoked military onslaught and reckless killings in any Ogoni community or elsewhere” MOSOP has therefore urged the military or any arm of the security agencies to always act within the ambit of the law. “We call on relevant security agencies, particularly the Police to urgently commence investigation into the reported military raid and killing in Kegbara Dere Community to ensure all those behind the unwarranted operations are brought to book to avert total break down of law and order,” he said. According to him, it is unacceptable that military men will come into Ogoni community to provide security for Shell workers, but end up killing the natives.
