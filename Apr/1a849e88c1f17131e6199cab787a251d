Veteran Nigerian actor, Babatunde Omidina better known by his alias, Baba Suwe has finally arrived in the United States of America for medical treatment. It would be recalled that popular Yoruba comic actor solicited for funds to help treat chronic diabetes and members of the public as well as well-meaning Nigerians donated to his cause. The vice president of Nigeria, Professor Yemi Osinbajo who was among the many prominent Nigerians to donate gave the actor one million naira. Sharing a photo and video of Baba Suwe alongside his son, Sola Omidina in the US, Nollywood actor, Yomi Fabiyi reported that the veteran star would be getting treatment in the states. Baba Suwe was so excited as he arrived in the US that he once again thanked everyone that came to his aid. Born in August of 1958, Baba Suwe began acting in 1972 but came into limelight after he featured in a film titled, “Omolasan”. He rose to major prominence when he featured in “Iru Esin” in 1997. In 2011, he was alleged of cocaine trafficking by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, an allegation that was described as false and defamatory by the ruling of the Lagos high court of law.
