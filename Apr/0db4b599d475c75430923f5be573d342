But the company also said the crisis over the 737 MAX could dent revenues as the “timing of the MAX’s return to service is uncertain.” “We have not changed our engine production plans at this time,” Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller said on the call. “But the timing of cash flows may be impacted by collections of receivables from Boeing, depending on when aircraft deliveries resume. We will continue to adjust our operational management as this situation evolves.” The company on Tuesday reported better-than-expected quarterly profits on improved performance in most industrial divisions, including aviation and oil and gas, suggesting a corporate turnaround was beginning to gain steam.
