The Abuja Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has arrested four suspects for allegedly attempting to carry out a fraudulent bank wire transfer of $200,000( N72, 000, 000) from an unsuspecting foreigner’s bank account. The four suspected fraudsters are Ajiero Onyeka, Clement Peter, Mustapha Zubiri, and Agbo Austine Taylor. “A team of EFCC operatives swooped down on the suspects as they were about to transfer the said amount from the account of an unsuspecting foreigner into a domiciliary account in Nigeria,” EFCC’s spokesman Tony Orilade said in a statement on Saturday. “The Commission was tipped off when the suspects were sourcing for domiciliary account number which they will use to receive the money,” he added. Orilade further stated that bank wire transfer fraudsters have a practice of using other people’s domiciliary account to receive fraudulent money with the promise of giving the account holder a commission from the money. He said in some other instances, some of the account holders will be kept totally in the dark as to the source of the fund until when the transaction is completed, “The account holder will become the hunted criminal, while the main perpetrator will disappear without traces,” he added. Orilade, however, warned the public to be vigilant and not to give out their account numbers for the purpose of receiving money on behalf of anyone. “The suspects will be charged to court as soon as investigation is concluded,” he affirmed.
