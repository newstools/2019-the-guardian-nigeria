Nigeria teen actress, Regina Daniels, has again flaunted a multimillion-naira Ferrari car on the streets of Abuja, amidst allegations that she tied the knot as the sixth wife of billionaire, Ned Nwoko. Regina has been on everyone’s lips following reports that she got married to the 59-year-old politician, shortly after she flaunted the two luxurious rides, as well as the new house she got for her mother. It was also revealed that she has been flying around with the billionaire’s private jet prior to their rumoured marriage. Now, Regina has been spotted with the wonderful Ferrari in a post showing her in Transcorp Hilton Hotel in Abuja at the time the photo was taken. Regina also shared videos and photos of herself driving the hot red Ferrari around Abuja and she had been seen living her best life as she cruised around in the car blasting loud music. But she did not reveal if the Ferrari was recently bought by her or for her or if it was a friend’s car she was riding.
