Nipsey Hussle was shot dead in the US city of Los Angeles Sunday, sparking an outpouring of grief from fellow celebrities as the city’s mayor blamed “senseless gun violence.” Local media reported Hussle, 33, was shot in front of his own clothing store Sunday afternoon at close range, by a man who fled in a getaway car. Hussle, an Eritrean-American born Ermias Asghedom and raised in LA’s Crenshaw district, had transformed the block he would hustle on into a retail, job-creating hub for his Marathon Clothing company. He had also backed Destination Crenshaw — an open-air museum describing itself as “1.3 miles of art & culture celebrating black LA” — along with a science, tech and math education center. “He was not just a rapper,” said activist Ali. “Nipsey was our shining black prince who overcame adversity and gang life to become a Grammy-nominated artist and one of our most influential community leaders.” “He could’ve easily moved to a gated community — he chose to stay.” In the end, Hussle’s life was taken on the very corner he sought to revive, shot several times at close range by a suspect still at large. News of his death saw many fans sharing his songs — he didn’t release a label debut album until last year’s acclaimed “Victory Lap,” but boasted a number of mixtapes — with his poignant lyricism lighting up social media. “I’m just young and I’m reckless, I’m just on for my section,” he rapped in one song, “Ocean Views.” “I just write down these confessions… died to get life around me, I guess that I’m an exception / Blessings.”
