By a bizarre quirk of the fixture list, City play Spurs in the Premier League on Saturday, and Liverpool now turn their attention to a Cardiff side whose bid to remain in English football’s top flight was revived by their 2-0 win at Brighton on Tuesday. “Neil (Warnock) and Cardiff have gained a lot of confidence in the last game and rightly so,” he said. “It was a massive game against Brighton, if Cardiff had lost that game then the fight for the league would be finished but now it starts again for all the teams. “Everything came together and that’s what makes football so exciting. They believe in their chances and I would do the same, so we have to show we are ready for this battle.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
