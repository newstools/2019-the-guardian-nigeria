Reality TV star and mother of three, Kim Kardashian West has landed an age long dream of hers, she is the cover star of Vogue Magazine. Although she has covered Vogue before, this is her first cover as she had to share her previous cover with husband, Kanye West. The businesswoman during her Vogue interview opened up about her West’s bipolar disorder among other things. On handling her husband’s mental health, she said: “I think we’re in a pretty good place with it now. It is an emotional process, for sure. Right now everything is really calm. But we can definitely feel episodes coming, and we know how to handle them. For him, being on medication is not really an option, because it just changes who he is. Traveling a lot does set it off, so he doesn’t travel as much as he used to. But honestly, I never want to speak for him, because I am not in his mind. But I think some of the hurtful things that I read online . . . . What is she doing? She’s not stopping him. . . . Like it’s my fault if he does or says something that they don’t agree with? That’s my husband. I share every opinion that I have and let him know when I think something’s wrong. Or if it comes to him being in the middle of a bipolar episode, I’ll do everything to be supportive and help to calm the situation.” The Wests are currently expecting their fourth child together and are considered one of Hollywood’s most powerful and influential couples despite their controversial nature.
