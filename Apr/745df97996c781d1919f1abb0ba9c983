Media personality, Toke Makinwa has had a lot of unsavoury things said about her on social media but if there is one thing that is admirable about her, she has been able to keep her cool. However, even the most patient of humans has their boiling point and it appears the best-selling author has just reached hers. Taking to Instagram to call out Nigerian comedian, Bovi for a joke he made about her during his show, “Bovi: Man on Fire” which held over the weekend, Makinwa called him an unfunny comedian and also said she thinks he is more of annoying. “Never done this before but there’s always a first. 
Dear @officialbovi First off, i actually don’t even think you are funny, more like annoying. Making a joke about my ass was real cute but one thing my dear friend, my doctor is a Gee, he got it right the first time. Just so you know cos That’s the shit that pissed me the fuck off!!!!! P.S,
You ain’t shit

TM” As of the time of filing this report, Bovi is yet to respond to her callout. In times past Toke Makinwa has talked about her plastic surgery. According to her, a woman should enhance her body if she has the inclination to. She also urged women not to allow anyone to stop them from considering having a body makeover. She further buttressed her point by attributing the skills of cosmetic surgeons as a gift from God.
