Al Bello/Getty Images/AFP  French Open champion Halep, who last held the top spot in January, would have returned to the summit had she reached the final in Florida following Osaka’s early exit. Halep reduced Osaka’s lead to 239 points and moved above Petra Kvitova after the Czech fell to eventual champion Ashleigh Barty in the last eight. Estonia’s Anett Kontaveit climbed to a best of 14th as she jumped five places following her run to the semi-finals. WTA rankings on April 1: 1. Naomi Osaka (JPN)  6,021 pts 2.
