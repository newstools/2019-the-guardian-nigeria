Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer Tuesday said he hopes the Red Devils change their mindset when they host neighbours Manchester City in Wednesday’s English Premier League clash. “It’s about changing mindsets and making sure our heads are ready because anyone’s heads will drop when you lose like that,” Solskjaer told Sky Sports Premier League. United’s hopes of clinching a Uefa Champions League spot with a top-four finish at the end of the season hit the rocks after a humbling 4 – 0 thrashing from Everton at Goodison Park on Sunday. The defeat at the weekend has sparked more criticisms of Solskjaer’s tactical ability to manage Manchester United. Manchester United have only won one of their last four matches. The run of form is far from the Solskjaer’s wish for the team. “I came in here saying I’m going to enjoy every single second of this.” However, the hope for next season’s Champions League football is not all lost for Manchester United as a win over Manchester City will take the Red Devils to the fifth position, a point above Arsenal on the Premier League table. But Solskjaer is wary of Manchester City’s pressing prowess when they have the ball. “We have got to be ready for their pressing.” “They have got the quality on the ball so we have got to defend well, and when we win it we have got to be ready for their aggression,” Solskjaer said. Manchester City, on the other hand, knows only a win at Old Trafford will heighten their hopes of retaining the Premier League title over current table-toppers Liverpool. A win for Pep Guardiola led Man City will put them on 89 points- one over Liverpool, who are gunning for their first Premier League title in the new era. The Citizens will do all to avoid a draw or loss on Wednesday night. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
