At the root of his anger on Friday was a “very clear” penalty that was not awarded to his side. “Do you know why the referee didn’t give it? Maradona asked reporters. “Because you’re going to say tomorrow that it’s because it’s Maradona team.” Dorados extended their unbeaten run in the league to eight games and sit third in the standings, having lost to leaders Atletico San Luis in December’s Apertura final.
