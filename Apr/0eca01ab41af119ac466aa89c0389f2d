The doctors were already there, he never managed to get over the death of Emi,” Progreso mayor Julio Mueller said. Emiliano, 28, was on his way to Cardiff City after the Premier League side had signed him for a club record £15million ($19.7million) from Nantes. The pilot, David Ibbotson, also died in the January 21 tragedy. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
