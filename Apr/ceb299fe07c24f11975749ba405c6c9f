The former French international is expected to end his 12-year Bayern career at the end of this season and is in line to add to his domestic haul of eight league titles and five German Cups before he leaves. Bayern faces Bremen for the second time in a matter of days, having beaten them 1-0 at home in the league on Saturday. On Wednesday, they travel to the Weserstadion to fight for a place in the German Cup final against RB Leipzig on May 25. Aside from Ribery, Niko Kovac’s side is also missing Arjen Robben and goalkeeper Manuel Neuer through injury, while centre-back Niklas Suele is serving a one-game suspension in the cup.
