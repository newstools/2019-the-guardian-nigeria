As the most anticipated movie of the year, Avengers End game starts showing in cinemas, Google has unveiled a special feature to unleash Thanos’ powers in the Marvel Comic movie on the web. Google brought to (internet) life, Thanos’ chilling finger snap of the infinity gauntlet at the end of Marvel’s Infinity war. Just as the half the world’s population turned to dust after the snap in the movie, so will your search results turn to dust at the snap of the gauntlet. Here’s how to get it done: Search Thanos on Google you’ll get an image of his gauntlet next to his picture. Click on Thanos’ Infinity-stone studded gauntlet in the upper right corner of Google’s search results and watch as Thanos’ destructive powers turn your searches to dust be it on your desktop or mobile. See a video of our search: The villain decimated half of the universe's population at one go at the end of Infinity War, which left many characters wondering if their favourite superheroes will be resurrected. However, Google might have also embedded a spoiler in this search, as once Thanos is done erasing half of your search results, if you click the gauntlet again, the supervillain will use the time stone to bring back all the search results.
