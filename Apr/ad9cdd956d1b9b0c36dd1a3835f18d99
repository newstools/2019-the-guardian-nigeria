Céline Dion has landed her first-ever beauty deal and it is with none other than, L’Oreal Paris. The singer has sold more than 245 million albums worldwide; she has also become a fashion icon in recent years and went on to create a line of gender-neutral children’s clothes, Celinenununu. Earlier today, L’Oréal Paris announced Céline as its newest Global Spokesperson. Her first campaign with the brand will be a television ad for Excellence Hair Color debuting April 22. She has had a line of namesake perfumes since 2003, but this marks her first time fronting a major beauty brand. “I never saw that coming, especially at 51 years old,” Céline stated in a press release. “When you think I’m done, I’m just starting. I am finishing the shows at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. I am releasing a new English album and going on tour. And, my association with L’Oréal Paris is the beginning of a new amazing journey for me.” “I am now embracing myself and feel free to do what I want, where I want, when I want.” Go, Céline!
