President Muhammadu Buhari  has extended the tenure of acting Chief Justice of Nigeria Tanko Muhammad by three months. The National Judicial Council approved the appointment of Justice Muhammad following a recommendation sent by President Buhari. Muhammad was sworn in as the acting CJN on January 25 by Buhari after the president suspended Justice Walter Onnoghen as the Chief Justice of Nigeria following the directive of the Code of Conduct Tribunal. The first three months of Muhammad’s  tenure expires on April 25. A statement released by the NJC confirmed that it considered and approved the request for the extension of appointment sent by the president. It also debunked a report that the council would meet to decide on the extension of the acting CJN’s tenure. “The attention of the National Judicial Council has been drawn to an online newspaper and daily newspaper report stating that the council would meet next week to deliberate on the extension of the Acting Appointment of Honourable Dr. Justice I. T. Muhammad CFR, as the Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria,” the statement signed by Soji Oye, NJC spokesman, said. “Contrary to the above, the Council actually met on Thursday 18th April, 2019 and at the 88th Meeting considered and approved the request of President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, for the extension of the Appointment of Hon. Dr. Justice I. T. Muhammad, CFR, as the Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria for another three (3) months and Council has since forwarded its approval to the President.” Former CJN Onnoghen, on Thursday,  was convicted by the CCT on a six-count charge of false declaration of assets and was barred from holding any public office for the next ten years. Onnoghen has denied the charges and appealed the judgement. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
