Suspected gunmen, yesterday, killed no fewer than 11 persons at Ngibo and Tse Aye villages in Ikyurav-Tiev 1, Council Ward of Katsina-Ala Local Council of Benue State. A source said four persons were killed at Ngibo village, while seven were murdered at Tse Aye village. Also, 28 cows were rustled at Agwaza Atedze Farm by the suspected bandits. The Guardian learnt that the gunmen, who came on motorcycles, besieged the villages between 3a.m. and 4 a.m. However, there were two accounts on the attack. One has it that a wanted criminal suspect, Ghana Akwaza, might have been responsible, while the other said they were herdsmen. Confirming the incident, Benue State Police Command Public Relations Officer, DSP Sewuese Anene, said the DPO of Katsina-Ala Local Council sent in the report to the headquarters and the command had mobilised men to the area. The PPRO, however, could not confirm the causality figure as she said the command was still awaiting details. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
