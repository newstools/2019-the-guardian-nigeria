 [FILES] Governor Seriake Dickson  In a statement by his Special Adviser, Media Relations, Fidelis Soriwei, the governor stressed the need for all well-meaning Bayelsans and friends to pray for continued stability and peace in the state.He urged the people to seek divine direction, as the PDP embarks on the search for the next governor. However, the governor stressed that it was his prayers that the state was not handed over to a person who would have no regard for God’s authority.The governor said that his position on who succeeds him was firmly anchored on the belief that “God does not only give power but truly rules the affairs of men.” Expressing gratitude to the clergy and Bayelsans for their prayers and support in the past seven years, Dickson attributed his achievements in office to God’s mercy.While calling for more support, he reiterated his administration’s commitment to finishing well and strong, noting that the period left for the Restoration Team to round off its stewardship was long enough to do more for the state. His words: “I will not cease thanking God, the clergy and the good people of our state for the prayers, encouragement and support to me and my team.“We have achieved a lot in the past seven years because of your support and the mercies of God, despite the meaningless distractions to destabilise our state, adjudged to be the most stable in the Niger Delta. “But, as usual, let me call on all of us to use this Easter, which is a period for sober reflection, to continue to invite the presence of God in our state. We must not relent in our prayers because the enemies of our land are planning hard to destroy the peace and stability we have laboured to build.“But we have nothing to fear. They put their trust in chariots, weapons and connections in Abuja, but we trust in the Almighty God who has always saved us.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
