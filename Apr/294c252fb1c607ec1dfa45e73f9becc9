But clearing the air via a statement signed by the coordinator, Centre for Information, Press and Public Relations, Mr. Ademola Adekoya, the school affirmed: “Professor Peter Okebukola joined the service of Lagos State University transferring his service from the then Oyo State College of Education, Ilesa, and the date of birth on his Record of Service forwarded to the university by his former employer is February 17, 1951.” The university is bound to stand by that date because the Record of Service is the officially recognised record of his past service.“The affirmation of the date of birth of Professor Okebukola in the Record of Service forwarded to the university by the Oyo State College of Education, Ilesa confirmed the assertion by Okebukola that he was born on February 17, 1951. “Based on the foregoing and in compliance with the law and subsisting Conditions of Service guiding senior members of staff of the university as at 2015, Professor Peter Okebukola was due for retirement on February 17, 2016, being the date he attained the age of 65 years.
