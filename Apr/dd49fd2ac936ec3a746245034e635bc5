Witnesses said the army displayed a banner on one of the walls of their building facing the protesters. “Our brothers and sisters, don’t come close. You have been our guests under our protection. But now the emergency law governs all of us,” the banner said. Before his ouster last week, veteran president Omar al-Bashir imposed a state of emergency under which rallies were banned. The SPA described the attempt to disperse the crowds as “an indication that the military council will not fulfil its commitment given to the people,” in a separate statement on its Facebook page. Protest organisers have given a list of demands to the country’s new ruling military council that came to power after Bashir was removed from office. Their key demands include handing power to a transitional civilian government and bringing leaders of Bashir’s regime to justice, including the deposed president.
