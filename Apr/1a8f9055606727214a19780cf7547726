Just days after releasing their Game of Thrones-inspired track “Power Is Power,” Travis Scott, The Weeknd, and SZA are giving fans teaser photos from the medieval-themed music video. On Saturday, Scott shared an image of himself on Instagram standing in front of a dark grey Bentley wearing a wicked black breastplate with chainmail and dark leather pants. “House of Flame Son of lord Jacques B Webster the 1st Husband of the Goddess K– Protector of the Seven Kingdoms Blatt,” Scott captioned the photo. Meanwhile, SZA shared several images of herself wearing an ornate crown with multi-coloured jewels and a revealing red top. The Weeknd, a well-documented Game of Thrones fan, posted a photo of himself sitting on what appears to the show’s famous Iron Throne, which he captioned. “How I’m watching episode 2 tomorrow.” The star-studded For the Throne soundtrack, which coincides with the last season of the HBO series, will be released through Columbia on April 26. The soundtrack also features songs by Maren Morris, Ellie Goulding, The Lumineers, A$AP Rocky, Mumford & Sons, and X Ambassadors.
