 Abuja  The unseeded 20-year-old Added was businessman-like in the final against  his in-form countryman, Tom Jomby for the title. Added, who has enjoyed a rather smooth path to yesterday’s final, had conceded just one set at this week’s GSL Open – to second seed, Arjun Kadhe of India in the second round. He went on to beat Pedro Sorgi 7-5, 7-6 in the quarterfinals and Niels Lootsma 7-5, 6-4 in Saturday’s semifinals. America’s Peter Kobelt was a victim in the first round. Meanwhile, top seed, Sadio Doumbia, who could not survive unseeded Simon Yitbraket from Sweden in their quarterfinals encounter, is leaving Nigeria uncertain of participating in the tournaments next year, citing his ATP ranking. “I would love to come to Abuja next year, but my ATP ranking would determine,” said the 28-year Sadio Doumbia, who is currently ranked 387 on the ATP ladder. In the men’s doubles decided earlier, Added had paired Michail Pervolarakis of Greece to defeat the Indian pair of Arjuna Kadhe/Sundae Vijay Prashanth 6-4, 6-4.
