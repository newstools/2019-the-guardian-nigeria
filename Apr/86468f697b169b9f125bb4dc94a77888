On May 4, 1949, 18 players of the Torino football club, among the best in the world at the time, were killed along with 13 other people when their plane crashed into the Basilica of Superga, near Turin. It was the first such tragedy to strike the world of football. The ‘Grande Torino’ team had won five of their seven Serie A titles in the 1940s but struggled for decades after the tragedy. The match was moved because of strong pressure from Torino and the club’s fans. Juventus are top of Serie A and poised to seal an eighth consecutive Scudetto, with Torino in eighth position with six games to play.
