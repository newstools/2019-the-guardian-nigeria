The Lagos State government yesterday debunked news circulating on the social media that it had earmarked the Abraham Adesanya housing estate located in Ajah for demolition and rebuilding into a luxurious estate. Government also denied reallocating new houses to former landlords in the estate at a new location. In a letter signed by the permanent secretary, Lagos ministry of housing, Mrs. Olayinka Patunola-Ajayi, and addressed to the facility manager of the estate, the ministry said government is “proposing nothing like that” and urged all home owners/resident of the estate to disregard the information. The letter reads: “I am directed to discredit the fake news and let you know that the ministry is proposing nothing like that and that all home owners/residents are advised to disregard this information. You are by this letter, requested to allay the fears of homeowners/residents and stakeholders”. Also debunking the news, the Public Relations Officer of the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA), Titilayo Ajirotutu, who spoke with The Guardian on telephone, said there was no plan to demolish the estate. Abraham Adesanya Estate is the property of the Lagos State government leased to occupants. It is a middle-class residential estate where all houses are strictly commercial. According to investigation, following the purported news emanating from social media users some days ago alleging of plans by government to demolish the estate, some landlords had begun processes to sell off their buildings at cheap prices. Similar eviction notice scare also became public four years ago, which made many of the residents to panic. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
