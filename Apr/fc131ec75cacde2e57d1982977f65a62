 A girl feeling depressed from rape  The duo were arraigned before Chief Magistrate Peter Ojo on a five-count charge brought against them by the police. Their alleged offence bordered on conspiracy, attempted rape, assault, impersonation and threatening violence.
According to prosecution, their offences contravened Sections 411, 262, 170 (1), 380 and 56 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Okpanlanedu and Idongesit were said to have committed the offences on April 1, 2019 at Peace Land Hotel, Folagoro, Lagos at about 4:40p.m. The prosecution counsel, Sgt. Modupe Olaluwoye, told the court that the undergraduates promised to introduce the victim, a make-up artiste to a person who needed her services. They led her to a hotel room and attempted to rape her in the hotel room. Okpanlanedu told her he is an army personnel, and threatened to stab her with a knife he was holding, if she refuse to co-operate with them.

The knife was recovered from the crime scene, and we intend to tender it in evidence.” Following their plea of not guilty, Magistrate Ojo admitted them to bail in each of the sum of N200,000 with two sureties in like sum.
