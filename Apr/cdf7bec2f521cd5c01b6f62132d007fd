Lagos State Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, yesterday, received the UEFA Champions League Trophy alongside its Ambassador and former captain of Barcelona FC, Carles Puyol in Lagos. Ambode expressed excitement that the organisers of the tour considered Lagos as one of the states to visit, adding that the development was particularly gratifying more so that the synergy between sports and entertainment as well as tourism had been massively played up in the last four years. Ambode, represented by the Chairman of Lagos State Sports Commission, Dr Kweku Tandoh, also received Nigerian football legend, Austin JayJay Okocha, who was part of the delegation. The Governor also lauded the contribution of Puyol and Okocha to the development of football in Nigeria and worldwide, saying they deserved to be appreciated and celebrated. “I must say I am very pleased with the organisers of this Trophy Tour for deeming it fit to take the UEFA Champions League Cup to Lagos. We are particularly excited because our administration has focused on the synergy between sports, tourism, entertainment and the arts, among others and the people can see the positive effects of our efforts in that regard. “We are pleased to also welcome Barcelona FC and Champions League legend, Carles Puyol to Lagos, as well as our legend, JayJay Okocha to Lagos House. Many of us underrate this legend that we have and just yesterday, I understand Puyol had a very difficult time on the field of play in Uyo when Jay Jay had to give him a few tricks. “Unfortunately, JayJay did not get to play for Barcelona; he would have lifted the Champions League but I must say we appreciate what Okocha has done for Nigerian football.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
