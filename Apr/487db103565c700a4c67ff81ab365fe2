The Federal Government has signed a bilateral agreement on international education to give students access to study in over 70 public universities in Turkey. Already, an educational institute, Goodmus Learning Centre has been officially licensed to handle the admission process.Chief Executive officer of the centre, Badmus Adekunle told reporters in Lagos that the scholarship is aimed at reducing the huge cost of studying abroad by Nigerians in pursuit of higher education. Adekunle said: ”Based on the 90 percent scholarship, prospective students will pay subsidised fees. The tuition range is between #2OO and #985 euros for one academic session, medical courses inclusive. He called on the teeming prospective students to avail themselves of the opportunity, saying about 30 students benefited from the agreement last year.“Over thirty Nigerian students benefited from this offer last year and they are already in Turkey now. We brought the Turkish representatives into Nigeria last year to see how we conducted the examination. Professor of Veterinary Medicine, Uludag University, Turkey, Dr. llker Arican said the scholarship examination was done in over 21 countries including Europe, Asia and Africa.“After each examination, we set the cut off mark and once a student meets the requirement, such an applicant automatically qualifies for the scholarship” he said.Prof Arican added that about 15,000 students from across the world are expected to benefit from the scholarship scheme.“So far we have gotten 5, 000 students and hope to go on until our target is met” he stated.
