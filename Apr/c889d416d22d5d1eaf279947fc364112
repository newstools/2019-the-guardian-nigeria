The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, said the Nigerian government with security agencies “will leave no stone unturned in their efforts to apprehend the killers” of two tourist Faye Mooney and Matthew Oguche. Oguche a staff of the International NGO Safety Organisation and Mooney a British aid worker with Mercy Corps Nigeria, were killed by kidnappers while on a vacation at Kajuru Castle in Kajuru Local Government, Kaduna State. The minister described the killings at the resort as “a setback to efforts to promote tourism in the country.” “The dastardly attack that led to the death of Ms Faye Mooney, a British aid worker, and Mr Matthew Oguche, a Nigerian, while visiting the popular resort is a setback to efforts to promote tourism in the country,” Mohammed said in a statement on Tuesday. The minister also condoled with the families of the victims. He said the government would do everything possible to apprehend the killers and bring them to justice. Mohammed said the security agencies will also ensure that the three persons kidnapped in the attack were released unharmed. The minister said the Federal Government had stepped up efforts to curb the wave of violence and banditry in some parts of the country. “The government will not relent until all parts of the country are made safe for all, whether they are tourists, business people or ordinary Nigerians who just want to live under atmosphere of peace and security,” he added.
