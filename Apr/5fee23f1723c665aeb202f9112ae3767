Burna Boy performed for the second time on the main stage of the Coachella Music Festival on Easter Sunday 21st of April 2019 at Indio, California. LA Times described Burna Boy’s playing at Coachella as a way of “spreading the gospel.” “It’s good for people who haven’t heard me before to hear me,” Burna boy said, before his performance. “Africa is like the home of everything. It’s the beginning of everything,” he said. “So it’s like whether or not you directly listen to African music, you have listened to African Music.” – Burna Boy Read More: Watch: Kanye West Debuts “Water” At Coachella’s Sunday Service See pictures from the concert below:
