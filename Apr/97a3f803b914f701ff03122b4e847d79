Human right activist and former People’s Democratic Party aspirant for Kaduna State House of Assembly Ndi Kato has dumped the opposition party. “I wish to state that I do not belong to any political party at the moment and would love to focus on promoting political conversations, pushing for women inclusion and fighting for human rights,” kato said on Monday. “I’m taking a much-needed break from partisan politics,” she added. Kato, a 28-year-old female politician, declared her intention to contest for a seat in the Kaduna State House of Assembly in 2018 but couldn’t obtain the party’s ticket. Known for her active fight for women inclusion in politics in the Northern region of Nigeria, Kato said she would prefer to stay away from politics and committing to any political party. A former PDP social media strategist Deji Adeyanju said Kato leaving is a loss to the Nigerian opposition party. Adeyanju said the party disappointed Kato when she needed it the most. “PDP loses @YarKafanchan as she dumps party,” Adeyanju tweeted on Monday. “This young & smart lady gave her all to the party. Was on TV defending the party when her mother died. “None of the leaders of the party showed up at the burial. She ran for office as House of Assembly member, they denied her ticket.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
