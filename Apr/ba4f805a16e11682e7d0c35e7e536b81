Reality tv star Kim Kardashian is actively pursuing a career in Law, following in the footsteps of her late father Robert Kardashian Sr., who was one of the most prominent lawyers in America in his prime. On Wednesday, Vogue Magazine released its May cover story which featured Kim Kardashian where she revealed that she’s studying to become a lawyer with a four-year apprenticeship with a law firm in San Francisco, and plans on taking the bar exam by 2022. She also talks about her plans to further pursue criminal justice reform. Kardashian’s first political break came after her meeting with United States President Donald Trump, which led to the release of Alice Marie Johnson from prison. The fact that she was able to effect positive change through the proper channels made her want to take learning the intricacies of the law more seriously and thus pushing her to pursue a career in Law.
