Donald Glover has dropped his highly anticipated film with Rihanna during a Coachella performance by his rap alter ego Childish Gambino that could be one of his last. The star famous for his music but also successful in film, television and comedy delivered a pared down headlining performance heavy on dance but light on production to wrap the first night of the premier music festival set in the California desert on Friday. During his set, Glover’s 54-minute film “Guava Island” — a much-touted tropical thriller shot in Cuba and starring Rihanna — also began streaming on Amazon Prime.
