The Theatre Commander of Operation Lafiya Dole, Maj-Gen. Benson Akinroluyo has refuted report of an online news, alleging massive attacks in Konduga council by the troops, describing it as a purported move to cause panic among communities in Borno. The publication, according to him, was designed to cause “panic and pandemonium” within the insurgency affected communities of Konduga-Bama axis. Spokesman of Operation Lafiya Dole, Col. Ado Isa in a statement, yesterday, in Maiduguri said the alleged attacks were not only false, but was also to smear and discredit the image of military that is fighting Boko Haram insurgency in the northeast. He urged the public to disregard the publication, which he said was baseless and unsubstantiated to cause panic and terror among communities. Akinroluyo said Konduga remains peaceful, as the people go about their normal activities.
He urged the people to provide credible information on suspicious activities in their communities for prompt action.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
