Reality TV star, Kim Kardashian in a recent chat with CNN has stated that she will never use her privilege to help her kids get into college they could never get into on their own. While being questioned by CNN’s Van Jones on Sunday, the mother of three stated that doing such wouldn’t help anybody. “If they couldn’t get into a school, I would never want to use privilege to try to force them into a situation that they wouldn’t thrive in any way. So that’s where I just see that that’s not appropriate. I want my kids to be kind. I want them to be as grounded as possible. And to buy your way into something just wouldn’t benefit anybody”. Kardashian’s comment on “The Van Jones Show” is coming weeks after 50 people were charged by prosecutors in a sprawling conspiracy to game the college admissions system. According to reports, 33 wealthy parents including two prominent Hollywood actresses are alleged to have used their means to manipulate the admissions system and get their children into selective universities. It would be recalled that Kardashian recently announced that she is pursuing a law degree and hopes to have attained this by 2022. She also recently passed her first law exam and has since shut down critics who allege she bought her way in. According to her, she works hard like everyone else.
