 Dr. S. O. Onabanjo  Friends, do you know the story of resurrection and the Ultimate Victory Jesus Christ had over death and all satanic forces reflects our experience in life. Jesus Christ was born or manifested for a PURPOSE. (1 John 3:8). He came as the Son of Man (100% human) but Empowered by the Holy Spirit (Is.61: 1-10&Acts 10:38) to Redeem (Rescue) Humanity from eternal damnation. For Christ to fulfi His God-ordained assignment on earth, He paid the PRICE. He endured the shame and contradiction of men. He conquered rejection and persecution. (Heb.12: 1-5). He depended on the Holy Spirit. He had the authority to command legions of angels to come down and rescue Him, but He refused. That would have altered the original PLAN. Jesus Christ surrendered All at the Garden of Gethsemane. “Not my Will Lord, but your Will be Done.” (Matt.26: 39-40). He was not AFRAID to Die!! He ROSE triumphantly over and against Satan’s expectations and his cohorts. He took Hell by Storm and led captives and gave freedom to all men. (Eph.4: 8-9). Resurrection is the Outstanding Victory Jesus Christ had over Sin, Satan, Sickness and Death!! So, Child of God, be strong and Courageous. All things are working for your good if you Love God and Called according to His Purpose.
