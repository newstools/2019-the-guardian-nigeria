The 46-year old rapper who has once revealed that his drug addiction almost cost him his life shared a medallion XI,” and the words “ Unity,” “Service” and “Recovery.” He adds: “11 years – still not afraid.” It would be recalled that back in 2010, Eminem opened up about his abuse of pills. He said, “I used to get pills wherever I could. I was just taking anything that anybody was giving to me.” He also mentioned methadone as one of the prescription pills he abused which almost cost him his life. “Vicodin, Valium and Ambien, and toward the end, which caused my overdose, methadone.” The rapper however replaced addiction with exercise, which helped him a lot after he got out of rehab. “When I got out of rehab, I needed to lose weight, but I also needed to figure out a way to function sober. Unless I was blitzed out of my mind, I had trouble sleeping. So I started running. It gave me a natural endorphin high, but it also helped me sleep, so it was perfect.” In the past, Eminem who is one of the most successful rappers in music history has said that his greatest achievement is his daughter, Hailey.
