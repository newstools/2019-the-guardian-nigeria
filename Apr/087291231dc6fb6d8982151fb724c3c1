Photo/hotels  The claimant in the suit no LD/5324GCMW/18 asked the court to declare that Lagos State Government is the lawful owner of the property situated at no 6 Ikorodu road, Jibowu Yaba, which it has been a tenant for years. Chisco stated that by the virtue of the revocation of Certificate of Occupancy in respect of the property, the proprietary rights is vested in the state government.

Chisco wants the court to declare that claimant cannot forcibly eject or remove it from the said property, without following the due process of the law. In their statement of defence, defendants denied every allegation in statement of claim. They said that the defendants are not the administrators of real estate of the late Chief J.A Oyelowo the owner of the property comprising five bedroom detached and service quarters the subject matter of the suit. Defendants averred that claimant has been paying its rent severally and consequently since 1995 not 1996.
