This festival is borne out of love for the games. I have been a gamer for a very long time, having opened my first game shop way back in 2003. “This festival came on board when my partner sold the idea that we should together over this. Then I felt it was expedient to bring it back considering social vices in cyber crimes and the rest. We thought it would be best for us to bring back the old culture of being addicted to games where one, learns, develops his/her mind and have fun,” he stated.
