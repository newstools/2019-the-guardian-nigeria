 Burnt car along Oshodi expressway  The bus had gone up in flames in the evening of April 17, compounding the gridlock on the busy highway. Though no life was lost in the incident, it took the fire service stationed a few metres away at Toyota bus-stop over two hours to arrive at the scene with their fire fighting truck after the bus had been completely burnt. However, its abandonment has been a major concern to people plying the route. The bus carcass has been causing nuisance on the road and inhibiting the free flow of traffic. It could also serve as a hideout for hoodlums that are perpetrating evil in the area at night. Many had thought it would have been taken off the road as part of preparations for the president’s visit last week, but it was not to be especially since the president’s itinerary only included a section of the expressway connecting to the Airport Road, which was commissioned by President Muhammadu Buhari.
