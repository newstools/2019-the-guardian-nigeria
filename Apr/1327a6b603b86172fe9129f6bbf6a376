The Chief Executive Officer, Lagos Ferry Service, Mr. Paul Kalejaiye has attributed unconducive operational base, regulator report for deployment and wanting Governor Akinwunmi Ambode to commission, as reasons the four ferries and one car-barge procured by the state government for his agency had not been deployed about four months after they were received. Kalejaiye said once the hurdles are scaled, the 40 and 60-seater ferrieswould convey Lagosians across the state waterways. He promised that his agency would provide the best of service to passengers, to encourage more Lagosians to use the waterways. “We are presenting the best that is world-class standard, in terms of comfort and aesthetics. When inside our ferries, it is like inside a plane. Our ferries would be first choice for anybody plying our routes,” he said. He explained that the ferries would existing routes that are navigable, as some routes are not sailable because of shallow waters and non-availability of jetties. “Our ferries require 4-feet depth to remain afloat. So we are looking at navigable routes and they are the often used ones- CMS, Ikorodu, Apapa, Mile 2, Ojo and Badagry.” Speaking on the fare, Kalejaiye said water transport is never cheaper, though faster and more comfortable. “I have advised government to understand that subsidy on water transportation is for all. When you move people faster, you are boosting the economy. If the people are kept two to four hours on the road, it is like a stagnant economy because of the time lost,” he said.
