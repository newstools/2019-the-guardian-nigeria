 [FILE] Volleyball  The division two league was earlier scheduled to hold from March 27 to April 7, but it was postponed by the league management committee due to the international championships involving Nigeria in March. According to NVBF Technical Director, Martins Melandi, Nigeria will host the Zone Three Africa Club Championships and Africa Senior Beach Volleyball Championships from April 14 to 19 April in Lagos. Melandi said, “The Division two league has been moved to May due to the extension of club registration to March 31 and the hosting of two separate international championships. “The country will host the Zone 3 Africa Club Championships and Africa Senior Beach Volleyball Championships in April and we have to respect CAVB by shifting the local league. “After confirming the international tournaments for next month, we wrote to the clubs who showed interest of participating in the division two that there was a slight change of date.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
