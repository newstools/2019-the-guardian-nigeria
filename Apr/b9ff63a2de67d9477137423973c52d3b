Rivers State House of Assembly has approved the suspension of chairmen of 12 local councils of the state who were suspended by Governor Nyesom Wike last week for refusal to attend state functions. The suspension ratification followed a request by Wike to the lawmakers over his action, which many have condemned but he (Wike) in a letter of notification to the Speaker of the House, Ikuinyi Owaji-Ibani, premised his action on Section 64 (3) of the Rivers State Local Government Law No. 5 of 2018. The lawmakers, while debating on the matter during plenary, said the governorâ€™s action was in line with the laws made by the Assembly. Chairman of the House Committee on Local Government, Kelechi Nwogu, said the suspension of the council chairmen would serve as a deterrent to others who feel they are above the law.
