Between the ages of 17 and 18, Adesanya watched a film “Ong Bak: Muay Thai Warrior” starring Tony Jaa who was hailed as a martial arts star. “Ong Bak” rekindled his interest in sports and at 18, he trained in kickboxing.

Given his successful training, he fought at Hong Kong, Australia and China over the next five-and-a-half years and amassed a record of 11-0 in all matches. In December 2017, Adesanya signed with the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship). At his debut, he won against Rob Wilkinson via TKO in the second round, thereby earning him Performance of the Night bonus.
