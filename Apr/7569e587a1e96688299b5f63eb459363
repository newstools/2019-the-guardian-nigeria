International pop star, Britney Spears is reportedly being held against her will in rehab. This information is coming on the heels of an earlier report that she checked into a mental health facility where she has been for about 30 days. According to reports, her father’s recent ill health took a major toll on her as they are quite close. The stress caused doctors to adjust her medication because her former meds lost their efficacy. Shortly after her going into rehab, some fans and protesters gathered outside the West Hollywood City Hall in Los Angeles with signs that read “Free Britney” and “Truth Will Set Her Free.” The protest was inspired by rumors that she is being held against her will and it was live-streamed on YouTube, with attendees shouting, “Hey, ho, Larry Rudolph has got to go!” claiming it was her longtime manager’s decision to put the star in the facility. We reported earlier that her boyfriend, Sam Asghari, spotlighted their relationship in a collection of video clips posted on Instagram Saturday (April 13) in a move to show support for her while she underwent treatment. Spears herself on April 3 shared, “We all need to take time for a little ‘me time. Fall in love with taking care of yourself, mind, body, spirit.”
