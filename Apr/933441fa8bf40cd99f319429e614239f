Everyday you must remind yourself of how powerful and fabulous you are. The world needs you at your best, so daily positive affirmations are a must. So, today I am affirming and reminding you of your significance to this world. Your purpose, your strength, your emotions, your decisions, your style, and intelligence are highly needed. Everyday is and will be a stepping-stone into your magnificence. Your light cannot be threatened nor challenged when you do good and be good to others. It is the law of karma that you do not put out the light of someone else’s in order for yours to shine brighter. Two flames are better than one. Always understand that your place and position can never be filled. You will and always will be the leader, the creator, the innovator, the trendsetter, the influential, and much more because what is destined for you is unique and incomparable. There is no need to compare yourself; in time and in discovery you will find the match to blaze through the world. Every left turn and disappointment is a blessing, a gift, and most importantly a lesson. Do not be afraid to share your gift to the world. It is the law of attraction that as you give, whether it be in advice or in opportunity to others, it shall surely be given back to you. Every opportunity to shine, to stand out, to speak up, to use your platform for the upliftment of others must not be wasted. Your purpose is to use your gifts, talents, and skills in the form of service to others. It is true that there are those who may envy your light or you may appear to intimidate others-but understand it’s because they haven’t found their match to ignite their fire yet and maybe by the blossoming of your life it may give others the confidence to find their own flame.
