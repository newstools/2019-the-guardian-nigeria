We reported earlier last month that Davido was set to become the first Nigerian to appear on Comedy Central Roast in South Africa, an internationally acclaimed TV show. Comedy Central Roast is a popular American TV series that features a selected panel, made up of the celebrity’s peers as well as popular comedians, who comically trash the ‘honoured guest’ both personally and professionally. For Davido’s appearance, South African rapper, AKA was the roasted guest and as expected, Davido delivered some comic jibes. Ahead of his appearance on the show, Davido had said, “I’m such a big fan of Comedy Central, this is going to be a hilarious night. I’m ready, Africa are you ready? This is a Roast so nothing is off limits!” The 26-year-old singer during his roast session that had South African actress, Pearl Thusi as the Roast Master delivered some punchlines that at a point during the show, AKA joked about leaving by saying good night.
