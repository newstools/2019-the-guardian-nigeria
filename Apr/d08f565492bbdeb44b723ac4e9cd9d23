The Kaduna State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has appealed to the state government to release leaders of Adara community, who were arrested and detained in the wake of the Kajuru crisis, saying it is only in a just atmosphere that peace can be sustained. The state chairman of CAN, Reverend Joseph Hayab condemned continuous detention of Adara leaders, while urging government to work towards their release in order to promote peace among people in the troubled community. Hayab said: “There is this abuse of the rule of law going on in our country. If you claim to have arrested people or detained them because of a particular issue, then take them to court, so that they can be granted bail. But they were kept in detention for so long before being taken to court. “By this, you are only creating more tension. Releasing them is the best way to finding lasting peace among the people. They are being detained on allegation that has not been proven.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
