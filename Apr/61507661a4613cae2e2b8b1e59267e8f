As an online sports store, our desire here is to achieve the goal of being a store where quality is made king and customer service, queen, making sure that when orders are placed through our website which is www.naijasportsmarket.com or through our whatsapp platform, +2348150886716, we deliver ahead of time to show that in Nigeria, you can place orders online and get your ordered goods delivered as at when due. On his part, Nollywood’s finest veteran actor, Paul Obazele says that the opening of Naija Sports Market was a great debut outing, which proves that as people strive to be more active by engaging in sporty activities, they won’t say that because the National Stadium is too far from them, they will not engage their bodies anymore. Ozzmanic through the Naija Sports Market has brought in the kits you need closer to you, so, you go pick them up and hit the road with that exercise to keep fit. So, let us crash the Blood Pressure problem, the arthritis problem, let us truly show our wives, husbands, our children that we love them by staying healthy and this is what Naija Sports Market is opened to help us achieve. Speaking further on the need for regular exercise by Nigerians, Mr. Obazele said that our bodies are given to us by God, but God will not come down to help us take care of them. We need to really take care of our body and make it truly the temple of God, by keeping it clean spiritually and physically. A sick person he says cannot attract people to God, but a healthy person can. “I will not do business with you if I see that you a dying or if I notice that the moment I give you my money, the next you are dead, so, when people see that you are healthy, they get easily attracted to you naturally and this is what I believe Ozzmanic’s Naija Sports Market seeks to achieve at this time.
