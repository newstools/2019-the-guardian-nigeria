 Ikeja Electricity Distribution Company  According to the residents, an attempt to meet with officials of IE to sort out their complaints about what they termed crazy billing has resulted to a backfire from the company. They alleged that the community was being punished for questioning the decisions of the company by reducing power given to the area to barely four hours a day. A resident, Solomon Ajani, has therefore decided to petition the Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, about the community’s plight from the disco. Ajani said “instead of providing us with prepaid meters, Ikeja Electric installed a ‘breaker’ with a timer to trip-off the community from the main supply and programmed to supply us only four hours of electricity daily while the estimated bills have increased from an average of N28,000 monthly to N70,000.” The community has send out an SOS call to appropriate bodies to look into the hike in bills and reduction in the power supply in the area. Meanwhile, an Epe Magistrates’ Court sitting in Lagos yesterday sentenced one Yesiru Suleman to three years imprisonment on a three-count charge of stealing, tampering and malicious damage to electricity equipment belonging to Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC).
