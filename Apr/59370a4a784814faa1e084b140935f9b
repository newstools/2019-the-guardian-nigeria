Akindoju said the three-legged events would be the first time it would hold under the new ITF World Tour format introduced in March 2017 and implemented this year. According to Akindoju, the Tombim Abuja Open, which is in its fifth edition, will be the first leg and will run from today to April 14; the Dayak Championship, the second leg, would be from April 15 to 21, while the GSL Open, third and final leg, is expected to run from April 22 to 28, featuring single and double matches. “The competition has five ATP points up for grabs each week for the winner, three points for the finalist, and one each for the semifinalists. The tournaments will also be played under the new ITF format that has seen a change from duration of six days to seven days. This is to facilitate improved player scheduling and avoid the current overlap in tournaments (where typically the qualifying competition in one tournament will begin before the final of the previous week’s tournament). “Previously, the qualifying round for a tournament will start on Saturday with the main draw starting on Monday and ending on Saturday. With the new format, the tournaments will run from Monday to Sunday, including qualifying, will have 32 players in the main draw,” Akindoju said. Already, entries have been received from players from 21 countries, including the United States of America, United Kingdom, Russia, Venezuela, Canada and Brazil. Other countries include Uzbekistan, India, Argentina, South Africa, Croatia, Spain, Zimbabwe, Uganda, France, Togo, Moldova, Kenya, Ghana, Zambia and Germany.
