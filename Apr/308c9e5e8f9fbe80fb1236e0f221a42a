Prince Estate and Warner Bros. Records have announced, today, the upcoming release of an album of 14 unreleased demos by the late rock icon. The album is a testament to Prince’s abundant musical output, chronicling the material he wrote and recorded for a number of protege bands and other artists. Its focus is 14 songs Prince wrote for other artists, including Apollonia 6, The Time, The Bangles, Sheila E., Vanity 6, Kenny Rogers and Martika. Originals — whose tracks were selected by Troy Carter on behalf of the Estate and Jay-Z — will begin streaming exclusively on TIDAL for two weeks beginning June 7, before Warner Bros. releases the collection on all download and streaming partners and CD on June 21. A 180s gram 2-LP and limited-edition deluxe 2CD-2LP format will follow on July 19, Billboard reports. “In addition to releasing nine of his most commercially successful full-length albums, he also wrote and recorded endless reels of material for proteges The Time, Vanity 6, Sheila E., Apollonia 6, Jill Jones, the Family, and Mazarati,” reads a release announcing the project.
