A medical practitioner in Imo State, Harold Onumo, has rejected an appointment by Governor Rochas Okorocha. Okorocha had on April 5, 2019 appointed and inaugurated Onumo (in absentia) as Board Chairman, Imo State Agency for Control of HIV/AIDS, (SACA). But speaking to The Guardian in Owerri yesterday Onumo, a former President General, Imo Youth Assembly, said there was no basis for him to accept Okorocha’s offer after impoverishing Imo people through his administration’s harsh policies and programmes. He also cited the alleged unfair treatment of medical practitioners in the state’s owned health institutions by the Okorocha’s government as part of reasons for rejecting the appointment. His words: “Okorocha’s government is a failed government and since inception eight years ago, it has openly shown disdain for due process and I do not think I will want to associate myself with such a government at any level whatsoever.
