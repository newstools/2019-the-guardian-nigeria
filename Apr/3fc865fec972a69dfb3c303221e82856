 Director General, Consumer Protection Council (CPC), Babatunde Irukera  The enforcement team stormed the market following intelligence from the Nigerchin sales team that the market was full of substandard cables. Administrative head of the company, Gerald Duruemeruo, said the adulterated products had been in the market for long, hence the action. During the operation, several fake cable products packaged with Nigerchin labels without Nigeria Industrial Standards (NIS) numbers were seized by the enforcement team, which confirmed that the market patronised adulterated cable products. “Our product has more weight than the adulterated ones because our cable is 100m long while the fake ones are 80m or less. Also, our cable is made of copper and aluminum conductors, which make them high in standard and quality,” Duruemeruo added.
