Johnny Depp is suing his former wife Amber Heard for $50 million (₦18 billion) in a defamation lawsuit. Depp, 55, has filed the lawsuit in relation to an op-ed piece Amber, 32, wrote for the Washington Post in December 2018, in which she spoke about her experiences of being a victim of domestic abuse. While Depp wasn’t specifically mentioned in the piece, the actor’s legal team has claimed that the article’s implication was that Depp ‘perpetrated domestic violence against her’ – allegations he ‘categorically’ denies. In court documents obtained by The Blast, Depp’s team say, “Ms. Heard purported to write from the perspective of ‘a public figure representing domestic abuse’ and claimed that she ‘felt the full force of our culture’s wrath for women who speak out’ when she ‘spoke up against sexual violence.'”
