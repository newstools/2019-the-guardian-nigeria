The Director, Korean Cultural Centre in Nigeria, Su Jin Lee believes the future of taekwondo in the country is bright, saying the country would soon become a top contender in the sport at the Olympics and global stage. Lee, who assumed duty barely a month ago as Director at the Korean Cultural Centre, said the document he met in the office informed him that Nigeria has great potentiality in taekwondo if the talents discovered at the Centre were properly developed. Speaking yesterday at an ongoing developmental programme at the Korean Cultural Centre in Nigeria, Lee said from the document he met on assumption of duty, the coach Abdulmalik Mohammed-led technical crew have discovered young talents that are capable of flying the country’s flag high at the Olympics and global scene if properly managed. Other members of the Nigerian technical crew at the Centre were Samuel Akande, Michael Akande, Abdulmalik Seidu and Chukwunonso Nnaji. Lee said he would seek clearance from his home government to stage a national championship to assess the strength of the young taekwondoists discovered at the Centre, adding, however, that the Centre would encourage the development of the martial art in the country. After watching some youngsters, including Ikechukwu Chizea, Kanitochukwu Adige, Ndubuisi Chizea, Mieto Lawal and Amarachikali Adigwe, demonstrate their skills at the Centre’s Dojan in their various grading categories, Lee said, “There are good talents here, and they could be world beaters if properly managed after here.” The Centre is currently having over 80 young taekwondoists. Also speaking at the event, Coach Abdulmalik Mohammed said the oldest among the students was 15 years and that efforts were being made to monitor the talents. “Our handicap is finance to stage various categories of tournaments where the progress of the talents discovered could be monitored,” Mohammed said.
