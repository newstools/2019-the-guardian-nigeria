Singer and songwriter Aituaje Aina Vivian Iruobe, better known as Waje, has said she may quit music due to lack of funds to promote her work, especially her latest Red Velvet. “Maybe it is fair to give it a rest and try other things. I can’t have released an album after everybody has been shouting Waje your last Album was five years ago, all the people that were shouting, where are they,” Waje said in a 12-minute-video posted to her YouTube channel And Twitter handle on March 20. <img class="size-full wp-image-886938 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53493095_250893642484481_2269928229290953236_n1.jpg" alt="" width="747" height="934" /> “I don’t have money for publicity, Emerald school fee is there. I have ten things laid out for me and every single time its always my music that is taking the bulk of the money.” The mother of one said she would rather put her money in other business than invest in music that isn’t helping her financial needs. While her decision to dump singing may have been well thought out, it seems to have been quickened by the opinion of someone who was constantly referred to as ‘he’ in the video and bad sales.  “What he is saying is not wrong,” she told a friend on phone in the video before adding that “it is not about his opinion.” Waje released her most highly anticipated second album Red Velvet in 2018, five years after her debut album Waje. She said she was not impressed with the low monetary turnout from the album and was disappointed because people demanded her to release it. The album Red Velvet is a melange of the singer’s diverse styles, streamlined and tailored around the central theme of love. Waje’s retirement will be a huge loss to the entertainment industry as there are few women in the industry. However, it is not expected that she will quit the entertainment industry totally. She was cast in a movie recently premiered along with her close pal Omawumi. She Is, the movie, was produced by Hermanes Media, a production outfit Waje and Omawumi founded. Hermanes Media to provides services such as film/TV production, TV adverts, content curation, brand event activation, and creative digital marketing. But apart from Music Waje has a foundation Safe House, through which she collaborates with different non-governmental organisations on their projects. The foundation was launched on October 1, 2012, and has assisted NGOs such as Mental and Environmental Development Initiative for Children (MEDIC) and Child Life Line. She has also donated to orphanages in Nigeria and Kenya in association with a corporate organisation.
