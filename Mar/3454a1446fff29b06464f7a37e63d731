Nigerian-British actor David Oyewolo has stated his interest in becoming the first black James Bond. This he believes will give black children “a superhero to identify with.” The actor who broke boundaries after becoming the first black actor to play king in Shakespeare’s Henry VI in 2001 said, ‘The significance of someone like me playing a role like James Bond is not lost on me. It is going to be something that will expand horizons. ‘One of the most beautiful things I have seen in America on Halloween is white kids running around in Black Panther costumes. I did not have a superhero to identify with growing up on a council estate in Islington. It was all Superman. That these things are very important is not lost on me.’ To see that this is achieved, he intends speaking with James Bond producer Barbara Broccoli. It should be recalled that in 2015, James Bond actor Daniel Craig’s indication that he was no longer interested in playing the British cool spy agent sparked rumours on who will take his place. For a long time, Idris Elba’s name was the favourite amidst the speculations. It was not until it was confirmed that Craig will be returning for Bond 25 that the rumour began to fizzle out.
