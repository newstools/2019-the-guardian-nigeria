 [FILE PHOTO] Act of rape  Oyedeji, a consultant at the Mirabel Centre made the revelation yesterday at the trial of Emmanuel Idoko, a 37-year-old commercial motorcyclist, for allegedly sexually assaulting his daughter with his fingers. While being led in evidence by A.O. Alagbe, the state prosecutor, he said Idoko’s daughter was referred to Mirabel Centre by the Divisional Police Officer of Ketu Police Station on November 28, 2017. He hinted that the client declared in her history that her father though not married to her mother, had her and her brother living with him, adding that her ordeal started in 2016. According to Oyedeji, the victim narrated that her father came home on a particular day and insisted that he heard from people that she was no longer a virgin and he needed to test her to see if it was true. “He forced her to undress and said he would use his finger to test her. He also said that he would use his penis to examine her and she refused. He beat her and subsequently started torturing her because she kept turning down his requests.” Oyedeji said Idoko’s daughter revealed that she was given soft drinks by her father, which made her fall asleep whenever she drank them. “She usually felt uncomfortable whenever she woke up in the morning. It was her sleepy nature that called the attention of her teacher who wanted to know why she was always sleeping in school. She had to reveal her ordeal to the class teacher. The father was arrested, and she was taken to a shelter, run by a non-governmental organisation.” The offences contravene Section 261 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Judge Sybil Nwaka adjourned the case until April 3 for a continuation of trial.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
