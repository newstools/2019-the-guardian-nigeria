Apart from make-up, tying your gele is another problem so many women face. You might not call it a problem but not everyone wants to just tie a gele like someone going for a prayer meeting – you really have to do it well. Let’s do this. Who must have seen the auto-gele somewhere, somehow. It has the prefix ‘auto’ because the idea is to do it once and make it permanent. So, you do not have to go through the stress over and over again. It is perfect for cultural dresses. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-871643 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Toju-Foyeh-wearing-a-rose-gele-PHOTO-Instagram-e1551634054862.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1506" /> For women who might not want to wear an Ankara or a laced dress, the rose gele is just the right thing to wear. It fits in quite naturally.
The flowery umbrella gele is a multi-friendly kind. You could wear it either with your cultural dress or your print dress. However, the dress must have
designed quite well. You don’t want your head gear outshining your dress. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-871642 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Temi-JTO-Otedola-in-a-two-toned-butterfly-gele-PHOTO-AccelerateTv.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1391" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Temi-JTO-Otedola-in-a-two-toned-butterfly-gele-PHOTO-AccelerateTv.jpg 920w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Temi-JTO-Otedola-in-a-two-toned-butterfly-gele-PHOTO-AccelerateTv-550x598.jpg 550w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Temi-JTO-Otedola-in-a-two-toned-butterfly-gele-PHOTO-AccelerateTv-487x529.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Temi-JTO-Otedola-in-a-two-toned-butterfly-gele-PHOTO-AccelerateTv-221x240.jpg 221w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Temi-JTO-Otedola-in-a-two-toned-butterfly-gele-PHOTO-AccelerateTv-442x480.jpg 442w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Temi-JTO-Otedola-in-a-two-toned-butterfly-gele-PHOTO-AccelerateTv-552x600.jpg 552w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> For free-styling, the two-toned butterfly gele is just the right thing to wear. It kind of reminds you of the foju soko gele. Don’t wear this unless you are wearing a cultural dress please. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-871639 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Liz-Dasilva-wearing-infinity-gele-PHOTO-Instagram-1001x1152.jpg" alt="" width="1001" height="1152" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Liz-Dasilva-wearing-infinity-gele-PHOTO-Instagram-1001x1152.jpg 1001w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Liz-Dasilva-wearing-infinity-gele-PHOTO-Instagram-520x598.jpg 520w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Liz-Dasilva-wearing-infinity-gele-PHOTO-Instagram-484x557.jpg 484w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Liz-Dasilva-wearing-infinity-gele-PHOTO-Instagram-968x1114.jpg 968w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Liz-Dasilva-wearing-infinity-gele-PHOTO-Instagram-209x240.jpg 209w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Liz-Dasilva-wearing-infinity-gele-PHOTO-Instagram-417x480.jpg 417w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Liz-Dasilva-wearing-infinity-gele-PHOTO-Instagram-521x600.jpg 521w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Liz-Dasilva-wearing-infinity-gele-PHOTO-Instagram.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px" />
