According to the NCDC, so far, sixteen deaths with CFR of 7.5 per cent have been recorded among all suspected cases and in the last four weeks, no LGA is in the alert threshold.A breakdown of the figures on CSM by the NCDC showed 213 total cases were reported with 16 deaths in 21 confirmed cases and 79 samples were tested out of 109 total samples collected. The NCDC said the multi-agency CSM EOC has been activated and the National Technical Working Group for Cerebrospinal Meningitis has been monitoring cases and ensuring preparedness and coordination of response across the states.Also, the NCDC has reported 103 suspected cases of yellow fever. According to the centre, three new presumptive positive cases were recorded: NCDC Central Public Health Laboratory (CPHL) reported the three new presumptive cases with two from Ovia South West and Esan North East LGAs of Edo State and one in Ose LGA of Ondo State.
