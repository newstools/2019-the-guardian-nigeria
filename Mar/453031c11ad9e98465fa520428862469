Spokesman of the command Bala Elkana said the Command’s anticrime monitoring unit arrested the fuel thief last Thursday when it suspected that the vehicle in which the stolen petrol was being transported looked suspicious. The vehicle, a Fiat bus had two contrasting colours: painted in Lagos commercial colour at the front while the rest was painted in blue. “On sighting the policemen, the three occupants of the Bus jumped down and fled in different directions. The policemen chased them and caught up with one of them, Wasiu Oyewole of No 3 Oluwaseyi Street, Agodo Egbe, Lagos, while the remaining two jumped into the carnal and escaped. “The suspect confessed that he and his cohorts loaded the FIAT Bus with registration Number LND 825 BC with multiple sacks laden with PMS  or  Petrol. “He claimed further that NNPC pipeline busted in Owutu area of Agric in Ikorodu where the products were loaded, while their intended sales point is Ijegun. “Efforts are being made to track down other accomplices who jumped off the vehicle on sighting the police. Meanwhile, NNPC officials have been contacted to take the products,” Elkana said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
