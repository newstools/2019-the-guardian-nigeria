Most of ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) of the federal government are still without active websites, Dr Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, director-general, National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), has said. Pantami, who made this known at the Stakeholders’ Engagement on Nigerian Government Enterprise Architecture (NGEA) which held in Abuja, said only 4.72 percent of the country’s MDAs could boost of interactive and very active websites that could offer complete transactions online on the services they offer.

’The effect of these is obvious resulted in the inability of public institutions to fully translate national or their vision, policies, programs, plans and strategies into effective enterprise change and public value. ‘’This has prevented IT, to some extent, from becoming an asset shaping strategic future opportunities of public institutions and the Government as a whole. The implication and consequence of all these is high rate of IT projects failures’’, Dr Pantami said. He said out of 106 MDAs surveyed by the agency, only 4.72 % of them were at the enhanced and connected stages of United Nations’ e-Government maturity model respectively.  ‘’The interpretation of this is that most of the FPIs have interactive websites that cannot offer complete transactions online for a service’’, the NITDA boss said. However, he said, despite the above scenario, the country had experienced some possibilities in ICT adoption which were evident in the Treasury Single Account (TSA), Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System (IPPIS) etc.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
