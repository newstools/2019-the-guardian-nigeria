Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are either launching a new product or signing endorsement deals; their latest project tweaks the idea of a lemonade stand, for a good cause. On Friday (March 22), West, Kardashian and their children — along with sister Khloé Kardashian, her baby daughter True and Kourtney Kardashian’s daughter, Penelope — broke out the paintbrushes and set about creating a roadside pop-up shop.

Adidas, West’s partner in Yeezy, were on board as well and all worked with families across the country to host similar stands. All proceeds from the Yeezy stands are directed towards the National Alliance on Mental Illness.
