The Chairman of the Agency, Olayinka Egbeyemi, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP) disclosed this today during an enforcement operation on motorcyclists operating on restricted routes around Ikeja, Ojota, and Maryland. CSP Egbeyemi disclosed further that out of 115 motorcycles impounded today during the enforcement operations, 22 were branded commercial ‘Gokada and Maxokada’. He confirmed that activities of these newly branded commercial motorcycle operators are illegal and without any valid documentation from the state government. Egbeyemi reiterated that in accordance with the law, no commercial motorcycle operator is allowed to operate on 475 restricted routes including highways and bridges across the state. “The government enjoined members of the public to henceforth desists from patronising commercial motorcyclists on all restricted routes as passengers are as well liable for prosecutions” “It was an eye-sore seeing operators of these newly branded commercial motorcycles (Gokada/Maxokada) competiting for right of ways with motorists on highways and bridges across the state.” Egbeyemi, however, stated that the Lagos state Commissioner of Police, CP Zubairu Muazu, has directed that 10 arrested riders be immediately charged to court for prosecution. One of the arrested ‘Gokada’ rider, Mr Ayeni Francis, who claimed to be paying N3,000 per day to the authorities said they were not aware of any documentation with the government.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
