 [FILE PHOTO] Gov. Abdulaziz Yari of Zamfara  The ALL Progressives Congress (APC) might have forfeited its win of the Zamfara State governorship election to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).This followed a ruling yesterday by the Court of Appeal in Sokoto, which nullified the party’s primaries in the state.
  
The verdict came two weeks after the party’s candidate, Mukhtar Shehu, was declared winner.It set aside the judgment delivered by a Zamfara High Court, which had allowed the APC to field candidates in the elections.Senator Kabiru Marafa, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Petroleum (Downstream) and 129 others filed the appeal through their counsel, Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) Mr. Mike Ozhekome.
  
Delivering the lead judgment, which was adopted by two other justices, Tijjani Abubakar and Jamilu Tukur, yesterday, Justice Yakubu held that the lower court failed to properly evaluate the evidence before it. He said judges have the legal power to produce judgment and reach decisions with reason. He regretted that in this case, that was not done.
