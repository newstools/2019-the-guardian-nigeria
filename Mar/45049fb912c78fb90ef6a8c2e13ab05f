Community Court of Justice (CCJ) and staff of ECOWAS court in collaboration with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Wednesday, 6th March 2019 began a two-day training workshop on International Humanitarian Law (IHL) in Abuja. IHL is also called the law of war or the law of armed conflict. The workshop is organised to deliberate and addresses many cases related to breaches of international law in line with its human rights mandate. Five court judges and more than 20 staff drawn mainly from the Court’s registry and the research and documentation department are participating in this year’s workshop. The workshop focuses on developing the role and expertise of the judges in the application of IHL and improve the understanding of the staff of the legal framework to better support the judges. The workshop introduced the participants to IHL, protection of health care and access to health care, use of force in military and security operations and applicable rules for detention in armed conflict. “As a number of countries in West Africa are dealing with armed conflicts, it is more important than ever for judges from our Community Court of Justice to strengthen their understanding of international humanitarian law,” Justice Edward Amoako Asante, President of the Court said of the workshop.
