Kendall Jenner is such a braveheart! After unveiling what appears to be her new pet – a white snake- with a video clip on her Instagram Story, she wasn’t afraid to let the serpent crawl all over her body — including her head! The supermodel and Keeping Up with the Kardashians star shared a video of her snake twirling around her messy high bun as it looked almost like a ’90s hair scrunchie as it twisted around the hairdo. Jenner is such an animal-loving star; she is also a dog mom to a Doberman Pinscher, which she often shows off on Instagram (though she has yet to reveal its name). Take a look at her new pet below:   <img class="aligncenter lazyload" src="https://ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/5Z1ktktTURBXy9iMTUzNjM0OS0zNTMxLTQ5NzItOGZiYy03ZDE0NTRhNDJkNGMucG5nkpUCzQMUAMLDlQIAzQL4wsM" alt="Kendall Jenner Instagrams Her Pet Snake In Her Hair " />
