Beyoncé and JAY-Z are well known for using their platform to help people in disavantaged situations, and now they’ll be receiving the Vanguard Award at the 30th Annual GLAAD Media Awards. The event will take place in Los Angeles on March 28th, 2019, and while it’s unclear if The Carters will make an appearance, the award will celebrate their support to the LGBTQ community. “Beyoncé and JAY-Z are global icons and passionate defenders of human rights and acceptance for all people,” GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said as Variety reports. “When Beyoncé and JAY-Z speak, the world becomes inspired and when it comes to LGBTQ people, their voices of acceptance have been heard loud and clear.” Both of the artists are being celebrated for their outspoken stance on marriage equality as well as their continued efforts for inclusivity in their work.
