NSCDC The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in Ekiti State has arrested a 52-year-old Dennis Agya Kiyeye for allegedly impregnating and attempting to murder his 15-year-old niece (names withheld) at Ilupeju Ekiti in Gboyin Local Government Area of the state. The NSCDC state commandant, Solomon Iyamu, said Kiyeye confessed that his niece has been living with him since 2013 after the demise of her mother in Benue State. “Kiyeye said he had been having carnal knowledge of the victim for the past three years and the act has become normal between them. The incestuous relationship resulted into pregnancy in 2016, but was kept secret with the help of a quack midwife who assisted in terminating the pregnancy. “The suspect explained that the girl got pregnant for him again, and due to the shame, he conspired to terminate her life in a nearby bush in the village, but luck came the victim’s way as she was rescued by a good Samaritan who reported the act to the village head of the community.” The village head, Chief Adebisi Olaoye, confirmed the claim that Dennis was arrested by the people while attempting to kill the girl. He promised to support the NSCDC on its investigations to unravel the mystery. The NSCDC commandant enjoined parents to take adequate care of their girl-child against wicked relatives pretending to be family members. The victim said her inability to reject her uncle’s sexual advances was because he was responsible for her feeding and upkeep. “He feeds and sheltered me and any attempt to refuse may result to hunger, punishment and deprive me of education.” She, therefore, cried to Non-Governmental Organizations and well-meaning Nigerians to come to her rescue as medical examination showed that she has fibroid tumour that is growing along with the baby, which may hinder the development of the fetus.
