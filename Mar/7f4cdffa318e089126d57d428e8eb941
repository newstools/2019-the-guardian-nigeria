The Secretary General of FIFA will be here to receive an award; just as the class of 1994 Nations Cup winners and the first Nigerian team to feature at the World Cup will be honoured specially. “Also, the outgoing and incoming governors of Lagos State will also receive awards,” he said. Akinwunmi disclosed that the NFF learnt a lot from the maiden edition, adding, “this year’s award will be strictly what it is meant for. “The ceremony will begin at 6:30 p.m. with the red carpet and that will be on until latest 7.15 pm while the door will close by exactly 7:20 pm. There won’t be any African time.” He disclosed that D’banj and Timi Dakolo, among other musicians, will be on stage to perform at the award ceremony. Also speaking at the event, AITEO’s General Manager, Mr. Taiye Eyewuoma reaffirmed his firm’s commitment to its contract with the NFF. “AITEO is committed to the sponsorship of the award. We are glad that the partnership is receiving the attention it deserves and we will continue to support the NFF in line with the agreement. “We are happy with what the NFF is doing. We are happy when the country is happy and that is why we will try in our little own way to bring joy to the country,” he said.
