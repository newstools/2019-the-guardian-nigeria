 OPEC Headquarters, Vienna  Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s largest producer, has made good on its pledge to lead the coalition by example, slashing its output to 10.15 million b/d in February, the survey found. That is 160,000 b/d below its quota of 10.31 million b/d and the kingdom’s lowest output level since May 2018.Energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, has signalled that the kingdom may go even lower in March, to 9.8 million b/d.
  
Venezuela, whose oil production has been declining for years due to underinvestment, technical problems and labor issues, pumped 1.10 million b/d in February, down 60,000 b/d month on month, as it has struggled to sell its crude since US sanctions were imposed in late January.At the end of February, Venezuela had 10.8 million barrels of crude sitting dockside without a buyer. The country’s output is down 910,000 b/d in two years and the lowest since an industry strike in late 2002 and early 2003, according to Platts survey data, with analysts projecting further erosion due to the sanctions.
  
Iran managed to keep production steady in February, at 2.72 million b/d, the survey found, as several buyers in the month took advantage of sanctions waivers the US granted to eight countries to purchase Iranian crude.The waivers expire in May, and the Trump administration has not provided any indication whether they will be extended or amended. Iraq produced 4.67 million b/d in February, according to the survey, 160,000 b/d above its quota.The country has consistently lagged in compliance with its committed cap, both under the current deal and under the previous accord, which ran from 2017 to 2018. Iraqi officials have sought exemptions from the deal, saying their war-torn country needs oil revenues to rebuild from its devastating fight against the Islamic State. But other members have pressured the country — largely to no avail — to conform with its quota.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
