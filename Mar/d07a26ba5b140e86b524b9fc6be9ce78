Jordan Peele’s new horror film Us hit theatres on Friday, March 22, and it’s already breaking box office records. Us raked in over $70 million at U.S. box offices during its opening weekend, making it the No. 2 opening of the year, after Captain Marvel, Variety reports. But that’s not the only impressive title awarded to the film; with its ticket sales, Us now holds the record for the third biggest opening for a horror film, along with the No. 1 slot at the box office for an original horror movie. In an interview with NPR, Peele said: “Everybody thinks of the term ‘us’ in different ways — it can be ‘us’ the family, ‘us’ the town, ‘us’ the country, ‘us’ humanity. I think in the simplest form, the very nature of ‘us’ means there is a ‘them,’ right? So that is what this movie is about to me, is that: Whatever your ‘us’ is, we turn ‘them’ into the enemy — and maybe ‘we’ are our own worst enemy”. Given the success of Peele’s directorial debut, Get Out, it’s only expected that Us opened in the same fashion. Watch the official trailer of Us below:
