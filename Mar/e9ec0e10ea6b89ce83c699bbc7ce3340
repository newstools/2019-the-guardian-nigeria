The move was to discuss impact and opportunities for key stakeholders within the Nigerian and British business communities in relations to trade in the coming months. The meeting, organized by the British Commission, was aimed at enlightening stakeholders on preemptive steps to be taken in positioning their businesses and taking the lead with great advantages the Brexit has to offer. It also availed member partners and businesses networking opportunities as it was well attended by dignitaries such as the Deputy High Commissioner Laure Beaufils, Country Head, Common Wealth Enterprise Investment Council (CWEIC), Obinna Anyanwu, and Ambassador Chinedu Osakwe, among others.
