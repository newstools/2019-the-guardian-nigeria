Former President Goodluck Jonathan rewrote his name in gold when at the height of the tensions building ahead of the 2015 general elections, he said: “My political ambition is not worth the blood of any Nigerian citizen.” His global stature was further enhanced when he not only ‘talked the talk but walked the walk’ by conceding defeat in a historic call to the winner, President Muhammadu Buhari, hours before the official declaration of the election outcome. Four years after, in another round of general election, it is a harvest of killings and violence across the country that trailed last Saturday’s governorship and state Houses of Assembly elections.
