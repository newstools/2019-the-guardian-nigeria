Viacom’s MTV has unveiled Seville, Spain, as the host city of the 26th annual MTV Europe Music Awards. The event is scheduled to take place at the city’s FIBES Conference & Exhibition Center on Sunday, November 3. This means the European MTV awards show will happen in Spain for the second year in a row after Bilbao hosted it last year following the 2017 edition in London. Raffaele Annecchino, president and managing director of Viacom International Media Networks Southern & Western Europe, Middle East and Africa, said: “We’re tremendously excited to be hosting the MTV EMAs in Spain for the fourth time and to be working in partnership with Seville. It is the first Creative City of Music to be recognized by UNESCO and has become one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. The city is a highly recognized center of creativity and musical activity, a vibrant environment that is the result of a long music tradition and influence on a global scale.” The 2018 edition saw big wins for Camila Cabello, who got the best artist award, among others — Nicki Minaj, Janet Jackson, Dua Lipa and Cardi B — alongside standout performances by Bebe Rexha, Spanish star Rosalia and host Hailee Steinfeld. The show, first held in Berlin in 1994, traditionally airs across MTV’s TV, social and digital platforms live.
