She owed her fans an explanation and took to Twitter and Instagram to speak on the issue. “Why would an artist cancel a show & lose money?” she wrote. “What for? When they’re already in the building, dressed, etc. The artist is just as mad as the fans when a show can’t go on. I love seeing my fans. Nothing can stop me. B4 the show, juice WRLD & I are just as excited as u guys are.” Why would an artist cancel a show & lose money? What for?

I’m more excited than you are before the show. “These two cities that had technical issues were cities that I’d never been to before, and we tried to add them, but they just didn’t have the power in the building to facilitate my show. And they didn’t tell us that until three hours before the show, as opposed to once we did soundcheck and they said it was fine.”   ♥ A post shared by  Barbie® (@nickiminaj) on Mar 9, 2019 at 4:13pm PST She, however, promised to make it up to them.
