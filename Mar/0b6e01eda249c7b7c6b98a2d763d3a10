Fans of “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” are suggesting that the cheating scandal involving Tristan Thompson, Jordyn Woods and Khloe Kardashian may have been a hoax. This is coming on the heels of the new 90-second trailer for “Season 16” which shows Khloe talk about the scandal. Recall that the scandal started after a video showing Khloe’s baby daddy and NBA player and Kylie Jenner’s ex-best friend, Jordyn Woods, at a house party kissing. A clip Jordyn later claims happened when she was drunk. Despite this, Khloe as well as the other Kardashians continued to call her a liar and did not mention Tristan until fans began to call them out for their lop-sided blame. Jordyn later went on Jada Pinkett’s “Red Table Talk” to say her side of the story and that managed to win her a lot of followers. Well, that was March 10.
Only 17 days later, a trailer showing Khloe cry and address the issue as well as Kanye West’s choir only goes on to show that the camera may have been rolling while the scandal was going on because I mean…  Besides, we all know how the business-minded Kris Jenner is concerned about getting stellar ratings and making money. And this has set tongues wagging: Yo the Jordyn-Kylie-Tristan drama happened like last week and y’all made it into a season already? Whew Kris Jenner never sleeps #KUWTK https://t.co/ijhB50IBQE — rie (@_boamenina_) March 27, 2019  But with Jada unfollowing the Kardashians, we doubt that the conspiracy theory is what it is. As the show premieres tomorrow, March 31, trust us to stay glued to our television sets.
