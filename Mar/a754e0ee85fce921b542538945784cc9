On Saturday, March 16, Paris Jackson, the daughter of the late king of pop, Michael Jackson was all over the news with several reports that the youngster had an incident that morning that required medical treatment. A day later, Jackson was spotted stepping out with a smile following a medical scare. She was spotted in the company of her boyfriend, Gabriel Glenn.
