 [FILE PHOTO] A man in handcuffs  EFCC’s acting spokesperson, Tony Orilade in a statement yesterday in Abuja noted that Afolayan was arrested by EFCC operatives on March 5, 2019 following complaints from one of his victims. According to Orilade, trouble started for him when a worker of the Customs Service, Hasaan Garba Muhammed, petitioned the EFCC, accusing him of defrauding innocent Nigerians seeking employment into the service. He had so far defrauded them of about N1 million. Under interrogation, he admitted to the crime. He said: “I started duping people since 2017, I collected different amount of money from my victims and all of them used to transfer money to my bank accounts. I used to tell them that I will help them to secure employment with the Nigerian Custom Services, but I was just scamming them.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
