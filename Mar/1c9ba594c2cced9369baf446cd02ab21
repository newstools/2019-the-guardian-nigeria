 Ahmed Makarfi  Speaking through the Coalition of Southern Kaduna Nationalities (CSKN), they lamented that none of PDP’s bigwigs from Kaduna north, including former Governors Ahmed Makarfi, Mukhtar Ramalan Yero, PDP gubernatorial candidate, Hon. Isa Mohammed Ashiru and Senator Suleiman Hunkuyi could deliver their local governments during the polls. They noted that during the elections, PDP won overwhelmingly in the Southern Zone and lost woefully in the north despite huge expectations that the party’s gladiators from the North will deliver their zone. Addressing a press conference in Kaduna, yesterday, CSKN leader, Dr. Yusuf Gandu Magaji said: “The Southern Kaduna Nationalities are disenchanted with the voting pattern as revealed by the results from Zone 1. We believe there is a betrayal of confidence and trust among the party stalwarts in Zone 1, who can no longer be trusted.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
