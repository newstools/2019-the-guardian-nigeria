Suspected hoodlums on Saturday attacked the vehicle of Desmond Elliot, a Lagos State House of Assembly candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The incident occurred at about 3:00 p.m. at Akerele junction in the Surulere part of the Lagos, where Elliot currently represents in the assembly. Street boys wanted the famous actor to stop and give them money. But the lawmaker decided to keep going. His vehicle was attacked and the windshield broken. Supporters of Elliot at a nearby polling unit, PU20, Ward 7, Surulere, quickly called in reinforcement to rescue the lawmaker. Ad-hoc staffers of the electoral commission, INEC, were advised by security personnel to conclude their vote counting early before the situation escalates. In a quick response, police officers attached to the nearby polling unit called in armed reinforcement that arrived to calm the situation.
