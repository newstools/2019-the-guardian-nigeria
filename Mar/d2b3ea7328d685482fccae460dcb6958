Lagos-based soul singer Maka is back in the forefront with her first single for the year entitled “Precious Stone”. The record is a passionate tribute to all mothers who regardless of the challenges they face still pull through to give their children the life they richly deserve. The song is inspired by Maka’s own mother whose name Ojiugo means Precious Stone in the Igbo language. Over a reflective horn-driven backdrop, Maka delivers a rousing performance that starts off mellow and rises to a crescendo as she reaches deep into her emotions. She talks about her childhood in a single parent home (she lost her dad at a very young age), the ups and downs but most importantly how her mother has continued to support her dream regardless of all the challenges they face. “Precious Stone” was produced by DJ Teck-Zilla of Str8Buttah Productions.
