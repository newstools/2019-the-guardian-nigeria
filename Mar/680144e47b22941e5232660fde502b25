Blood pressure is a measure of the force that your heart uses to pump blood around your body and high blood pressure is a condition in which the force of the blood against the artery walls is too high. Lifestyle plays an important role in treating your high blood pressure. If you successfully control your blood pressure with a healthy lifestyle, you could avoid, delay or reduce the need for medication. Here are a few ways to manage your blood pressure; 1.	Watch Your Weight: Blood pressure often increases as weight increases. Being overweight also can cause disrupted breathing while you sleep (sleep apnea), which further raises your blood pressure so it is imperative that you lose weight and manage yourself properly. 2.	Exercise Regularly: Engaging in physical activity for at least 30 minutes most days of the week can lower your blood pressure by about 5 to 8 mm Hg if you have high blood pressure. It’s important to be consistent because if you stop exercising, your blood pressure can rise again. 3.	Maintain A Healthy Diet: Having a diet that is rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products and skimps on saturated fat and cholesterol can lower your blood pressure by up to 11 mm Hg if you have high blood pressure. 4.	Reduce Sodium Intake: Even a small reduction in the sodium in your diet can improve your heart health and reduce blood pressure by about 5 to 6 mm Hg if you have high blood pressure. That means less processed foods and minimal salt. 5.	Cut Back On Caffeine: Caffeine can raise blood pressure up to 10 mm Hg in people who rarely consume it so it’s best not to consume at all if it’s not necessary.
