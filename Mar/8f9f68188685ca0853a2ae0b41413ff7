J Cole GQ cover Multi-dimensional rapper J Cole recently sat down for a very rare cover shoot and interview session with GQ where he addressed several topics including future collaborations, being shutout by the Grammys, leaving his comfort zone, and more. The rapper had a reputation for putting out solo projects and almost completely avoiding collaborations with other artists but recently he seems to have deviated from that direction as he has already appeared on 21 Savage and Offset’s albums this year.
He says; “I’ve reached the point in my life where I’m like, ‘How long am I gonna be doing this for?’”
“I’m starting to realize like, oh shit — let’s say I stopped this year. I would feel like I missed out on certain experiences ya know? Working with certain artists, being more collaborative, making more friends out of peers, making certain memories that I feel like if I don’t, I’m gonna regret it one day.” Cole spoke about the Dreamville rap camp which resulted in exactly 127 songs which would remain unreleased until they have been organized into a more concise album.
“It was like Disneyland or some shit,” he said of the January Revenge of the Dreamers III sessions. “I’ve been so secluded within myself that people think I don’t like anybody, that I won’t work with anybody. It’s a reputation that’s been extending to my artists, too.” For the rapper, as far as the Grammy Awards go, he is at peace with being overlooked for the rest of his career. “I’m not supposed to have a Grammy, you know what I mean? At least not right now, and maybe never. And if that happens, then that’s just how it was supposed to be,” Cole concludes.
