Mrs. Aremu stressed that she is fully in support of kids taking up sports as a career. “You never can tell where their destiny lies, so it is important to groom them to discover and follow that path,” The games master, Mr. Oyebande Adesina, said organising the students wasn’t difficult, as they expressed willingness and zeal to participate in the sports competition. “This was a healthy and keenly contested event, and I look forward to leading more of this as we have done in the past,” he said.
