The song, which features South African songstress, Rowlene Bosman, presents an edgier Idyl, who maintains his trademark charisma and soulful sound even while propositioning to his love interest and telling her of his intent and ability to satisfy her on all fronts. ‘Satisfy Me’ follows Idyl’s previous critically acclaimed releases, ‘Better Love’ and ‘Owami’, and continues the trend of the soulful singer displaying his impressive vocal range and ability. For her part, Rowlene simply dazzles, with her range and appeal matching Idyl’s intensity, even as both their distinctive sounds complement each other.
