 Wikki Tourists’ goalkeeper, Pius Ibrahim goes for the ball during a recent NPFL game against Enugu Rangers.  The match is one of the five rescheduled games of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL). The Giant Elephants from Bauchi are currently eight on the NPFL group A log with nine points, having played eight matches. However, their hosts, the Sky Blues Stars, are 10th on the table after amassing seven points from nine games. Speaking to The Guardian yesterday, Coach Zubairu said he was confident that Wikki Tourists would triumph over the Remo Stars at the end of the encounter in Shagamu. “Certainly we are going for the three points, and we shall come out victorious. The opposition we are facing does not take anything away from my team. I respect teams, but I am not afraid of any one of them, because I believe we are equal to the task,” he said. The former Akwa United assistant coach, who said the team currently has injury worries, noted the setback would not affect his team’s performance in the crucial game. “There are some players we left behind for this game due to injuries. Unfortunately, our captain is in the list of those injured and also the player with four goals. “Like I said, we have a structure we build our team around. And everyone is expected to ride on it to perform. Though we are going to miss the injured players, their absence would not reduce the team’s quality and focus,” he stated. Meanwhile, other matches rescheduled in the NPFL group A are, a clash between Lobi Stars against Katsina United at the Aper Aku Stadium, while Bendel Insurance will host Enyimba of Aba at the UNIBEN Sport Complex in Benin, Edo State. In the group B, two games will hold, as Gombe United will play hosts to Akwa United at the Pantami Stadium, Gombe, while Kada City FC will welcome Yobe Stars of Damaturu at the Kaduna Township Stadium in a northern derby.
