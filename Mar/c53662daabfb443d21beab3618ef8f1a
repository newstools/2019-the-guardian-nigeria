Mazi Nnamdi Kanu Sureties Never Withdrew— Counsel
Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council (OYC), yesterday, said the re-arrest Order of leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu by Abuja High Court may disrupt the fragile peace in Southern Nigeria, especially Southeast and South/South. In a statement signed by its national president, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro and secretary general, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike in Abakaliki, OYC said it received the news with “shock and disbelief after weighing the implications for the zone.” The body said the ugly experiences that characterised Kanu’s first arrest and subsequent untimely death of innocent Igbo youths and women is still fresh in people’s minds. The statement read in part: “Ohanaeze youths is using this medium to convey our message of peace to IPOB leadership to resist any temptation to allow Nnamdi Kanu to return to Nigeria, as the healing process of those slaughtered during the first arrest and Operation Python Dance have not been completed…” Meanwhile, Special Counsel to Kanu, Mr. Aloy Ejimakor has said none of his (Kanu) sureties had applied to withdraw their suretyship. In a press release, yesterday, Ejimakor said “the reports in the media quoting Justice Binta Murtala-Nyako as stating (when revoking Kanu’s bail on March 28, 2019) that the ‘three sureties who bailed Kanu had applied to the court to withdraw their suretyship’ is inaccurate.” He explained that as the Special counsel, he would have been aware of such development. “I should know because I represent one of the sureties and we never made such application, or anything close to it,” he said.
