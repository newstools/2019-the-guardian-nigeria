 Securities and Exchange Commission  This would ensure that the 125 shareholders’ associations become a force for positive change in public companies, develop the capital market and economy. Acting Director General of SEC, Ms. Mary Uduk, stated this while addressing shareholders at the Issuers and Investors Alternative Dispute Resolution Initiative (IIADRI) yearly symposium in Lagos, at the weekend.  She, however, insisted that mergers were the only means of repositioning shareholders’ associations and improving their value for effective engagement with stakeholders. 
 
She noted that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had 24 recognised investors associations, while 125 shareholders’ associations are presently recognised with more applications being processed for recognition in the country.
 
Uduk spoke on the theme: AGM Optimisation: The Roles of Company Secretaries, Regulators, Registrars, Auditors, Media, Shareholder Associations and other Stakeholders. She said: “The number of shareholders’ associations recognised by SEC is growing and may soon outnumber the listed companies on the Nigerian bourse. “In order to make shareholders’ associations stronger, more influential, effective and indeed enhance shareholders value, it is advised that some of the associations should form stronger alliances through mergers.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
