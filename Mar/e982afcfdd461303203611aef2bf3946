Super Eagles Coach, Gernot Rohr. Super Eagles Coach, Gernot Rohr will name the players that would play in the African Nations Cup qualifier against Seychelles and the international friendly against Egypt this week. The coach, who said he would pick the best players for the matches billed for Asaba, Delta State on March 22 and 26 respectively, described the matches as important games that Nigeria must win to build their confidence going into June’s Nations Cup in Egypt. Super Eagles Media Officer, Toyin Ibitoye told The Guardian at the weekend, “Rohr will release the list of foreign and domestic players for the AFCON qualifier against Seychelles and the friendly against Egypt this week. The two games are in the same week and the coach will be inviting mostly regular players for the game against Seychelles. “It is the same set of players that will also battle Egypt. Based on the fact that Nigeria has already booked the ticket for the 2019 AFCON, the coach will use the games to prepare for the African championship and also test some new players.” Ibitoye revealed that Rohr, who just left the country on a short trip to Europe, would soon return to start preparing for the games.
