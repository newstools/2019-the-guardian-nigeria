While people around the world who are interested in beauty may be familiar with the recent trend of plastic surgery, a group of researchers from the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston have concluded that the worst place to carry out plastic surgery is Caribbean country, Dominican Republic. The researchers who conducted a study over a 14-year-period found that a lot of post-surgery infections were mostly gotten from those who had travelled to the country for surgery. What this implies is that out of the 42 patients that had gotten fatal infections between 2003 and 2017, 20 of them had gone to the Dominican Republic for tummy tucks, breast reductions and liposuction, the research published in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery stated. Most of the issues listed are poor hygiene from doctors, surgeries by quack doctors and surgeries carried out in clinics that are not properly regulated. The report also looked at the cases in various journal databases to arrive at their findings. Some of the other countries listed are Mexico, Thailand, China, Ecuador, Panama and Venezuela. According to their study, the most common infections are Mycobacterium abscessus and Mycobacterium fortuitum – antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria found in water, soil and dirt. Meanwhile, in the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned people to desist from travelling to the country for surgery in the name of “medical tourism.” In 2001 when Modupe Ozolua introduced her plastic surgery company Body Enhancement in Nigeria, it was received with disdain by the middle and lower class of the society. However in 2018, after Nigerian actress, Tonto Dike, happy with her enhancement, posted pictures of her new body, it has become a go-to for many who hope to have a youthful appearance.
