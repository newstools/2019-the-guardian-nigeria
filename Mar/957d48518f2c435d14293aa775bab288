 Kidney<br />PHOTO: google.com/search  The group opines that taking care of the kidney is key in preventing individuals from having kidney failure, as many Nigerians can’t afford dialysis sessions. Speaking at a healthcare outreach organised by GAHKI recently in Ojuelegba Community in Lagos, the group’s executive secretary, Sam Nabena, urge the federal and state governments to subsidize the cost of treatment. “We are glad that Surulere Local Government Health Centre partnered with us and we hope that there would be more of this in other areas to reach out to more people as we are currently treating 12 patients at a subsidised rate. Executive director, JKF Dialysis Centre, Adefolawe Sutton, however stated that about 80 per cent of Nigerians cannot really afford the cost of dialysis sessions, she noted that with the help of donors, a complete three dialysis session per week is achieved to improve the life of patients. While a member, Board of Trustees, GAHKI, Kunbi Ojomo, said the event which is in line with the World’s Kidney Day will further drive awareness and help those already suffering from the disease. “The cost of a dialysis session is about N35,000 to N50,000 depending on where you go, we are helping them pay part of the money so that they can have a healthy lifestyle. We are affiliated with a dialysis clinic and its the cheapest in the community.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
