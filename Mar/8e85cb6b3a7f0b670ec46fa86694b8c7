 National Commissioner INEC,  Festus Okoye  Mr Festus Okoye, INEC National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee, said this in Abuja. Okoye said the clarification was important going by allegations since the conduct of the February 23, Presidential and National Assembly elections that INEC was selective in the use of smart card readers in the conduct of the exercise. He said the allegations had led to speculations that INEC may be forced to jettison the use of SCRs in the state and FCT  area council polls. “INEC hereby states categorically that the allegations are absolutely false and the speculations are without any basis whatsoever. “The use of the smart card readers is not only mandatory but its deliberate non use attracts the sanction of possible prosecution of erring officials in accordance with the INEC Regulations and Guidelines for the conduct of elections. “This is in addition to the voiding of any result emanating from such units or areas, as was done in the presidential and national assembly elections of February 23. “The general public and all officials engaged for the elections are hereby informed that the commission is not reconsidering the use of these smart card readers which has greatly improved the credibility of our elections and instilled a high level of public trust in them. “To clear any doubt or ambiguity, we wish to state that the deployment and mandatory use of SCRs in next Saturday’s elections will not only be uniformed but also universal, and the provisions of the regulations and guidelines will be strictly and vigorously enforced. “All stakeholders are to note and be guided accordingly please,” Okoye said.
