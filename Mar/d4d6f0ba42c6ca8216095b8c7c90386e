A keto or ketogenic diet is a low-carb diet, which can help you burn fat a quick rate. Many people have already experienced its proven benefits for weight loss, health and performance. Although at this point experts are not entirely sure why it works so fast in some cases. Essentially, the keto diet is any extremely low- or no-carbohydrate diet that forces the body into a state of ketosis. <img class="size-full wp-image-881354 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ketogenic-Diet-Photo.-Alilat.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="750" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ketogenic-Diet-Photo.-Alilat.jpg 1200w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ketogenic-Diet-Photo.-Alilat-957x598.jpg 957w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ketogenic-Diet-Photo.-Alilat-487x304.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ketogenic-Diet-Photo.-Alilat-974x609.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ketogenic-Diet-Photo.-Alilat-320x200.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ketogenic-Diet-Photo.-Alilat-640x400.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ketogenic-Diet-Photo.-Alilat-600x375.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /> Ketosis occurs when people eat a low- or no-carb diet and molecules called ketones to build up in their bloodstream. Low carbohydrate levels cause blood sugar levels to drop and the body breaks down fat to use as energy.
Ketosis is a mild form of ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis affects people with type 1 diabetes. In fact, it is the leading cause of death of people with diabetes who are under 24 years of age. Dr Gianfranco Cappello, an associate professor of surgery at the Sapienza University in Rome, Italy created the keto diet.
He claims great success among thousands of users. In his study, over 19,000 dieters experienced significant, rapid weight loss, few side effects, and most kept the weight off after a year. According to the reported results, patients lost an average of 10.2 kilograms, or about 22 pounds, after 2.5 cycles of the keto diet. Cappello concluded that the diet was a successful way for overweight and obese people to lose weight, and they easily manage the few side effects, such as fatigue. Some healthcare professionals still insist that keto-type diets work only in the short term and can be unhealthy. Most of the lost weight is water weight, according to Lisa Cimperman, R.D.N., a clinical dietitian at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio, and a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. “Once your body enters ketosis, you also begin to lose muscle, become extremely fatigued, and eventually enter starvation mode. Then it becomes even harder to lose weight.” “Keto diets should only be used under clinical supervision and only for brief periods,” Francine Blinten, R.D., a certified clinical nutritionist and public health consultant in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, told Healthline. “They have worked successfully on some cancer patients in conjunction with chemotherapy to shrink tumours and to reduce seizures among people suffering from epilepsy.” <img class="size-full wp-image-881355 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/range-of-foods-from-Keto-Diet-Photo.-Medical-News-Today.jpg" alt="" width="1100" height="728" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/range-of-foods-from-Keto-Diet-Photo.-Medical-News-Today.jpg 1100w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/range-of-foods-from-Keto-Diet-Photo.-Medical-News-Today-904x598.jpg 904w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/range-of-foods-from-Keto-Diet-Photo.-Medical-News-Today-487x322.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/range-of-foods-from-Keto-Diet-Photo.-Medical-News-Today-974x645.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/range-of-foods-from-Keto-Diet-Photo.-Medical-News-Today-320x212.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/range-of-foods-from-Keto-Diet-Photo.-Medical-News-Today-640x424.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/range-of-foods-from-Keto-Diet-Photo.-Medical-News-Today-600x397.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px" /> In the general population, Blinten said a keto diet should only be considered in extreme cases. She further stated “It can do more harm than good. It can damage the heart, which is also a muscle.” Blinten, who has used a keto diet for some cancer patients in specific circumstances, cautioned, “people will do anything to get the weight off.” However, a keto diet will do more harm than good for the majority of patients, especially if they have any underlying kidney or liver issues.
She concluded by saying “People are using this for cosmetic reasons, but it’s so extreme that it’s dangerous,”.
