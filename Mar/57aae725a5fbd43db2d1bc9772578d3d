Veteran music star, Tony Tetuila shut down rumours that he collected payment for the song he made for Lagos state governor-elect, Babajide Sanwo-Olu. According to the Nigerian singer, he didn’t collect any payment from the politician as he made the song as part of his contribution to Sanwo-olu’s campaign during the just concluded 2019 gubernatorial elections in Lagos State. Explaining that he made the song because he himself is a politician, Tetuila said, “I am a member of the APC; so, I did the song as my contribution to the campaign of the incoming governor of Lagos State, Sanwo-Olu. People shouldn’t forget that I am a politician too; I contested the state House of Assembly election in Kwara State in 2015.”
