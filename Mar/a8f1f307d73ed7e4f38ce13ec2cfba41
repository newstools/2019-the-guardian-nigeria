Cardi B’s career took off the minute she released her smash hit song, “Bodak Yellow” that became the first rap song by a female rapper to peak at number one since Lauryn Hill’s “Doo Wop (That Thing)” in November 1998 (19 years gap). From topping music charts to breaking records as well as clinching major awards, Cardi B has been soaring and she is about to add yet another feather to her cap. According to several reports, the mother of one is to star in her debut feature film with a film titled “Hustlers”. Cardi B won’t be having the spotlight alone as stars like Jennifer Lopez, Keke Palmer, Julia Stiles, Constance Wu, Lili Reinhart and more would also be featured in the film. It is gathered that Hustlers is inspired by a 2016 New York Magazine article and the film follows a crew of savvy former strip club employees who band together to turn the tables on their Wall Street clients.
