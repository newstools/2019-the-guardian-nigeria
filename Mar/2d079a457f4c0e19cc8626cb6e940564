Early reactions for Jordan Peele’s Get Out follow-up Us are finally surfacing. These reactions prove that Peele is by no means a one-hit wonder in the horror genre. Us tells the story of a family of four who take a trip to their beach house over the summer, hoping to unwind. However, their relaxation is cut short when another family – their own doppelgängers – show up one night and begin wreaking havoc. Though it’s unclear why exactly they’re there, let alone where they come from, wife and husband Adelaide and Gabe (Lupita Nyong’o and Winston Duke, respectively) must do whatever is necessary to keep their family safe. Now, after fans have been anticipating this since 2017, the early reviews are finally here to determine whether or not it was worth the wait. After screening at SXSW in Austin, Texas, critics have been posting brief reactions for Us online; not to worry, there are no spoilers. To find out exactly what the critics are saying, enjoy these SPOILER-FREE early reactions: Ok, so #UsMovie is fucking terrifying. #SXSW19 — David Fear (@davidlfear) March 9, 2019  #UsMovie is a heck of an experience. Funny enough to make you laugh, scary enough to make you scream, genuinely heartbreaking in moments, anchored by several incredible dual performances, especially Lupita’s. #SXSW — Angie J. Han (@ajhan) March 9, 2019  Jordan Peele’s #Us is absolutely nuts! Deliriously horrific, incredibly inventive, it has elements of the home invasion & zombie movies, but it is unlike anything I have ever seen. Wildly captivating from start to finish. #SXSW pic.twitter.com/vATBSUhD7e — Erik Davis (@ErikDavis) March 9, 2019
