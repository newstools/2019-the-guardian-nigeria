There is a risk he’ll miss the first leg against Ajax,” Allegri said. “We have to be careful because we’re in a tricky period of the season. It’s better he misses one match and comes back when he’s 100 per cent so there’s no risk of a repeat injury. It’s better to miss one match than two months,” Allegri added. Serie A champions Juventus travel to Amsterdam before hosting the Dutch outfit on April 16 with the Italians looking for a first European title since 1996. Juve have virtually wrapped up the Scudetto crown for an eighth straight season as they hold a 15-point lead over second place Napoli with 10 games of the season to go and face lowly Empoli on Saturday.
