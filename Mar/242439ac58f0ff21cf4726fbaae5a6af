Barely eight days to the governorship elections, the Abia State Accord Party guber candidate, Emeka Uwakolam took his supporters and party members to the state campaign Office of his APGA counterpart, Alex Otti and announced his withdrawal from the contest, declaring support for Otti. He said that though he had and still has passion to serve the state, he was withdrawing from the contest to partner with Otti whom he described as the candidate with higher capacity; saying their joint endeavor would rescue the state from the Ikpeazu led PDP government to enthrone good governance, adding that his decision was not induced as they both share the same ideology. Describing the development as epoch making, Otti said that Uwakolam is one of the strongest guber candidates in the state who share and sell the same ideology and decry god-fatherism. He explained that their partnership is for the guber contest hence Uwakolam has not decamped from the Accord Party. Meanwhile, state APGA Chairman, Augustine Ehiemere expressed fears that “if certain decisive measures are not taken by INEC in Abia to correct obvious abnormalities in the INEC list of officials before the conduct of the guber election, INEC might be preparing the ground for chaos and violence”. He urged INEC to remove all compromised officials saying “ we have it on good authority that some INEC staff that have spent a long time in Abia are on the payroll of the PDP and shall be used to achieve the bidding of the party”.
