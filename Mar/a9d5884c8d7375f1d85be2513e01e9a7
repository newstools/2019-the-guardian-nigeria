Kano-based Islamic scholar and Chairman, Kano state Council of Prerogative of Mercy, Sheikh Ahmad Sulaiman, has been released from captivity. The famous Quranic reciter and member of Jama’atu Izalatil Bid’ah Wa’ikamatis Sunnah, a Northern-based Islamic propagation movement, was kidnapped by unknown gunmen in Katsina and demanded N300million before his release. Sheikh Ahmad was abducted along five other members of the group on their way to Sokoto State after attending a First Aid Camp in Dutse, Jigawa State. Ahmad was said to have been kidnapped a day before the wedding ceremony of his two daughters in Kano. It is not clear if the ransom was paid or not. A member of the family, Mallam Hamisu Nasidi, told The Guardian that Sheikh Ahmad was released at about 12 midnight Tuesday in Katsina and is presently at the Katsina state police headquarters. “He was released last night around 12 midnight and he is hale and hearty. We give thanks to Almighty Allah. He is presently at the headquarters of police in Katsina. We are expecting him back to Kano later in the day. We thank you for your support”. Hamisu said.
