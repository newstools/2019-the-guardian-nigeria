Omari Hardwick who plays Ghost on popular HBO series Power has become the recipient of online trolling thanks to an awkward embrace with Beyoncé at the NAACP Awards which held on Saturday. While greeting her, the actor went in for two kisses including one near the mouth. Afterwards, Beyoncé was seen looking slightly uncomfortable.
Beyoncé’s fans were swift to take action and drag Hardwick for his presumed invasion of her personal space. Damn, Ghost – that’s how you feel?

Women don’t need to be grabbed, hugged and kissed unless its your wife/girlfriend. Beyonce should have slapped him !pic.twitter.com/MqflX03BYU — Whorfery (@Whorfery) March 31, 2019  Regardless of the “unexpected kiss”, The night went well for Queen Bey as she was honoured as the “Entertainer of the Year”, beating Chadwick Boseman, Ryan Coogler, Regina King, and LeBron James. JAY-Z was equally honoured as he received the President’s Award.
