 Nigeria Football Federation Office  Former international, Harrison Jalla, had complained to the Investigatory Chamber of the Ethics Committee of FIFA on December 5, 2018, alleging reckless spending by some top officials of the NFF. After waiting for response for one month, Jalla wrote another letter to FIFA on January 26, 2019, requesting for information on the ‘current status’ of his complaint. However, the Investigatory Chamber of the Ethics Committee of FIFA said in its response made available to The Guardian: “We acknowledge receipt of and have taken note of your correspondence. “In this regard, we express our appreciation for the information provided and would like to point out that in accordance with art. 58 par. 1 of the FIFA Code of Ethics (FCE), any person may file a complaint regarding potential breaches of the FCE with the Secretariat of the Investigatory Chamber. “Moreover, and for the sake of clarity please note that the Chairperson of the Investigatory Chamber may initiate preliminary investigations at his own discretion and at any time (cf. art. 59 of the FCE). “Notwithstanding the above, even though a person is entitled to report conducts considered incompatible with the FCE, this does not mean that such person will be considered as a party in the framework of any potential ethics proceedings, as only the accused are considered as such parties (see art. 37 of the FCE). “As a consequence of the foregoing, we would like to reiterate that we are not in a position to provide you further information regarding your above-mentioned inquiries and/or the state of the proceedings before the FIFA Ethics Committee (if any). However, in the event that we would need any further information or documents from your part, you will be contacted in due course.”
