The incident, according to a statement by the command’s spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, occurred at Ajuwon Estate. He said: “The suspect admitted to the police that he came to his house at about 12:30 midnight on March 17 and met the deceased inside the house with his wife. This infuriated him and he started beating the man and hit his head against the wall leading to the victim’s death. “But on her own part, the suspect’s wife, who is at the centre of the crisis, Titilayo Olayiwola, denied having any romantic relationship with the deceased. She explained that the suspect has abandoned her in the house for the past eight months with an instruction to the gateman to be monitoring her and give him information if he sees her with any man.” Oyeyemi said the suspect’s wife further disclosed that “the victim was a cobbler living within the area and on that day, the deceased’s girlfriend came to pay him visit and since he is not living alone, he decided to bring the girl to a room in the house due to his closeness to the family. But as soon as the gateman saw him, he alerted the husband who rushed to the house and descended heavily on the deceased without listening to any explanation from her and the victim’s girlfriend.” The body of the deceased has been deposited at the general hospital mortuary for post-mortem examination. The Commissioner of Police, Ahmed Iliyasu, has ordered the immediate transfer of the case to the homicide section of the state criminal investigation and intelligence department for prosecution of the case.
