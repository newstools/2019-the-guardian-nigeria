MMG boss Rick Ross has come to Cardi B’s defense following her admission that she used to drug and rob men which has gotten serious backlash. On Thursday, Ross took to Snapchat and shared his thoughts about the situation. “Leave Cardi B alone and the reason I tell you that is in a lot of circumstances, that’s what come with that lifestyle. She never hid that,” he said. The Miami rapper ended his remarks by saying he thinks it’s pointless to condemn a person for past indiscretions if they change their behavior. “If you stole a car in the past, that don’t mean you shouldn’t get money in the future. As long as you change your ways and we all know Cardi B focused on the money now and she is a leader,” he said. Cardi’s problems began when a 3-year-old video where she claims to have drugged and robbed men before becoming famous resurfaced and the revelation has gathered a lot of traction and even inspired the hashtag #SurvivingCardiB, a reference to the explosive docuseries about R. Kelly’s alleged sexual abuse with people tagging Cardi B a sexual offender and calling for her victims to come forward so she cann be prosecuted.
