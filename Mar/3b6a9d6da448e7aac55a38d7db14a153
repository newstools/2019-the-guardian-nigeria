 Former Benue State Governor, Gabriel Suswam  Suswam, in a chat with journalists, yesterday, condemned Akume’s action of mobilising and leading thugs in the name of celebrating President Buhari’s victory to destroy Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) campaign billboards and residents’ property. He described the act as capable of overheating the polity, as well as creating an uncontrollable spate of violence in the state, which has experienced series of attacks and killings by Fulani militia in recent times. He urged Akume to be a good example to the younger generation and advised other winners of last week’s elections to be magnanimous in victory. He appealed to losers not to be lawless, but seek redress in court if aggrieved. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
