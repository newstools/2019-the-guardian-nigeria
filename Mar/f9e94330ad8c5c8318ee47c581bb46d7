Legendary Nigerian singer, 2face Idibia was recently a guest at the palace of the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, in Ile Ife, Osun State, Nigeria. The multiple award-winning singer went over to the monarch’s palace following his visit to Obafemi Awolowo University in Ife where he lectured the music department. During his visit to the Ooni of Ife, 2face performed a song to the delight of the Oba who took to social media with a video of the singer’s presence in his palace. Watch the video below:   A great pleasure receiving TuFace, the peace ambassador to the throne of Oduduwa and his adorable wifey, Annie Idibia.  I thank God for your giant strides in life so far, especially the fellowship award given to Tuface by the department of Music from the prestigious Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU); Congratulations!!! _ You are now also TuBobo; Annie, please don't get angry about the new name I just gave your husband, it is because he looks much younger every passing day… I bid you greater successes in life.  #OoniofIfe #Otisese A post shared by  Ooni Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi (@ooniadimulaife) on Mar 20, 2019 at 2:23pm PDT  We reported earlier that 2Face’s former bandmate, Blackface called him out for the alleged stealing of songs and shows. In a diss track titled “War” by Blackface, he alleged that 2Face is gay but later clarified that because he said it doesn’t mean it is true.
