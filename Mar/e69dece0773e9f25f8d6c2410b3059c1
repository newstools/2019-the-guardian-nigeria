 University of Ibadan  Speaking at a briefing yesterday, Adeyemo lauded Africa 2050 for its impactful work across universities in Africa. “I can tell you categorically that University of Ibadan is happy to host Africa 2050 to an upcoming summit in June 15, at the Senate Chamber of the university.” She stressed the importance of reaching out to the younger generation who are the leaders of tomorrow. “It appears African youths are engrossed with entertainment while they think less of politics, having the wrong perception that politics is a dirty game, but Africa 2050 Summit across Africa has rekindled my hope in correcting this anomaly and encouraging youths to wake up and actively get involved in politics,’’ she said. Earlier, Olaide Ogunsanya, the Public Relations Officer of Africa 2050, said the initiative is a shared passion by the Circle Media Plus and African Voice Newspaper UK, which is becoming a movement of passionate youths to see a developed continent before 2050. “We have organised Africa 2050 Summit in University of Kenya Nairobi, Kampala University Uganda, Lead City University Ibadan, and University of Ghana Accra. We are looking forward to a great summit at the University of Ibadan with the theme, ‘Who will fix Nigeria?’ The summit promises to be a great one having selected Prof. Remi Aiyede of the Political Science Department,  Dr. Muyiwa Adigun of the Faculty of Law and Dr. Segun Akinlolu (Beautiful Nubia)  to speak at the summit. Also we are  using this opportunity to call on sponsors and partners across Africa to support this initiative’’ she said.
