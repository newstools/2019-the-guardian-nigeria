The Lagos Central Senatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Adesunbo Onitiri, has called on the state government to immediately commence building low cost houses, to accommodate low-income families at affordable prices. Onitiri, who commiserated with parents and families of children and residents who lost their lives, described the incident as highly regrettable and a big disaster to the entire people of Lagos State. “The upsurge in the idea of government erecting housing schemes for the rich must stop. The role of government is to provide accommodation for our low-income earners, as its welfare scheme. Government has no role in profiteering on housing scheme or building houses for the rich. The rich can provide homes for themselves,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
