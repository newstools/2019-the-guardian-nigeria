One of the alleged persons, Brett Barnes, molested by Michael Jackson has called on HBO to stop alleging that he was molested by the star. He is taking it a step further by suing HBO for insinuating that he was molested, TMZ claims. In the documentary, “Leaving Neverland” Barnes is shown as a boy who was molested by the star after Wade Robson says in the documentary that Barnes “replaced him” when Jackson was done with him. After this, the documentary shows Jackson with Barnes. But Barnes claims that the documentary subjected him to “hatred, contempt and ridicule.” His lawyer also says that HBO did not gain consent before using his images or anything related to him, Barnes, in 2005, in a law court testified alongside Macaulay Culkin that he was not molested by Jackson.
