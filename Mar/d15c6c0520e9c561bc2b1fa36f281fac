It is almost impossible to do your makeup, head out and return looking perfect this season. Melting makeup, smeared eyeliner, and super-sticky lipstick are definite no’s for makeup. Here are a few tips for keeping your makeup looking fresh and pretty, even when the weather is working against you. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-891540 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Lancome-La-Base-Pro-Perfecting-Makeup-Primer.-Photo-Dillars.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1484" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Lancome-La-Base-Pro-Perfecting-Makeup-Primer.-Photo-Dillars.jpg 880w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Lancome-La-Base-Pro-Perfecting-Makeup-Primer.-Photo-Dillars-516x598.jpg 516w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Lancome-La-Base-Pro-Perfecting-Makeup-Primer.-Photo-Dillars-481x557.jpg 481w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Lancome-La-Base-Pro-Perfecting-Makeup-Primer.-Photo-Dillars-207x240.jpg 207w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Lancome-La-Base-Pro-Perfecting-Makeup-Primer.-Photo-Dillars-414x480.jpg 414w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Lancome-La-Base-Pro-Perfecting-Makeup-Primer.-Photo-Dillars-518x600.jpg 518w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Your skin care is just as important as the makeup you use on it. For this season, using an oil-free moisturiser in the mornings. Also, using an oil-free foundation formula is important in extremely hot weather situations. This is the time to invest in primers, they do not feel heavy or look like an added weight on the makeup. Yet, they are especially good for holding makeup in place. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-891545 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Oil-free-foundations-for-the-hot-weather.-Photo-Ranks.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Oil-free-foundations-for-the-hot-weather.-Photo-Ranks.jpg 800w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Oil-free-foundations-for-the-hot-weather.-Photo-Ranks-797x598.jpg 797w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Oil-free-foundations-for-the-hot-weather.-Photo-Ranks-320x240.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Oil-free-foundations-for-the-hot-weather.-Photo-Ranks-640x480.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Oil-free-foundations-for-the-hot-weather.-Photo-Ranks-487x365.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Oil-free-foundations-for-the-hot-weather.-Photo-Ranks-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Less is definitely more if you want to keep your makeup from creasing and caking. Makeup moves around when it’s hot, so the best way to avoid that is to wear less of it. While everyone loves a nice, dewy glow, there is a big difference between a healthy radiance and an over-the-top shine. For now, avoid cream foundations or anything too bright, as the humidity will make you extra shiny and sweaty-looking if you have too much sparkle on your skin. Moroccan Spice Eyeshadow Palette Choose subtle sheer or nude colours this season as rich deep colours often tend to look overboard. Also, avoid using eye cream on your lids (it can break down the makeup), and smooth on an eye primer instead. This will minimise creasing and create a base for the shadow to cling to so it lasts longer. Layering powder and cream are another simple yet efficient way. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-891542 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Makeup.-Photo-amymiranda.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Makeup.-Photo-amymiranda.jpg 900w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Makeup.-Photo-amymiranda-897x598.jpg 897w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Makeup.-Photo-amymiranda-487x325.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Makeup.-Photo-amymiranda-320x213.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Makeup.-Photo-amymiranda-640x427.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Makeup.-Photo-amymiranda-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> While blush adds a healthy and balanced look to any makeup, using a powder blush this season makes your overall look appear misplaced so it’s time to dump that powder blush. Rather try a gel or blush stain for long-lasting wear. Bronzer makes your eyes look brighter, your teeth whiter, everyone looks better with a little warmth added to their skin. To keep the results looking fresh and natural, apply the bronzer just to the high points of your face, where the sun naturally hits you: forehead, cheekbones, chin, and nose. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-431406 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/My-Little-Pony-x-Colourpop-Ultra-Glossy-Lip-in-Flutter-Valley.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1920" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/My-Little-Pony-x-Colourpop-Ultra-Glossy-Lip-in-Flutter-Valley.jpg 480w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/My-Little-Pony-x-Colourpop-Ultra-Glossy-Lip-in-Flutter-Valley-399x598.jpg 399w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/My-Little-Pony-x-Colourpop-Ultra-Glossy-Lip-in-Flutter-Valley-371x557.jpg 371w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/My-Little-Pony-x-Colourpop-Ultra-Glossy-Lip-in-Flutter-Valley-160x240.jpg 160w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/My-Little-Pony-x-Colourpop-Ultra-Glossy-Lip-in-Flutter-Valley-320x480.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/My-Little-Pony-x-Colourpop-Ultra-Glossy-Lip-in-Flutter-Valley-400x600.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Toss your heavy matte lipsticks and try more simple trends. Stains are lovely because you can always add a lip balm to add moisture without worrying about the colour travelling. This is the time to bring out your cherry lip glosses and drop the matte lipsticks for more nude colours. This is the time to invest in good waterproof makeup items: mascara, eyeliners, matte foundations. Develop the habit of keeping prep items in your purse. Never look oily in a photo again by staying prepared with purse-size products that are also perfect for travel. Having blotting papers is a great way to whisk away the sweat and oil without piling on more product. So girl, keep your makeup fresh with these tips and keep shining even in this heat.
