He has returned only twice since then, staying less than 48 hours each time, although the government has insisted that he is in good shape. In late February, Bongo led a cabinet meeting during which a raft of appointments were announced and several close aides were dismissed, although no media were on hand for the event. His prolonged absence has stoked concern about a vacuum of power, apparently sparking a brief attempted coup by renegade soldiers on January 7. It has also sparked rumours that he has a body double for public appearances — a scenario that the president’s office vigorously dismissed on March 7. Bongo took office after an election in 2009 that followed the death of his father, former president Omar Bongo, who took office in 1967.
