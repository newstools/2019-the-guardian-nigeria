The 34-year-old replaces Englishman Rose by the narrowest of margins — 0.0008 average points — in top spot, a position he has held for 81 weeks in his career. Neither player was active this past week as both skipped the Honda Classic in Florida, allowing Johnson to return to number one for the first time since the Tour Championship in September. Brooks Koepka traded places with Justin Thomas as the former moved up to third, while Rickie Fowler jumped to seventh as he climbed above Xander Schauffele and Jon Rahm. World top 20 1.
