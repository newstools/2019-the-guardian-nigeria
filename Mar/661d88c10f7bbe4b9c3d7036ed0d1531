We are doing well, we are having a good season and we are in a good place now in the sense of the football that we are playing,” said Begiristain. “So, we are confident, but we know Tottenham will create problems… We played last season (in the quarter-finals) against Liverpool and did not go through. I hope this time we have better luck.” With the Champions League now down to the last eight, Begiristain said every team remaining in the tournament were formidable challengers. “We are here (in the tournament). Everybody deserves to be a candidate in this competition,” he said. “Ajax, they eliminate Real Madrid, Porto (the same) with Roma, everyone is a candidate. So, we have to be very focused. There is no time for mistakes as in the Champions League one mistake and you are out. “So, we will be focused but the fact that we are playing well and in a good rhythm will help.” City, chasing an unprecedented quadruple, beat Tottenham 1-0 at Wembley in October in the Premier League in their only meeting so far this season.
