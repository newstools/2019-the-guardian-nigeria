The election authorities said it suspended the presentation after an Appeal Court judgment, which nullified the participation of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the 2019 elections in Zamfara State. A Sokoto State Court of Appeal led by Justice Tom Yakubu, on Monday set aside the judgment of a Zamfara High Court on the APC primaries that produced the party’s candidates for the governorship, National and State Assembly elections. Just few days to the governorship and State House of Assembly poll, a Zamfara High Court recognised the primary election that produced governorship, state and national assembly candidates held by APC in the state and declared that INEC should accept the party candidates for the elections. Unsatisfied with State High Court decision, the appellants, approached the appeal court challenging the decision on the ground that the State High Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the suit among others. Based on the initial court ruling, INEC allowed the APC to field governorship and parliamentary candidates. The APC went on to win the governorship and parliamentary elections in Zamfara. However, unless Monday’s appeal court ruling is upturned by the Supreme Court, the APC may lose the positions.
