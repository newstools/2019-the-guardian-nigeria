He,however, expressed satisfaction with the way and manner the election was conducted throughout the 34 local government areas of the state. The minister stressed the need for the electorate to always come out en mass and vote for candidates of their choice, saying there was no way of achieving good governance except through democratic process. “The essence of governance is security of life and property and then improvement of living conditions of our people and you can see that is only achievable by way of democracy and through elections. These elections are done in a peaceful and conducive environment. “So, I think the people understood this – that was why they came out two weeks ago en mass, to vote our president, Muhammadu Buhari and his party, the APC. “And today also they have come out to vote the candidates of their choice. So I do believe that they understand this and I also call upon them to participate in the process because participation in the process is the guarantee to good governance. “If you don’t participate you have no reason to complain; if you don’t participate you don’t understand the rigours in it and you don’t appreciate the success and you don’t appreciate the failure,’’ he said. On the reported cases of electoral violence across the country, Sirika advocated for stiffer punishment for electoral offenders, to serve as deterrence to others. The minister also expressed the hope that the re-election of President Buhari for a new four-year tenure would be a blessing to Nigerians. According to him, the president is determined to transform and move the country to the Next Level of socio-economic prosperity, peace and stability.
