Apple is giving Netflix a run for its money! The Tech giant’s star-studded event which held in Cupertino, California, on Monday morning, witnessed an unveiling of a host of new subscription services. Last week, Apple announced new products with little fanfare, saving its firepower for Monday’s celebration of services, which included the most interesting part – unveiling the Apple TV+. Steven Spielberg, Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston, Steve Carrell, Kumail Nanjiani, and Big Bird were on hand to promote new creative projects that will be released through Apple’s new subscription television service, Apple TV+.  Spielberg’s Amazing Stories will resurrect the 93-year-old brand of a science fiction magazine that inspired the director as a child. Witherspoon and Aniston announced The Morning Show, described by Aniston as “an honest look at the complex relationship between women and men in the workplace”. The event also showcased a new children’s series, a performance by Sara Bareilles, who is producing a show with JJ Abrams, and another sci-fi series starring Jason Momoa and Alfre Woodard. Apple is now looking to reorient its revenue streams to rely less on expensive hardware sales and more on subscription services.
