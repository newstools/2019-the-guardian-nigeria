 Stella Oduah  In a statement yesterday in Abuja, she said: “In the coming days, I would be setting up a think-tank to look into the areas of drug dependency, abuse currently ravaging our land; and I must say that this is the issue that is very dear to my heart.“My dear people, my brothers and my sisters, your endorsement will spur me to do more, and I call on all well-meaning members of this Anambra Senatorial District to please join hands with me as we set out to give Anambra North another wonderful four years of purposeful representation. “It is also pertinent to note that despite my strive in infrastructural development that has ensured that we have a well-constructed and rehabilitated countless roads, schools, police stations, boreholes, street lights and so on, the one thing that really gets me excited is ameliorating the plight of the downtrodden in our midst. “It is in this regard that I spent four years pursuing a vigorous programme that has seen an immeasurable number of widows being engaged in training and different programmes. “Also in this regard, the youths have equally benefitted from countless economic development scheme designed to make them self-reliant.”and that is towards building community liaison officers that are and will be always on alert to draw my attention to anomalies when they begin.” She, therefore, called on those who lost to her at the just-concluded election to join hands with her to improve the living standard of people in the senatorial district through quality representation, adding that her re-election for second tenure was proof of God’s love for her and her people.
