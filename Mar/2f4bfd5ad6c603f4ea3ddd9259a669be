Reality TV star and mom of one, Kylie Jenner has insisted that she is still with her baby daddy, Travis Scott amidst rumours that he cheated with her. According to sources who spoke with celebrity gossip site, TMZ, Kylie doesn’t plan on making any drastic decision to blow up her family as she is willing to try and work things out with Scott. There had been earlier reports that the couple got into a massive fight Wednesday after Travis flew home to surprise his baby mama and Stormi. We’re told at some point during the visit, Kylie went through Travis’ phone and discovered “evidence” he had been unfaithful. Scott has since denied the allegations of his supposed infidelity. It would be recalled that this cheating scandal is coming on the heels of Kylie’s best friend, Jordyn Woods hooking up with Tristan Thompson who is Khloe Kardashian’s (Kylie’s sister) baby daddy.
