 Ogun APC candidate Dapo Abiodun  The petition, filed yesterday by the party’s Secretary, Sunday Oginni, asked the tribunal to nullify the result of the election and also prayed it to order the withdrawal of the Certificate of Return issued to Abiodun. The INEC had declared Abiodun the winner of the governorship election having polled the highest number of votes. The LP also prayed that the tribunal should order the INEC to conduct a fresh election within 21 days of its decision and include its logo and symbol. The party claimed that INEC’s action had deprived its governorship candidate, Modupe Sanyaolu, an opportunity to participate in the election and win. The petition read in part: “That the second petitioner was confident of winning the governorship election held on March 9, 2019 being the only female governorship candidate among all the candidates that stood for the governorship election and also contesting on the platform of the first petitioner, being the party of the masses and the labour force for civil servants, artisans and families in Ogun State.” Meanwhile, in the ex-parte motion filed by Oginni and others, they prayed the tribunal to order INEC to produce and grant it access to all documents used for the governorship election in the state for inspection. They also asked the tribunal to order INEC to allow it inspect all documents used in the governorship election of the state held on March 9, 2019, particularly the governorship ballot papers.
