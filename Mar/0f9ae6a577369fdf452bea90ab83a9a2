The Independent National Electoral Commission has suspended the collation of gubernatorial rerun results indefinitely after receiving results of 26 local government areas. The state returning officer Professor Bello B. Shehu told journalists that the results of Gama ward in Nassarawa and Kibiya LGs were still being awaited. But a source said four collation officers have absconded with results sheets for the controversial but coveted Gama ward. The Guardian learnt from a reliable source in INEC that collation of four polling units in Gama where returning officers absconded has forced INEC to suspend collation. When contacted, INEC spokesperson in Kano Mohammed Garba Lawal told The Guardian that the only Kano Resident Electoral Officer has the authority to explain the development.
