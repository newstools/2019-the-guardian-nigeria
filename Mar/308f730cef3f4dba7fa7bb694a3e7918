 PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan  The party, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, said the election should be cancelled because of  the disruption and bloodletting that characterised it. Ologbondiyan alleged that  all material facts on the supplementary election in Kano state showed how thugs violently took over polling units, attacked and chased away voters and engaged in massive thumb-printing and ballot stuffing. “INEC is already aware that the Police arrested a Commissioner and some thugs in Yelwa in Dala Local Government Area of the state. “Also INEC is already aware of how  thugs attacked voters in polling units in Gama area of Kano state during which four PDP members were feared killed and many more injured before they carted away ballot boxes for stuffing. “The PDP cautions INEC to note that in this circumstance, any results they come out with from this convoluted electoral process will be a sham and will surely be rejected by the people of Kano state,” he said. Ologbondiyan said it was completely condemnable that the opposition and its candidate would resort to violence as a means of attempting to hold on to power. He said that the PDP  grew Nigeria’s democracy for 16 years without watering the quest for power with the blood of the innocent as witnessed  in the 2019 general elections. “The PDP therefore charges INEC to save the nation from crisis by cancelling the Kano Supplementary election, as failure to do so is not in the best interest of our dear nation,” he added.
