Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, has said the Southwest is losing out from the nation’s Commonwealth due to the nonchalant attitude of its political leaders to some of the largesse being tapped by states from other zones. Fayemi, who cited the Anchor Borrower money being managed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to buttress his assertion, said the Development Agenda for Western Nigeria (DAWN) must be rejigged to meet the purpose for which it was established. He spoke, yesterday, in Ado Ekiti at a national retreat with the theme: Sustaining Yorubaness within Nigeria Circle, held by Afenifere Renewal Group (ARG). He warned Yoruba race not to allow politics get in the way of its regional integration, saying, “It is not a sin to belong to different political parties. It is what we bring to the people that matters.” He said he had already discussed with Oyo State governor-elect, Seyi Makinde, and that doing so was not anti-party. “We won’t throw him out of the rooftops because he is not in APC. We will support him,” he said. On restructuring, the governor said the Yoruba race needs to be more tactical, if it is desirous of actualising its advocacy on the issue. Fayemi urged proponents of the policy in the region to change strategy and reach out to other regions on how to actualise the dream of Nigeria being restructured economically and politically. The governors of Ondo and Osun States, Rotimi Akeredolu and Gboyega Oyetola said all the distinguishable traits of the Southwest region initiated during the old Western Region must be brought back in the zone’s interest.
