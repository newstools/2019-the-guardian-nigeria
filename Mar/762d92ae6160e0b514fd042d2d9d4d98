Nigerian media personality, Daddy Freeze who has always been vocal about his criticism of pastors and their teachings of the Bible has reacted to a recent claim by the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye. Adeboye in a tweet shared on RCCG official Twitter page had said that God joined him for breakfast and drank tea with him. He wrote, “You don’t have to believe me, but, God has joined me in having breakfast before.
He drank tea with me. I call Him “Daddy” because we share a very special relationship.
Prayers prayed tonight will be answered by fire. @PastorEAAdeboye
#SwimmingInGlory3 #EAA77.” Freeze replied, “I am glad you know this, because we don’t and we won’t! You should have taken a selfie with him like some of your South African colleagues did. Birthdays are of pagan origin. Matthew 14: 13, As soon as Jesus heard the news, he left in a boat to a remote area to be alone.” This is not the first time Freeze would openly criticise Adeboye and other clerics.
