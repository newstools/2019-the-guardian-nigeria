 Mike Tyson  According to the promoter, who is also the CEO of Green Studio, Savlo Montrond, the names of the top boxers in the title fight will be unveiled next month in an international world conference in Nigeria. He said the Africa heavyweight fight was last held in Cape Verde and won by Junior Maximus, who defeated Fasila Arrumi. Montrond noted that his company decided to bring the fight to Nigeria in conjunction with the Ooni of Ife Global Outreach as part of efforts to develop boxing in Nigeria, adding that he has a five-year plan to keep bringing in top fights to Nigeria to give hope to the sport, which has produced talents in Africa over the years. “The African heavyweight title is currently vacant and my organisation is bringing the fight here in Nigeria. When the event was held in Cape Verde, over 5000 spectators and wide range of viewers watched the fight live across the world. The Prince of Bahrain and Mike Tyson were among the top dignitaries who attended the event in Cape Verde. They have also  accepted to be in Nigeria and we are working hard to ensure that different countries in the world view the fight live on TV, as a way to revamp boxing in Nigeria,” he said. Montrond added, “Six fighters will be unveiled next month with a Nigerian among them. Apart from the top fight, we will have other bouts on that day, which are African super weight title fight, world and cruiserweight title. Top Nigerian and American musicians would be on ground to thrill the fans at the event. More fights will also be held in Lagos and other parts of the country in future,” he said.
