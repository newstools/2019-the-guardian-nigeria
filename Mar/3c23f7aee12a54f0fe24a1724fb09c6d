 Senate President, Bukola Saraki  Saraki in a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Yusuph Olaniyonu, said the late Elebute, the proprietor of Lagoon Group of Hospitals, was a source of inspiration both to him and millions of health professionals across the world. He commiserated with the immediate family of the deceased, the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) and the people and government of Ogun and Lagos States over the irreparable loss. “Elebute was my mentor and personal example. He was humble and unassuming. He was a Doctor’s doctor, a physician of repute, a medical teacher and an author of many medical texts and publications. “His service to Nigeria through the medical profession is immeasurable. We shall miss him dearly,” Saraki stated. He prayed for the peaceful repose of the soul of the deceased and called on his family and loved ones to sustain the sterling legacy of their departed patriarch.
