Nigerian singer and politician, 9ice may have just thrown shade at a national leader and chieftain of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. This seeming shade is coming as 9ice fondly referred to as “Alapomeji” by fans threw his weight behind the Lagos State gubernatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Jimi Agbaje. In his Instagram post, 9ice called on Lagosians to vote for Agbaje in today’s governorship election in Lagos State. According to 9ice, people might refer to Agbaje as a regular customer in terms of losing elections in the Lagos state but the godfather whom such people look up to was not known a few years back. 9ice wrote, “VOTE JIMI AGBAJE. THEM THEY CALL AM REGULAR CUSTOMER BUT THEIR GOD FATHER NOBODY KNOW AM 10-15YEARS AGO. ENYIN LON DAKUKO!!!” It is noteworthy that 9ice used to be a member of the APC until he failed to clinch the party’s ticket for the House of representatives. He lost to Prince Akeem Oyewunmi at the primaries conducted in 2015 and he is now seen campaigning on social media for the PDP.
