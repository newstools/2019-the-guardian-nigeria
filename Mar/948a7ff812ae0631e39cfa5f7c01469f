Jordyn Woods’ interview on Red Table Talk with Jada Pinkett Smith and Adrienne Banfield-Norris has been released. In the episode, Woods sat down to give her own account of the night she and Tristan Thompson allegedly became intimate. She explained that on the night in question, after she went to dinner and a bar with some friends, the group said they were going to Thompson’s house, and Woods joined them. “Feels like a safe environment,” Woods recalled. “I’d rather it be his house than a random stranger.” “He didn’t even personally invite me there. It wasn’t like, ‘Come see me’—it was like, ‘Oh I’m hopping in the car, I’m coming with y’all,’” she said. “I know him, even better.” She continued, “When it comes to the phones being taken away, I have no clue. … All I know is I had my own. … We’re all enjoying the time and I’m not thinking ‘I shouldn’t be here.’ And that’s my first step where I went wrong, and how I would feel if someone close to me is hanging out at my ex’s house, or the father of my child. I didn’t think about that.” Watch full interview via link below; https://web.facebook.com/redtabletalk/videos/416230735613094/
