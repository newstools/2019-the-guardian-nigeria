Trucks parked indiscriminately at Liverpool, Apapa The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) says introduction of holding bay and an electronic call-up system among articulated vehicles can easily address the usual Apapa gridlocks in Lagos State. Mr Hyginus Omeje, the FRSC Lagos State Sector Commander, made the assertion on Wednesday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. “Until the permanent solution is found, Lagosians will continue to experience these gridlocks at the Apapa area of the state. What is the permanent solution? “Holding bays, where these trucks can go in and park; from there, they get an electronic call-up for loading and the trucks can be moving into the ports in a segmented manner,” he said. According to him, if you have a truck, it behoves on you to have a holding bay where the vehicles will be parked before going into the port. The FRSC chief said that some of the transport companies outside Lagos do not have parks like holding bay within Lagos. “So, when they come to Lagos to load and it is not yet their turn, it becomes a problem,” Omeje added. He said there should be ease of doing business within Apapa port area, saying that business operations in our port should be seamless. Omeje said that relevant agencies were now making efforts to ease off the bottleneck as many factors needed to be considered. He also said that agencies were now in synergy with fleet operators and unions on ways to find a lasting solution to the menace of indiscriminate parking on the highways and on the bridges. The sector commander said that the bad road network was also a contributing factor to the usual gridlocks. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
