PHOTO: FLICKR Former Golden Eaglets coach, Fanny Amun has challenged the management of the National Institute for Sports (NIS) to be ingenious in generating its own revenue, instead of depending totally on the government for its budgetary allocation. Amun gave the suggestion while delivering his lecture themed: “Activating Sports Potentials: Quality, Economy and Lifestyle” at the NIS Silver Jubilee and Award Gala Night at the Civic Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos. Before Amun’s speech, the Director, NIS, Dr. Eke Kingdom had urged government to increase its budgetary allocation and staff overhead. But Amun urged the NIS to emulate other organisations that are ingenious in funding themselves, saying, “If ICAN, NBA, Federal Inland Revenue can generate funds on their own and make money, NIS can do so too.” He also pointed out another avenue through which NIS could generate revenue, which he said is by partnering various corporate organisations. Amun encouraged the management of the institution to pursue the accreditation of NIS vigorously, adding that it would be a springboard for growth of the institute. According to him, now is the time to lay the issue of accreditation on the table of the Youths and Sports Minister, Solomon Dalung, so that he could facilitate the accreditation process of NIS. “You have the Sports Minister, Solomon Dalung and the Permanent Secretary, Mr. Adesola Olusola here. I believe the institute will be better valued if you are accredited.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
