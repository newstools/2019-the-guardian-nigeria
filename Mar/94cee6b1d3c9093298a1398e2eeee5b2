International Observers, Pan African Women (PAN), have appealed to the President Muhammadu Buhari to review the Amended Electoral Act. Publicity Secretary to PAN, Mphoentle Keitseng, who monitored the general elections on Saturday in Akwa Ibom made this known to Journalists in Uyo. According to her, the bill will help regulate electoral processes in the country, adding that there were lot of irregularities at the polls on Saturday as observed by her. Keitseng further suggested that an electoral tribunal should be setup so that electoral offenders would  be punished in accordance with the laws. She berated the heavily armed security at the polling units, which according to her brings fear to the hearts of the voters present. She also urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to improve on their arrival to polling units. She, therefore, commended INEC for the transparency in the Saturday election in the state. “We commend the transparent and credibility exhibited by INEC in Akwa Ibom in conducting free, fair Presidential/National Assembly and Gubernatorial/State House of Assembly elections,” she said.
