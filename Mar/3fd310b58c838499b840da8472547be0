Veteran Nigerian music star, Femi Kuti in a recent disclosure has made it known that he lost his first Grammy nomination in 2003 due to politics.
The artist who was on the verge of bringing home a Grammy to Nigeria with his album, Fight To Win told PulseTV that he got nominated at a time when he was having
issues with his former record company, MCA in France. Fight To Win was nominated under the “Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording”, and according to him, “When I was nominated for the Grammy the first time, I was basically going to win, it was a super album”.  He further explained that after he sacked his manager and also quit the record company, he got blacklisted which earned him his loss.
