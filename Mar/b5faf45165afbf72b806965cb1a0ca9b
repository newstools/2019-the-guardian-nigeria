There have been speculations for months now that actors Yvonne Jegede and Olakunle “Abounce” Fawole‘s marriage was in crisis. Jegede has now confirmed that they are no longer living together and have gone their separate ways in an interview with Pulse. “We started having issues before the birth of Xavier (their son). I think I was about two to three months pregnant when the issues came. Immediately the issues came, there was never a dull moment, it just kept going up and up and it got worse and it got bad and today here we are,” she said. She continued: “Right now, we are not living together, and we are not living as husband and wife, we are not husband and wife anymore and I would say a mutual agreement to go our separate ways. It didn’t work out, it wasn’t working out.” Jegede also went to clear the air on the paternity of her son Xavier, saying Abounce “is 100% sure he’s his son”.  The couple got married in 2017 and welcomed Xavier in November 2018.
