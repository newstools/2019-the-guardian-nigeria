“Fancy” hitmaker, Iggy Azalea will surely be catching your attention with her latest release titled “Sally Walker”. The 28-year-old leaves heart racing with the grim yet steamy visual for “Sally Walker”. Iggy can be seen twerking up a storm on the hood of a car as she also puts her banging body on display in a series of revealing outfits. The grim visual shows the Australia native serving up her best dance moves yet as a funeral procession follows behind her.  For the video, Azalea also enlists the help of a few famous friends and fans of RuPaul’s Drag Race may recognize Shea Couleé, Mayhem Miller and Miss Vanjie throughout the video. The grim video lightens up by the end of the three-minute spectacle when Iggy delivers some more upbeat bars. The new track, “Sally Walker” is the first single from Azalea’s upcoming new album, “In My Defense”. Watch the video below:
