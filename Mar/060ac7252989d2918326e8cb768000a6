76-year-old eight times Oscar award-winning actress, Barbra Streisand has come under fire from angry fans after making confusing statements about Michael Jackson and his alleged abuse victims in a new interview. The actress’ reaction to HBO’s controversial documentary “Leaving Neverland”, which featured the accounts of Michael Jackson‘s alleged abuse victims Wade Robson and James Safechuck has attracted heat because fans believe she’s defending Jackson’s alleged actions and minimising the effect it had on Wade and James. Speaking about the documentary, she told The Times in an interview published on March 22, “[Michael’s] sexual needs were his sexual needs, coming from whatever childhood he has or whatever DNA he has.” Streisand clarified that she “absolutely” believes the pop icon’s accusers and said their stories were “too painful”. She said, “You can say ‘molested,’ but those children, as you heard say [the grown-up Robson and Safechuck], they were thrilled to be there. They both married and they both have children, so it didn’t kill them.” Streisand went on to put the blame on Robson and Safechuck’s parents. “It’s a combination of feelings. I feel bad for the children. I feel bad for [Michael]. I blame, I guess, the parents, who would allow their children to sleep with him,” she told The Times. As soon as the interview emerged online, fans shared their outrage on Twitter with many accusing Streisand of justifying Jackson’s alleged actions in her interview. It would be recalled that the late Jackson and Streisand were often photographed together before the “Thriller” hitmaker died.
