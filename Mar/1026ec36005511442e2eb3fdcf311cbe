The Super Eagles welcome Seychelles to the southeastern city of Asaba on March 22 in a final 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier and four days later they take on Egypt in a friendly at the same venue. Mikel has not played for Nigeria since the team exited the 2018 World Cup at the group stage in Russia in June. However, he has been on superb form for promotion-seeking Middlesbrough in the English second division since his recent return from China in January. Nigeria have also called up two uncapped players for these matches – Valentine Ozornwafor, who shone at the recent U20 African Championship in Niger and Paul Onuachu, who has been a consistent scorer for Danish club FC Midtjylland. Leicester City forward, Kelechi Iheanacho, who is having a rough patch in the Premier League, was not invited to the squad for both games. The Super Eagles have already qualified for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations set to hold in Egypt.
