Fixes March 9 for re-run in Zaki local council
The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is yet to declare the result of Zaki Federal Constituency in Bauchi State over election issues in the area. The state’s Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Alhaji Ibrahim Abdullahi, said that the commission cancelled results of five polling units in different electoral wards in the area over reported electoral misconducts. The REC, who stated this yesterday during a stakeholders’ meeting to review the presidential and National Assembly elections held on Saturday, February 23, 2019, said all the three senatorial results were successfully declared and returned, attributing the success to the combine efforts of the political leaders, security forces, observer groups, traditional and religious leaders and journalists who ensured peace reigned. Also, the electoral body is yet to begin the issuance of certificates of return to elected senators and members of the House of Representatives. This may not be unconnected with the inconclusive elections in some states across the federation due to insecurity and other factors that characterised the polls. The Chief Press Secretary to INEC chairman, Rotimi Oyekanmi, in his reaction, could not be explicit as to the delay in the issuance of certificates of return.He, however, promised to get details from the RECs and get back to The Guardian but was yet to do so at the time of filing in this report.
