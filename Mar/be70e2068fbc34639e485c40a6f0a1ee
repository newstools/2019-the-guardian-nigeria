Relief may soon come the way of women as lawyers began an awareness campaign for  implementation of the provisions of law on gender discrimination, especially as regards women traditional inheritance. 
 
At the maiden colloquium of Epiphany Azinge Foundation held last week in Abuja, the convener of the programme and former Director General, Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, Professor Epiphany Azinge, described the continuous discrimination against women on the basis of gender as an anomaly. 
 
Titled, “Women traditional inheritance in Nigeria: Breaking the Barriers of Gender Discrimination”, the roundtable brought together legal luminaries, gender enthusiasts and members of the academia to chart a way forward.Some of them include the Dean of law faculty, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Professor Joy Ezeilo; Chief James Onoja (SAN); Professor Nnamdi Aduba, Chief Rita Garuba as well as  Mrs. Onikepo Braithwaite.  Also at the event was the Executive Secretary, National Human Rights Commission, Mr. Tony Ojukwu.  “More importantly, mothers should also rise up to the responsibility because in most of these moves, if the mothers do not assert their authorities, their husbands will never get to understand that they are not doing the right thing. “The judiciary has done its work; it is now left for the society to see how they can work towards applying Supreme Court’s pronouncements on in the case of Ukeje vs Ukeje”, Azinge stated.
