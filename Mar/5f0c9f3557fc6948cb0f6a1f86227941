Justice Walter Onnoghen The Code of Conduct Tribunal has adjourned hearing on the trial of suspended Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Walter Onnoghen, till next Monday, March 18, 2019 over ill- health. At the resumed hearing yesterday, Chairman of the tribunal, Danladi Umar, observed that Onnoghen was not in court to face his trial. The lead defence counsel, Chief Adegboyega Awomolo (SAN), told the court that Justice Onnoghen was absent on health ground. According to him, the suspended CJN was suffering from toothache. And to buttress his position, Awomolo presented a medical report signed by Onnoghen’s doctor and Medical Director, Ideal Medical Services, Dr. Francis Uche. He said the doctor had recommended that Justice Onnoghen should observe a 72-hour bed rest for his high blood pressure to be properly monitored. In his reaction, the prosecution counsel, Aliyu Umar (SAN), upheld the reason given by the defence counsel. He admitted that the reason for the defendant’s absence in court was cogent enough. He added that since his doctor requested that Onnoghen should observe some rest, and also considering his age, it was only necessary that the tribunal should adjourn sitting to enable the defendant recover fully and resume trial. In his ruling, Justice Umar held that in view of the medical report and the prosecution’s stand that Onnoghen’s health is important, and also considering his age and other issues raised in the medical report, the matter stands adjourned till March 18, 2019 at the instance of the defendant.
