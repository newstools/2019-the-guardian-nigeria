Lobi Stars coach, Ogbeide, expressed confidence that his team must get a victory in the match. ”We have done all that is necessary to have the three points against the visitors, we are prepared to put smile in the faces of Nigerians. ”Remember that we have played ASEC before in their home and lost by 1-0 when we do not have much information about them. ”There are no two matches that are alike and we have gotten their weak and strength side so we are going to capitalised on it to beat them,” he said. He said that they lost to Mamelodi Sundown because their plans was shattered when they learned that one of their best midfielder Alex Otakho is ineligible. ”Lobi did well in Casablanca and was thrown off balance in South Africa because we already planned our game for the match. ”It was only in South Africa that we were informed that Alex Otakho was ineligible owing to double yellow card. ”This made me to lack the needed energy at the midfield and I believe that we have learnt a lot in the course of this CAF competition,” Ogbeide said.
