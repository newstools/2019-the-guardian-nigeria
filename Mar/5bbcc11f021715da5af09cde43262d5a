Mountain of Fire and Miracles Football Club (MFM FC) utility player, Chijioke Akuneto has said that today’s Match Day 11 (second round) fixture of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) against Bendel Insurance is a must win game for his side. The Olukoya Boys currently top of the NPFL Group A table with 18 points, after securing six victories and three losses, would have the opportunity to extend their lead against the “Benin Arsenal,” who are third from bottom with nine points. They have recorded just one victory, six draws and two defeats. Speaking to The Guardian yesterday, ahead of the clash that is scheduled for the Temple Stadium in Agege, Lagos State, Akuneto declared that nothing would stop them from winning today’s encounter against the Benin boys. “Definitely the match is going to be a win for us by the grace of God. We have a team made of young and talented boys, who are ready to excel and make name for themselves too. “These new players, I can tell you, are ready to learn and fill the vacuum left by the mass exodus. With hard work and determination, I believe we will overcome the challenge of Bendel Insurance in today’s game God’s willing,” he said. Last season, a large number of experienced players left MFM team for greener pasture.The versatile player, one of the few old horses, who decided to stay back and help the Coach Fidelis Ilechukwu-led young team, has been operating as an offensive midfielder and as a forward, equally appealed to fans of the club to come out en mass and contribute their support to surmount their opponent in today’s epic match. “God has been wholesome in all our fixtures, especially in our home games where we haven’t lost a game. And that is why our Agege fans need to come out in their large numbers to cheer us to victory. They should have it at the back of their minds that victory is assured by God’s grace,” he stated.
