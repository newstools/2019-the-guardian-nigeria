Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has released Atiku Abubakar’s son-in-law Babalele Abdullahi. Abdullahi, who has been in EFCC custody over allegations of money laundering, was freed by the commission after Tanimu Turaki’s arrest. Turaki, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), leading the defense team of Atiku and also deputy director-general of the PDP Presidential Campaign Organisation was invited by the anti-graft agency to sign bail documents for Abdullahi. He was also detained in the process. PDP, therefore, reacted to Turaki’s arrest as a staged plan by Buhari and his cabal to intimidate the their leaders by using power from above. Kola Ologbondiyan, the party spokesman, in a statement, said the arrest of Takuri is to scuttle PDP’s fight reclaim February 23, 2019 Presidential election victory in court. “Since the people’s candidate, Atiku Abubakar and the PDP expressed our unwavering determination to reclaim our victory at the tribunal, being armed with overwhelming evidence, our leaders have been subjected to escalated harassments, constant threats, blackmails, cajoling and contrivances by the APC to drop our legal option,” Ologbondiyan said. He further warned the opposition party that no harassment or threat can stop them from taking back the mandate. “The PDP, however, states in clear terms that the APC and the Buhari Presidency are fighting a lost battle as no amount of harassment and threats will ever make the party to buckle in its determination to take back the mandate, in line with the wishes and aspirations of Nigerians.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
