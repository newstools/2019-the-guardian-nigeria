Rapper Offset recently explained why he publicly apologised to wife Cardi B following a cheating scandal. The 27-year-old father-of-four, in an interview on Ellen DeGeneres‘ show, explained that his public apologies hadn’t been down with the intention of gaining public support but more because he and Cardi have really tight schedules and he wasn’t ready to wait for a free time before saying how sorry he was. He says that as a man, he just had to step up and make the apologies. Watch below.   Wherever @offsetyrn’s father is, I hope he watches this.
