The Plea on Oath, written by Lornamarie (Lorna Betty Ibidun Marjorie Adekaiyaoja), is a debut exposit legal crime fiction on the miscarriage of justice in the modern world, and the role that lawyers, judges and the criminal justice system have to play in it. Lornamarie in this twisty thriller, gripping, giddy style skilfully narrated the life of a man who practised his profession excellently well until his private life interfered with his success in all its ramifications. It is the story of a bright and gifted boy, Segun, that will grip you as you read about how he grew up to become a doctor. It tells of his hard work with not so much to show for it as he struggled and battled his addiction to gambling with adverse consequences leaving a vacuum in his life. The author keeps you in suspense as the intriguing story unfolds. Segun lived his life like a Candle in the Wind with his struggle and fought back from the edge of death, his recovery and then back to the inevitable end. Doctors are human, and so are we all. You are glued to the book from the beginning right to the end as it exposes not only addiction to alcohol, drugs and gambling but also challenges that couples face in a marriage like childlessness and the consequences in various societies, infertility in marriages and treatment through in vitro fertilisation. Lornamarie used the humanitarian story to plead for a change to current American gun law with a hope that unfortunate stories similar to the storyline could be prevented to make the world a better place to live. The book touched on real-life issues such as miscarriage of justice, reckless endangerment with a firearm, dealing with grief, corruption, racism, counselling and rehabilitation â€” the use of alibi, insanity, depression and poor mental state as a defence during the criminal trial.
It is a well-known fact that the greatest dramas occur not on screens or stages, but rather in some courtrooms scenes, Lornamarie, in The Plea on Oath, brings these dramas alive. This legal crime fiction thriller is a blast and everything a great thriller should be. It kept the readers knowledgeable on the dangers of blackmailing, extortion, manslaughter and murder with exposure to the difference between the two using court judgement by the trial court and decision of the appellate court to reach a manslaughter verdict quashing a murder conviction. The book is a must read.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
