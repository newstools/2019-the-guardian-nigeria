In a recent chat with Hollywood Life, Trace Cyrus, the brother to singer and actress, Miley Cyrus has revealed why the star and her husband, Liam Hemsworth are perfect for each other. According to Trace who is getting ready for his DJ performance series at The Barbershop Cuts and Cocktails venue in Vegas said, “I think just trial and error,” Trace said at The Barbershop’s opening. “From an outsiders perspective, I’ve met them both, obviously. She’s just so cool and chill and down to earth and I feel like he’s like that too. They just fit perfectly together. They’re both just so cool and so nice and just down to earth people.” On whether Miley and Hemsworth would start trying to have a baby soon, Trace replied, “No, She has so much time to decide that. She hasn’t even hit her dirty 30 yet.” It would be recalled that after Miley and Hemsworth got married on December 24, 2018, Miley discussed how her new marital status does not change the fact that she continues to identify as queer. “But, I think the reason we got married isn’t old-fashioned,” she told Vanity Fair. “I actually think it’s kind of New Age. We’re redefining, to be f***ing frank, what it looks like for someone that’s a queer person like myself to be in a hetero relationship.”
