The Egyptian Football Association (EFA) is optimistic the Pharaohs will prevail against the Super Eagles in the March 26 International friendly scheduled for the Stephen Keshi stadium in Asaba, Delta State. Both countries had already qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) before the last qualifiers. Nigeria tops group E with 10 points, while Egypt with 12 points are second behind Tunisia in group J, as the tournament commences on June 21 till July 13 in Egypt after Cameroun was stripped of the initial hosting rights due to unpreparedness. The Egyptians, who are on the road against the Niger Republic slated for the Stade Général S. k. Stadium in Niamey today, is one of the last fixtures of the AFCON. Mexican coach, Javier Aguirre had already unveiled the 25-man squad for the epic encounter, as stars like Liverpool’s forward, Mohamed Salah, West Bromwich Albion stopper, Ahmed Hegazi and Aston Villa’s Ahmed Elmohamady were omitted, among others, who won’t be in Asaba for the friendly. Aguirre named a 25-man squad, including 10 new faces, but left out Liverpool winger, Mohamed Salah, West Bromwich Albion stopper, Ahmed Hegazi and Aston Villa’s Ahmed Elmohamady to rest. “Egypt will be hosted by Niger in their final qualifier today, before they face the Super Eagles away in a friendly four days later, and the country’s football federation is backing the coach and players to win. “Coach Javier Aguirre kicked off the camp with a meeting with the players. The coach spent time, stressing full concentration and doing one’s best effort during the coming days.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
