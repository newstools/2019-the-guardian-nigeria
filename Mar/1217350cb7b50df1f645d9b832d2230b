 Emeka Ihedioha  Nwafor stated this to The Guardian at his Owerri office also rated the performance of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the 2019 general elections in the state below average. The Imo APC Chair also accused the State INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) Francis Ezeonu of compromising on his legitimate duty as an election umpire. He expressed regret over the inability of the party to win a single seat in the State House of Assembly at the just concluded poll in the state stressing that the National Executive of the party led by Adams Oshiomhole should be blamed for it. According to him, if the party hierarchy had listened to his cries of the visible illegality and leadership rascality in the party, the imminent collapse of the party in the state would have been averted. He also said the party is still hopeful that INEC will be compelled by the court to issue the Certificate of Return to Governor Rochas Anayo Okorocha as Imo West senator elect having been declared as the winner by the Commission. “Indeed, INEC performance was embarrassing. You see the problem is that in 2023, if we don’t check injustice, people will sit in their bedrooms and just fill out forms and announce themselves as winners. That is where our democracy is heading to if we don’t fight to bring back sanity in the electoral system.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
