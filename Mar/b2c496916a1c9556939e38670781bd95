 Georgia Oboh  Oboh entered her second LET competition at the Women’s NSW Open at Queanbeyan Golf Club in Australia yesterday after failing to make the cut in her first outing in Canberra last week. Reflecting on her nascent professional career, which has so far taken her to competitions in Cote d’Ivoire, the Sunshine Tour in South Africa and now Australia, Oboh said she has become a better player despite the setbacks. “I am not worried about my performance so far this season,” she said. “I see this as a stepping stone to greater things… it is a learning experience and I have learnt many lessons so far and I plan to apply those lessons into my game in the coming weeks. “My target is to become the LET rookie of the year, to play in the British Ladies Open and the Evian Championships, as well as to attain full membership status on the LET,” she said.She admits that her undoing so far has been her inexperience, adding that she was working hard to correct her shortcomings.
 “Some of the major challenges I am having are due to my inexperience. The courses I am playing are new to me but at the same time I can only put the work in and leave the rest to God. “I intend to overcome these challenges by practicing and having the patience to make the right decisions at the right time. “I will also put more work into my game and depend on the grace of God to play more tournaments.” The former World Teen champion believes she has the ability to become one of the best players in the world, adding, “at the end of 2019, I see myself in the top 500 in Rolex ranking and in position for the 2020 Olympics, rookie of the year LET and a few major tournaments under my belt.” The Women’s NSW Open teed off from the ninth hole yesterday.
