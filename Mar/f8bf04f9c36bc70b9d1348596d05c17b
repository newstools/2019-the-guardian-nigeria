We are pleased to announce the April 1, 2019 release date for the Nigerian edition of Black Leopard, Red Wolf, a novel by Marlon James. This is the first book in a trilogy, which the author has described as an African “Game of Thrones”. Black Leopard, Red Wolf, follows the story of Tracker, a hunter, who is known throughout the thirteen kingdoms as one who has a nose — and he always works alone. But he breaks his own rule when, hired to find a lost child, he finds himself part of a group of hunters all searching for the same boy. Each of these companions is stranger and more dangerous than the last, from a giant to a witch to a shape-shifting Leopard, and each has secrets of their own. As the mismatched gang follow the boy’s scent, from perfumed citadels to infested rivers to the enchanted darklands and beyond, set upon at every turn by creatures intent on destroying them, Tracker starts to wonder: who is this mysterious boy? Why do so many people want to stop him being found? And, most important of all, who is telling the truth and who is lying? <img class="size-large wp-image-884548 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/BLRW-1258x1152.jpg" alt="" width="1258" height="1152" /> Drawing from African history and mythology and his own rich imagination, Marlon James weaves a tapestry of breathtaking adventure through a world at once ancient and startlingly modern. And, against this exhilarating backdrop of magic and violence, he explores the fundamentals of truth, the limits of power, the excesses of ambition, and our need to understand them all.  Hollywood actor, Michael B. Jordan (Black Panther) recently acquired the rights to produce a film adaptation of the book through his movie production company, “Outlier Society”.
