Operatives of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) have arrested the leader of a four-man fraud syndicate, Chibuzor Osuji. Osuji allegedly confessed to RRS that his gang members comprising Frank, Stella and Emeka, daily lured suspects, who they tricked into their dollar-making scam. The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Zubairu Muazu, in a statement said his men are on the lookout to arrest other gang members as soon as possible. The RRS said Osuji and his team members operate in Ikeja, Ojota, Ojodu, Berger, Ogba, College Road and Agege. Osuji was reportedly nabbed after their victim lured him into the waiting hands of police officers after his gang had swindled the 34-year-old woman of N165,000. “Although there are many gangs that operate in the axis my gang has only four members,” Osuji said. RRS said Osuji role was to deceitfully prophesy for victims after they must have been lured into their offices at 8, Afolabi Street, Iju Shaga and 7, Salami Street, Oko Oba, Agege. The gang was said to have used fake dollars to hoodwink their victims. The statement said after luring the victim to their office, he (Osuji) would be invited as a pastor to pray for the victim. “After collecting N165,000 they still would not let me rest. I borrowed N60,000 being the balance of what they needed. I was on the way to hand it over to them when I regained my consciousness,” the victim said. “Luckily for me, with the assistance of a patrol team of RRS men, I was able to lure him out of their office before getting him arrested.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
