The importance of sports to all round development of a child was once again in focus at the just concluded Triennial inter-house sport competition of Unique Group of Schools, Lagos. The event held at Agege Stadium witnessed students competing in different athletics, march past, football among others. Speaking at the event, the Head of School, Mr. Gbenga Kareem said physical education is part of the education system that is important to the well being of every child, adding that the school place premium on it. “Aside from academics which is very important to the growth of every child, they need to be fit and have this part of exercise to keep their body and soul together as well as all round development,” he said. Kareem advised parents to compliment their efforts by allowing children to pursue their God-given talents. “It is not all of them that will be big men and women with their pens, some will use their legs, some their hands while some will use other skills God bequeath to them,” he said. Kareem also urged government to pump more money into sports because this is one part of the economy they were not looking at which is vital to the nation’s development. The school’s principal, Mrs. Oluwakemi Onochie in her remarks said the cognitive aspect of learning is always emphasised in education but to have a total child, “it is important to also engage the children in the psychomotor aspect of learning. She charged parents to support children who want to make a career in sports so that they may excel in their chosen profession.
