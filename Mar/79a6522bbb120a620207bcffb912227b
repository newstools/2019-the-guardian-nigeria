The movie tells the story a broke lady, who plays into the manipulation of her friend to impersonate her deceased twin sister so as to inherit her riches, she must be entangled in her sister’s love triangle along with the demons inside. In a chat with showbiz reporter, Nnadi, who recently put to bed, said, “This is actually my third movie, but it’s the first one going to the cinemas. We shot the movie here in Lekki, Lagos for eight days. I spent N12 million filming it after which I discovered I was pregnant. I had to put a hold on the postproduction until I had my baby. Now, I’m fully back to the industry.” On how she arrived at the cast for the movie, she explained, “We wanted to make sure that every character on this particular project is someone that can interpret the script; that’s why we did our cast that way. We could have just picked anybody to take a role, but we took our time to cast for the roles. If you don’t interpret a role in the movie, as far as I’m concerned, people will not understand what they are watching.” Speaking on her experience on set shooting Being Anable, Nnadi said, “Well, I won’t say it was bad but thank God, as the executive producer, I’m happy that I was on set. You know, even when you have a producer, what you want is what you want. I had a producer on set, but at the end of the day, it came out fine. I just want to leave it to the public to judge,” she said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
