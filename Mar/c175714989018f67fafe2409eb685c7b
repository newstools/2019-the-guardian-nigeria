R. Kelly has defended himself for going on air to tell his side of the story. Sources close to him say that the reason he reached out to Gayle King in the now infamous R. Kelly interview is because his “spirit” convinced him to do it. As someone who claims to be in constant touch with his spirit, he thought it wise to speak with his fans. For all its worth especially in this part of the world, it is a valid reason. And if you were wondering how he feels about people’s opinion on his reveal, he “zero f***s” about that. In the meantime, he is focused on making music.
