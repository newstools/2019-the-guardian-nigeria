It appears there just might still be a glimmer of hope for former best friends, Kylie Jenner and Jordyn Woods. This is coming after the two of them were spotted having breakfast together and deep in conversation. The breakfast meeting may be their way of trying to salvage their relationship in the wake of Woods’ betrayal when she shared a kiss with Kylie’s sister, Khloe Kardashian’s baby daddy, Tristan Thompson. According to a report by E! News, an eyewitness reports that the makeup mogul and her childhood friend were at the Calabasas restaurant Pedalers Fork on Friday morning. “It seemed very casual and they both were having a discussion together while eating,” the eyewitness shares. It is noteworthy that this is the first time that the two reality stars have met in public since the cheating scandal. It would be recalled that we reported that Woods moved out of Kylie’s Calabasas home, where she lived for over a year. However, when the 21-year-old went on Jada Pinkett-Smith’s show Red Table Talk, she maintained that she and Kylie were still in contact.
