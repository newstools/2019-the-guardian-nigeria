The late King of Pop, Michael Jackson who is currently in the eye of the storm after a controversial documentary, “Leaving Neverland” was released by HBO. The documentary alleges the multiple award-winning singer sexually abused two boys, Wade Robson and James Safechuck. Now a CCTV footage of the late singer allegedly shopping for wedding rings with a child while wearing a strange disguise has surfaced online. The footage is from 1989 and the “Billy Jean” crooner is seen browsing stalls in a jewellery shop with a little boy. The clip appears to be from a news report at the time and the journalist talks about Jackson being caught in a ‘shady disguise.’ Speaking about the incident of the “Liberian Girl” hitmaker reportedly found in the store, a security guard said, “It was about as cheap as you could get,” as he described the popstar’s stuck on moustache. He added, “Of course he had the wig on and a cheap hat. The disguise worked – he’d be the last person that we’d consider as Michael Jackson.” Another security guard claimed, “I asked, “Why are you in disguise?” and he said: “I am Michael Jackson.” ‘I was like “yeah, yeah, yeah you’re Michael Jackson.” The man went on to allege, “He said: “Really I am, see I have false teeth,” so he pulls his teeth out, and then he said, “and I have a wig on.” ‘And he pulled his hair up, and I saw his natural hair – and I knew then that that was him. That was the Michael Jackson.’ The video then shoots back to the studio with the news reporter adding, “Michael said he was shopping for a wedding ring. He says he plans to marry Sheryl Crow – one of his backup singers.” The footage comes after Channel 4 aired the Michael Jackson Leaving Neverland documentary where James Safechuck and Wade Robson accused the star of child sexual abuse. Safechuck claimed that Michael had held a fake wedding ceremony and he showed off the rings he claims Jackson bought him during Leaving Neverland.

We did this in his bedroom and we filled out some vows like we would be bonded forever.’ He added: ‘It felt good. And the ring is nice. It has a row of diamonds. The wedding ring.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-878723 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/James-Safechuck-showed-off-the-rings-he-claims-MJ-bought-him-during-Leaving-Neverland-Photo-HBO.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="799" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/James-Safechuck-showed-off-the-rings-he-claims-MJ-bought-him-during-Leaving-Neverland-Photo-HBO.jpg 540w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/James-Safechuck-showed-off-the-rings-he-claims-MJ-bought-him-during-Leaving-Neverland-Photo-HBO-487x304.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/James-Safechuck-showed-off-the-rings-he-claims-MJ-bought-him-during-Leaving-Neverland-Photo-HBO-320x200.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> It would be recalled that just recently, Jackson’s daughter, Paris Jackson said she knows her father is innocent of the allegations.
