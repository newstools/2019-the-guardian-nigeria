The Lagos  Government has debunked rumour stating that the Stateâ€™s governor Akinwunmi Ambode announced Friday March 8, 2019 as public holiday, for civil servants. According to the rumour which was trending on social media, the holiday was announced in order for citizens to prepare for the coming elections on March 9, 2019. Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Kehinde Bamigbetan, asserted that the report is false, noting that all workers are expected to be in their various offices on Friday. Bamigbetan, therefore, affirmed that all public and private schools in the state are to observe a compulsory mid-term break on Thursday and Friday in accordance with the revised calendar as earlier announced by the Deputy governor of Lagos state, Idiat Adebule.
