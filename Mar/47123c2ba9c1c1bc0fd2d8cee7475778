For a long time, the world labelled him an abuser. To prove his innocence, he slammed a $50 million defamation suit against her and produced 87 surveillance camera videos showing her violating him. Remember the video shows his cut finger? She did it. What is more? His infamous black eye picture was his punishment for not coming back on time on her 30th birthday. The truth will always prevail. Iyanya and Ubi Franklin | Instagram Nigerian music star, Iyanya who made some damning allegations against his former business partner, Ubi Franklin yesterday has now revealed more details. This is coming after Franklin fired back at Iyanya and branded the “Kukere” crooner a liar. Franklin had released documents to back up his claim showing that the documents carried Iyanya’s name (something Iyanya had denied). Reacting to this, Iyanya claims that the real deal at Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) has his name missing and Franklin’s brothers’ names were replaced with his. He further went on to allege that songstress, Emma Nyra was the one who coined the Triple MMMG.
