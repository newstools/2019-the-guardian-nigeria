Owoeye said without any formal complaint to IBEDC on electricity problems, hoodlums from Bolorunduro and Olomilagba communities stormed its three business hubs in Isare, Isokun and Oke-Omiru service units in Ilesa with dangerous weapons. “On Thursday, hoodlums attacked our staff with dangerous weapons, shot sporadically into the air before they forcefully gained access to the cash and carted away our money. “As a customer friendly company always ready to attend to customers’ complaints and resolve them, we are disappointed at this attitude of the hoodlums who put the lives of our staff at risk. “We urge the security agencies to bring the perpetrators of this dastardly act to book to serve as a deterrent to those who might want to trail the path of violence to express their grievances,” the statement said. According to the company, it is ready to serve its customers better, but cannot do that at the expense of the lives of its staff. It also urged IBEDC customers who have complains to always follow due process to channel their complaints, rather than engaging in acts of violence. The statement, however, said electricity distribution to the communities will be shut until the perpetrators were brought to justice and safety of its staff were guaranteed.
