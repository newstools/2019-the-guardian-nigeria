Chanel, on Tuesday, presented the final collection designed by its longtime creative director, Karl Lagerfeld, that moved the audience to tears. The brand’s Fall/Winter 2019 show took place at the Grand Palais in Paris, featuring a transformative set decorated as a glamorous winter ski wonderland, and filled with touching tributes to the late designer, Lagerfeld, who died at the age of 85 on February 19. A note with a sketch that Lagerfeld drew of himself and Chanel founder, Coco Chanel, with the words, “The beat goes on…” was placed on each attendees’ seat. And a minute of silence was observed before the show began, according to reports.   On each seat for the audience was a drawing by Karl of himself with Coco Chanel and the words: “The beat goes on”.
