MFM FC Coach Fidelis Ilechukwu of Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries Football Club wants nothing short of victory today, against the former champions, Enyimba Football Club of Aba, who have never been beaten by their hosts since promotion to top-flight football. Both teams will slug it out for the top spot of Group A of the league. Slated for the Temple Stadium, Agege, Olukoya Boys are currently topping the table with 22 points having played 12 matches, won seven and lost four games, while, the People’s Elephant are second with 19 points, and lost three from the same number of matches played. A win for the oriental club will, however, catapult them to the top of the group league. Speaking to the MFM FC Media on the importance of the match day 13 game of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) to the club, Ilechukwu declared that anything short of a win amounts to failure by MFM FC. “It’s a game we must win to remain at the top. We know their antics, we know their strengths and we know everything about Enyimba Football Club. I can tell you their possible line-up. “(Austine) Oladapo, (Abdulrahman) Bashir, (Thomas) Zenke, Onuwa (Chukwuka) and (Stanley) Okorom may likely start but we have prepared for them. So, anything less than three points is a failure. We have prepared for the game and we are waiting for them,” Ilechukwu said. The Nigeria’s U-23 assistant coach, who is aware of the Aba-based club away records, however, believes that his team will defeat their opponent and record first win against them. “I am aware that Enyimba is a technical side and also of their unbeaten run. MFM Football Club, we are number one on the log on merit and we are no push over, so come (Sunday) today, Enyimba must fall,” he stated.
