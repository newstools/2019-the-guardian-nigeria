Nollywood actress, Etinosa Idemudia, who was recently in the news for the wrong reason after she went naked on an Instagram Live broadcast on Nigerian singer, MC Galaxy’s page has explained the reason behind her action. According to the screen star, her embarrassing action was the resultant effect of alcohol and she should have been careful with her drink. It would be recalled that when she nudity scandal first broke out, Etinosa had insinuated she was drunk when she went naked on MC Galaxy’s Instagram live. In a chat with PulseTV, she expressed shock at how her video went out in public despite the fact it was supposed to be a private video. She said, “I don’t really know, I can’t say anything about the person who sent the video to Instablog or how it got there. Those things are private things. Your weakness should be covered but unfortunately for me, I happened to be out there. The people who are judging at the moment, I don’t really blame you guys, it’s fine because I put myself in the spot and I take full responsibility for the incident. I should have been more responsible, I should have been more careful with alcohol, with expressing myself and with whatever it is I want to do. All I have to do now is to ask God for forgiveness and move on.”
