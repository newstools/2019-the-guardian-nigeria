Georgia Oboh Fresh from her maiden outing at the Sunshine Tour in South Africa, Nigeria’s golf prodigy, Georgia Oboh has arrived in Canberra, Australia to debut in a Ladies European Tour tournament. The competition, the ActewAGL Classic, will hold at the Royal Canberra Golf Club in Canberra, Australia.
In her debut outing at the South African Women’s Masters, Oboh played her way into the cut where she eventually finished in the 27th position out of the 76 field of players in the three-day tournament held at the San Lameer Golf Club, Durban. South Africa’s Leján Lewthwaite won the competition with a dramatic play-off victory over young GolfRSA amateur, Kajal Mistry. Oboh, who had a disappointing first day with 80 at the South African Masters, firmly bounced back on day two with a score of 73 and on the final day, pulled out all stops to get into 27th position out of 67 ladies. The 18-year-old wants to continue her progression at the Ladies European Tour (LET), where she will meet some of the best players in the LET roster. She told The Guardian that she had been working her to overcome her slow start in major events, adding that playing against the top women in the world game has had a salutary effect on her confidence. “I want to thank all my supporters in Nigeria and all over the world. My mission is to continue to improve through hard work until I get to the summit of the game,” she said. Oboh is set to enter the record books as the first Nigerian lady golfer to compete on the Ladies European Tour having gained playing privileges at the Lalla Meryem Tour School in Morocco in December 2018.
