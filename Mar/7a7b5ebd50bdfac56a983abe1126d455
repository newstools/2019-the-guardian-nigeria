He said enforcing the national minimum wage was long overdue because workers have been patient enough, adding that the implementation at various levels should go on seamlessly. Waba lamented that inequality gap between the rich and the poor in Nigeria keeps expanding, stressing that there was need to empower workers so that democracy could work better for all Nigerians. On the new cabinet, Waba :, “President Buhari must be selective in bringing the team that will work with him. He must ensure that only people who have something to offer will be in the cabinet and not those who have impoverished the system.” Speaking, President of MHWUN, Comrade Josiah Biobelemoye, decried the embarrassing state of the country’s health sector, noting that appointment of minister to the Federal Ministry of Health must not necessarily be only health professionals so as to end politics of exclusion that has taken roots in the ministry.He pointed out that this would build confidence in Nigerians and make the operating environment more attractive since poor management and brain drain have been the country’s health sector’s major challenges.
