Guardian Life ‘Artist to watch’ Santi has recently just released visuals for his widely accepted single “Sparky”. The video comes one week after the release of the song on all platforms.
As per usual Santi standards, “Sparky” was highly cinematic, tastefully different and captivating enough to hold viewers attention right from start to finish. The video features familiar faces like Nkem Juma, Tare Deinne, Daberechi of Few Models and Stephanie Otiono as the female leads. It was styled by Ashley Okoli and Deto Black. Sparky was shot and directed by the Candles team in Lagos, Nigeria. watch “Sparky” via YouTube Below;
