The Commission stated that supplementary election will hold in nine polling units of Ibeju-Lekki State constituency I. According to the statement, the election in the state constituency was inconclusive as a result of over-voting in nine polling units covering two Registration Areas of the constituency. Before taking the decision of holding the supplementary election, the Commission met with all the relevant stakeholders in the area including the political parties and affected candidates, Inter-agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES) for the local government and other interested groups.
