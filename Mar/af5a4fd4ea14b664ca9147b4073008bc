Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Tuesday released the deputy director-general of the Atiku Campaign Organization Tanimu Turaki. Turaki, a former presidential aspirant of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), was reportedly arrested by operatives of the EFCC for no specific reasons, according to the PDP. Prior to his release, PDP spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, accused Nigeria president Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) of using federal powers to intimidate officials of the opposition party. Ologbodiyan alleged that the PDP’s decision to challenge Buhari’s second term victory in court prompted the Turaki’s arrest. According to him, “Since the people’s candidate, Atiku Abubakar and the PDP expressed our unwavering determination to reclaim our victory at the tribunal, being armed with overwhelming evidence, our leaders have been subjected to escalated harassments, constant threats blackmail, cajoling and contrivances by the APC to drop our legal option. “It is instructive to state that Tanimu Turaki was arrested and detained upon invitation by the EFCC to endorse a bail document for the Finance Director of Atiku Abubakar’s company, Babalele Abdullahi, who was arrested earlier by the commission over flimsy allegations,” Ologbondiyan said in a statement.
