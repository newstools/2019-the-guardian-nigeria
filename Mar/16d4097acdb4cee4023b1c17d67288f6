If you have not heard the legendary food – tuwo – then this is for you. Do you know how indigenous people of Southern Nigeria love amala and ewedu? That is exactly how people from northern Nigeria love their tuwo; and the most popular soup that accompanies it–miyan kuka soup.
The quantity of miyan kuka soup that the following quantities of ingredients will give you depends on the consistency you like for your soups. As you cook the soup, add water to bring it to the consistency you like. You might need more details on the ingredients. See below: Kuka powder is dry baobab leaves that have been ground into powder.
Miyan kuka is usually very seasoned, so add your favourite seasoning (beef flavour) and use the juiciest parts of beef. You can also use tozo (beef with marbling). The quantities and varieties of meat and fish to add to your Nigerian soup is entirely up to you. However, don’t use chicken. Goat meat, beef, and so on, go well with Nigerian soups. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-876271 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kuka-soup-ingredients-PHOTO-YouTube.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="716" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kuka-soup-ingredients-PHOTO-YouTube.jpg 697w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kuka-soup-ingredients-PHOTO-YouTube-320x179.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kuka-soup-ingredients-PHOTO-YouTube-281x158.jpg 281w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kuka-soup-ingredients-PHOTO-YouTube-487x272.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kuka-soup-ingredients-PHOTO-YouTube-640x358.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kuka-soup-ingredients-PHOTO-YouTube-600x336.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Palm oil is essential to this soup. Once you add palm oil, you will notice a delicious change in the aroma of this soup. Kuka powder is dark so you will only notice a slight change in the soup’s colour when you add palm oil.
You can use cayenne pepper (fresh or dry) instead of habanero peppers. Before you cook: Miyan Kuka is best served with tuwo shinkafa. There is also tuwo masara. But we will focus on shinkafa. <img class="size-large wp-image-876273 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Tuwo-Shinkafa-PHOTO-Instagram-1728x1152.jpeg" alt="" width="1728" height="1152" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Tuwo-Shinkafa-PHOTO-Instagram-1728x1152.jpeg 1728w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Tuwo-Shinkafa-PHOTO-Instagram-897x598.jpeg 897w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Tuwo-Shinkafa-PHOTO-Instagram-487x325.jpeg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Tuwo-Shinkafa-PHOTO-Instagram-974x649.jpeg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Tuwo-Shinkafa-PHOTO-Instagram-320x213.jpeg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Tuwo-Shinkafa-PHOTO-Instagram-640x427.jpeg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Tuwo-Shinkafa-PHOTO-Instagram-600x400.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1728px) 100vw, 1728px" />
