Professor Kayode Shoremekun Vice Chancellor, Federal University, Oye Ekiti (FUOYE), Professor Kayode Shoremekun has said the university’s postgraduate students caught plagiarising would be expelled. He, therefore, admonished them to engage in scholarly research that could benefit not only the University, but also the nation. The VC, speaking at the maiden FUOYE’s matriculation ceremony for 292 postgraduate students, attributed the dearth of research by university students, particularly at postgraduate to low-level support from the Federal Government. Shoremekun, represented by Prof. Babatope Alabadan, the Chairman, Committee of Deans and Dean, Faculty of Engineering, noted that sustainable development and meaningful growth could only be achieved through adequate and continuous research in universities. He urged government and other education stakeholders to put in more effort in research studies. He, however, charged the students to buckle up, as “the future lies on young researchers like them.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
