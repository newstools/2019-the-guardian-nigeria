The Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja today ruled that Senator Ayogu Eze remains the true governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress in Enugu State. In His ruling over the substantive suit by Eze challenging his removal by Federal High Court, the panel of judges led by Justice Aboki upheld the prayers of Senator Ayogu Eze in which he prayed that he is the duly elected candidate of the party. The appellate court ruled that “what happened at the lower court was a miscarriage of justice as Barr. Ogara has no case in the first place.” He stated that “Ogara filed after 14 days of the result being published as allowed by law, so the lower court had no jurisdiction to entertain his case.” Justice Aboki directed the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC to immediately restore the name of Senator Ayogu Eze as the candidate of the party.
