Dr Uba Sani, Senator-elect (APC – Kaduna) says he is confident that Gov. Nasiru El-Rufai would be re-elected.Sani, former Adviser to  El-Rufai on Political matters, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday in  Kaduna that he personally monitored the exercise in parts of Kaduna after casting his vote at his  polling unit in Kawo LEA Primary School, Kaduna. Sani defeated the incumbent Shehu Sani of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) in the Feb 23 Presidential and National Assembly elections to clinch the Kaduna Central senate seat. “ Every one of us is happy, optimistic and in high spirit that Gov. Nasir El-Rufai of All Progressives Congress  will come back as newly elected governor for the second term. “Yes, I can tell, the All Progressive Party (APC) will defeat the opposition party, People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Kaduna State,“ Sani said. He, however, said the seeming low turn out of voters was as result of smooth process of the exercise, where the electorate did not have to wait. “What you saw at most polling units was impressive, the whole exercise was so smooth that voters were casting their votes and leaving in good time,“ he said. Sani commended INEC for addressing most of the challenges the process faced during the Presidential and National Assembly polls in the state.He appealed to the electorate to conduct themselves peacefully after the election for faster development and growth of the state.
