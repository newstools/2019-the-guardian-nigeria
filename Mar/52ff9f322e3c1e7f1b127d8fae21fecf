She would, they claim, stay with him and his girlfriend. However, the girl claims that only a few days later, he started sending “numerous sexually explicit text messages, images, and videos” including “a Snapchat image of Massey holding his penis with a corresponding text message that reads ‘LOL/Just me messing with u LOL.'” This is asides the video of his privates. For the damage, she is asking for at least $1.5 million.
