Justice Walter Onnoghen The Supreme Court has fixed May 17 for ruling on the suit filed by Cross River State government seeking to set aside the six-count charge of non-assets declaration against the suspended Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Walter Onnoghen. The suit filed by the stateâ€™s attorney general is challenging the suspension and trial of Justice Onnoghen at the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT). The suit No. SC/45/2019 and dated January 22 has the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Attorney General of the Federation as defendants. But the Federal Government had asked the apex court to dismiss the suit, arguing that the plaintiff had no locus standi to institute it. When the matter came up for hearing yesterday, counsel for the plaintiff, Locius Nwosu (SAN), adopted his brief of argument in urging the court to grant the reliefs sought by the state. However, counsel to the defendants and the Solicitor-General of the Federation, Dayo Akpata, argued his notice of preliminary objection.
