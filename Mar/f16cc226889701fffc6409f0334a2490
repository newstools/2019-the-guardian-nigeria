One of the support groups that rallied support for President Muhammadu Buhari’s re-election, Re-elect Buhari Movement (RBM), has ended its operations after thanking Nigerians for re-electing the president. The group in a statement by its convener, Mr. Emmanuel Umohinyang, noted that it became expedient since the main objective of the group had come to a successful end. The statement reads: “Sequel to the re-sounding victory of President Buhari, the existence of RBM has officially come to a close.
 
“It is no longer feasible to keep volunteers of the movement as a functioning group, hence the need to formally dissolve same. On behalf of President Buhari, I extend a warm appreciation to every member and wish them well in their future endeavours.”
 
The movement was founded about a year ago as a volunteer support group with strong interest to work for the president’s re-election to enable the administration consolidate on its achievements in its second term.
