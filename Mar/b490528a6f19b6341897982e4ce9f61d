The Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN) has pledged to ensure Nigerians with tuberculosis (TB) are provided proper pharmaceutical care with simplified medication for compliance and total cure of the epidemic before 2030. The pharmaceutical body said it is committed to achieving a TB free world through one of its technical group, the Association of Community Pharmacists, which is poised to take up the DOT (Directly Observed Therapy) programme and ensure proper pharmaceutical care for patients of TB since chemotherapy remains the main cure. The President, Pharm Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa, commemorating the 2019 World Tuberculosis Day, with the theme “It’s time to end TB”, said if ending TB Epidemic by 2030 is one of the health targets of the sustainable development goals, “then prevention, diagnosis and early treatment with first line TB drugs should be given all the seriousness it requires.” Ohuabunwa stressed that TB incidence is falling globally at about two per cent per year, though multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR – TB) remains a public health crisis and a global health security threat.
