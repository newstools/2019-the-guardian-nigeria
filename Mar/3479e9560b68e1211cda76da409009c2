As we join the entire world in celebrating International Women’s Day and the Women’s Month in March, we cannot afford to forget the women who scored the firsts…women who blazed the trail in the different professions, paving the way for other women to make inroads therein.They are women who broke the stereotypes of women being confined to only certain professions, proving their mettle as brilliant lawyers, seasoned bankers, doctors and more, so much so that this year’s theme for IWD, is requesting a “Balance For Better” to achieve gender parity in the society by giving women more opportunities to contribute to nation- building in all spheres of life.
Here are a few of such outstanding women who have made a mark in the Nigerian society, serving as role models to younger women. We salute the First Ladies of the Professions. Engr. Ebele Ofunneamaka Okeke
