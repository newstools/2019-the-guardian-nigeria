American actor and rapper, Will Smith, 50, is to take the role of Richard Williams, the father of tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams, in the film “King Richard.” The film is based on a script by Zach Baylin, which would centre on Richard Williams overcoming hardship, scepticism, controversy, and his own troubled past to instruct his daughters on tennis courts of Compton, Calif. The movie talks about how Williams instructed his two daughters on tennis when they were four years old, despite not having a background on the game, says Variety. Baylin’s script was runner-up on the 2018 Blacklist. Serena has won 23 Grand Slam singles titles, starting with the US Open in 1999. Venus has seven Grand Slam singles, starting with Wimbledon in 2000. The sisters have combined 14 Grand Slam doubles championships. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-872887 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/richard-williams-movie-will-smith.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="563" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/richard-williams-movie-will-smith.jpg 1000w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/richard-williams-movie-will-smith-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/richard-williams-movie-will-smith-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/richard-williams-movie-will-smith-281x158.jpg 281w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/richard-williams-movie-will-smith-562x316.jpg 562w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/richard-williams-movie-will-smith-531x299.jpg 531w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/richard-williams-movie-will-smith-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/richard-williams-movie-will-smith-487x274.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/richard-williams-movie-will-smith-974x548.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/richard-williams-movie-will-smith-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /> Tim and Trevor White will produce the movie under their Star Thrower Entertainment banner, which has backed “The Post,” “Wind River,” and “Ingrid Goes West,” Smith would also produce under his Overbrook Entertainment company.
