Justin Bieber’s fans love him so much they go anywhere he goes. According to CNN Travel, the Environmental Agency of Iceland announced that Fjaðrárgljúfur, which was featured in Bieber’s “I’ll Show You” music video, will be closed to the public until June. Blaming Bieber for the tourism spike, agency official Daníel Freyr Jónsson told Icelandic news outlet RUV that not many people outside of Iceland knew about the destination prior to the music video. “This canyon was somewhat unknown,” he said. “But I think Icelanders have known about it a lot longer. The great increase in foot traffic began after Bieber came. There has been an increase of 50 percent to 80 percent between 2016, 2017 and 2018.” According to The Telegraph, 150,000 tourists visited the canyon in 2017, and the number increased to 282,000 the following year. To date, Bieber’s music video has been viewed over 440 million times.  The Environment Agency of Iceland initially planned on keeping Fjaðrárgljúfur closed for two weeks in order to allow for the paths and vegetation around the canyon a chance to improve, according to the Lonely Planet. After it became apparent the two-week closure did not have the intended effect, the decision was made to keep the canyon closed until June 1.
