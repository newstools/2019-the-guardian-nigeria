Searching for nude lipsticks for women of colour can frustrate and hard to find. Some are sometimes too light; some are too pink or some are just ashy. Thankfully, we have brands and makeup lines who are doing the work and creating inclusive lip products for different skin tones. For those who have been searching, here is a short list of those nude lip products that include bullet lipsticks, lip glosses, liquid lipsticks and more. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-881664 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mac-cosmetics-velvet-teddy--1152x1152.jpg" alt="" width="1152" height="1152" /> Every time we asked a WOC for their favourite nude lipstick, Velvet Teddy by MAC always comes up. Many love this lipstick around the world and it is one of MAC Cosmetics’ cult lipsticks. This lipstick is a nude, beige that works for all skin tones but looks amazing on dark-skinned women. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-881658 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NYX-AfterHours--1152x1152.jpeg" alt="" width="1152" height="1152" /> If you’re a darker skin tone and looking for a true brown lip product, look no further than After Hours by Nyx.

They make the Melted Latex line from Too Faced Cosmetics with an exclusive technology that keeps high-shine lipsticks liquid for longer wear. That means you have an amazing product with the staying power of a liquid lipstick with the high shine of a gloss.

Coffee Crave is a light brown lipstick with a light pink undertone which makes it great for lighter-skinned WOC. The Covergirl lipsticks promise you a rich colour infused with shea butter that saturates your lips with moisture. If you’re looking for a liquid lipstick that doesn’t dry out your lips, try out the Superstay MatteInk line from Maybelline. The shade Amazonian is a deep rich brown that works as a great nude lip. This highly pigmented liquid lipstick claims to last up to 16 hours – wow! <img class="aligncenter wp-image-881660 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mented-cosmetics-dope-taupe--e1552838939744.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1920" /> Mented Cosmetics was created by two WOC who were looking to create the perfect nude lip shades for WOC. Out of their many shades, we recommend you get Dope Taupe. It is a beautiful mix of brown and pink that will quickly become your go-to nude.
