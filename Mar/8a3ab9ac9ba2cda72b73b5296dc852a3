An ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) wife has defended the right to ‘rape’ women because the holy Quran supports it. Speaking to another woman in a camera on the rape of Yazidi women by ISIS, she claims that the Quran supports the rape and murder of the women who have become sex slaves because they are prisoners of war or as her interpretation of the Quran is “property,” Daily Mail reports. “’it’s not rape in Islam..because they are your property.” “They were prisoners of war, and they become slaves, it is in [the] Quran…If it’s in the Quran then who am I to question [it]?” Read More: #ArewaMeToo: Time To Speak Up Read More: Countering Rape Culture in Nigeria She however said that she has not read the text supporting her claim but she “did know much” about the text. “I don’t know much about the Quran,” she said laughing. Sura 24, verse 33 states, “Force not your slave-girls to whoredom that ye may seek enjoyment of the life of the world, if they would preserve their chastity.”
Yazidi had been under siege since 2014 after ISIS captured killed off their men and captured their women as sex slaves. Their women’s bodies are sometimes found beheaded and dumped in refuse places after being sexually molested.
