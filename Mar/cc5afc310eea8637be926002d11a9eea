 [FILES] Sunshine Stars.		         PHOTO: FEMI ADEBESIN-KUTI.  The encounter, a Match Day 12 of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL), is slated for the Enyimba International Stadium, Aba. However, fans of the former African champions will hope their club defeats the ‘Owena Waves’, who the ‘People’s Elephants’ played a goalless draw with in the first round game at the Akure Township Stadium. Enyimba currently occupy second position on the log of the NPFL group A with 16 points; having won four matches, lost three and drawn four out of 11 games, while the Sunshine Stars are fifth on the log with 13 points from 10 matches, having lost three, drawn four and won three of their NPFL’s fixtures. Speaking to The Guardian yesterday, Abd’Allah said everything is being put in place to ensure that the team won. According to him, he was not apprehensive that his team has still not hit the form expected of them. “We are trying all our best to make sure we win in tomorrow’s (today) encounter against the Sunshine Stars. Though it is not going to be an easy game, we hope to triumph at the end of the day and pick all three points at stake. “Winning four games out of 11  shouldn’t cause any alarm. It is also interesting to note that we also picked valuable points away from home, which shows the character of the team,” he said, while appealing to fans to come out and watch Enyimba beat Sunshine Stars in today’s match that promises to be an interesting encounter.
