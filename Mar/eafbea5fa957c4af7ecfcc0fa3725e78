Grammy award-winning rapper, Cardi B has never hidden the fact that she is no saint but things went a bit far for many after an old video of her surfaced on the internet. In the old clip, the mother of one admitted to using sex to drug men and rob them of their money. The hip-hop sensation disclosed this as she talked about what her life was like in the past. In the video she says: “You gotta go to a good school yo and you gotta put in that bread. I did it with my money, so for a b*tch to say that I don’t motherf*cking deserve it cause I don’t put in no f*cking work, now that’s when I feel like n*ggas is buggin’. Cause I did it myself. N*ggas must’ve forgot my n*gga, the sh*t that I did to motherf*cking survive like I had to go strip. I had to go ‘oh yea, you wanna f*ck me? Yea, yea, yea, let’s go to this hotel.’ And I drugged n*ggas up and I robbed them. That’s what I used to do. Nothing was motherf*cking handed to me my n*gga! Nothing! So for a b*tch to motherf*cking say that I don’t deserve sh*t that’s when I know that they’re f*cking buggin’ cause they do not f*cking know the sh*t that I had to do.” The video is surfacing in the midst of Cardi B currently suing two bloggers for defamation after saying she had sex for money and has herpes. Following the video going viral, many began to call on her past victims to come forward so that the former stripper turned rapper can be sent to jail.
