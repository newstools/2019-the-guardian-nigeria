 [FILES] Drone  The world’s military powers will significantly reduce the sizes of their military in favor of robots and drones. Thanks to advanced robotic and drone technologies this is not too far off. Military strategists may want to keep an eye on China and the U.S., who are exponentially far in the lead when it comes to drone technology. Of particular interest will be the devastating power of swarm drones in modern warfare. Korea expects to have completed all highway construction within the next five to seven years. The country is already mapping the use of vertical infrastructure (vertical space) for the utilization of drone based vehicles.  Retail giant, #Amazon, is already looking into the feasibility of drone-based deliveries. Expected roll out date of Drone cabs? 2025 according to industry estimates. For now, it cannot be business as usual. The ground underneath our feet has shifted in favor of the skies. For now, countries must rapidly-develop new aviation policies and legislation that takes vertical transportation and drones into consideration; map their respective vertical spaces and define limitations and boundaries for civilian, commercial, industrial, military and high altitude drones;  begin to anticipate a future where the physical infrastructure of roads, highways, and bridges, will soon compete for expenditure with the development of A.I., massive cloud data mining, and autonomous aerial transportation. Already, solar powered High Altitude Long Endurance (HALEs) – pseudo satellite drones capable of remaining in the skies for an entire year – are strong indicators of near future military, commercial, and transportation trends.  The battle of the skies is frenetically underway.
