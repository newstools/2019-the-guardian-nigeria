In the wake of the controversy that the HBO documentary, “Leaving Neverland” has stirred, the Children’s Museum of Indianapolis has reportedly removed three Michael Jackson items from exhibits. We reported earlier that the documentary features lengthy testimony from Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who allege that the late king of pop sexually abused them as children. It is now gathered that in light of the allegations, a fedora and glove Jackson wore onstage and a Jackson poster are no longer on display at the museum. The museum’s director of collections, Chris Carron says it wants items on display to tell stories of “people of high character.” A statement from the museum reads: “Three Michael Jackson artifacts have been removed from two exhibits at The Children’s Museum of Indianapolis: his iconic fedora and white glove that we purchased several years ago at auction for our American Pop exhibit, and the signed Michael Jackson poster that was in The Power of Children exhibit.” “As the world’s largest children’s museum, we are more sensitive than most to our audience. In an excess of caution, and in response to the controversy over the HBO film called Leaving Neverland, which directly involved allegations of abuse against children, we removed those objects while we carefully consider the situation more fully.” “The museum’s nationally-recognised The Power of Children exhibit directly addresses issues of discrimination and intolerance of all kinds. Michael Jackson pictures on display in The Power of Children exhibit remain because they are part of a direct re-creation of Ryan White’s room,” the statement continues. “Ryan’s family found Michael Jackson’s kindness to them to be an important part of Ryan’s story and the pictures of Michael displayed in that exhibit will always be an integral part of the Ryan White story. The poster was removed because it was not part of the original re-creation of Ryan’s room.”
