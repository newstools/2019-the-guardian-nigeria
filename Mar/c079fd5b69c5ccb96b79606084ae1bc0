What would you do if you found a bag full of money? That’s the question many Nigerians are trying to find an answer to, thanks to this trending story. A video went viral today; a cleaner at Murtala Mohammed International Airport, MMIA, Josephine Ugwu claimed she had returned different amounts of money running into millions. Sometimes, 12, sometimes 8 million Naira, she said in the video. Ugwu, however, is not happy because she feels she has not gotten the recognition she deserves. Her stance is if Nigeria were another country she would have been an ambassador of honesty to the youths. She’s truly sound. She’s not asking for award or recognition. She truly is a perfect candidate for TEDTalk on Honesty and Integrity. — Lanre Adeola (@Lanredeola) March 5, 2019  “In other countries, I would’ve been an ambassador talking to the youths about the importance of honesty. But today, nobody remembers me,” Ugwu, who was visibly distraught, said in the video. Since the video broke out online, people have divided opinions about the issue. Some say she has done well by returning the money. They even offered to send her some money as encouragement to continue her good deeds. Read some reactions below: Why should we do good because we want people to recognize us and Pat us on the back,is it still "good"? We should do the right thing and never expect thanks,if it comes fine,but if it doesn't come, you keep doing good. — Cutestellz (@cutestellz) March 5, 2019  Anty she said 4 times without been tempted do you think it’s easy to return million of money in Nigeria of today ?
