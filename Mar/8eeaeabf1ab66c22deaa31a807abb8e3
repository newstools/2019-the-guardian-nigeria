A former member of the House of Representatives, Dave Oladapo Salako, who represented Remo Federal Constituency of Ogun state twice at the House of Representatives on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP), has left the party. Salako who premised his decision to walk away from the PDP on the alleged injustices meted to him during the Ogun East Senatorial District primary election said despite the position of the Appeal Committee that he should be declared winner of the primary election; the party ignored same and instead, declared his co-contestant, Bola Kalejaiye, the party’s flag bearer. In a letter of resignation addressed to PDP national chairman, Uche Secondus, Salako accused the PDP Ogun governorship candidate in t March 9 elections, Ladi Adebutu of wielding “great influence and inducements on some of the National Executive members,” a development he argued, culminated in his denial of the Senatorial ticket by the state chapter of the party. In his letter, Salako wrote: “My first shock was the demand by the committee in charge of the primary election for the sum of N750, 000 as my share for the cost of the venue and logistics. By tradition, it has always been the responsibility of PDP to bear the cost of venue and other incidental expenses relating to primary election.” Amidst other electoral irregularities that allegedly characterised the exercise, Salako also accused officials of skipping the accreditation of voters; stressing that INEC staff and DSS “were conspicuously absent.” While noting that his request for the nullification of the exercise fell on deaf ears, Salako said he was left with no option but the quit the party he spent his resources and time to build.
