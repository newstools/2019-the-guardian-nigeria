AS Roma announced the launch of a new official Pidgin English Twitter account in a bid to connect with fans in Nigeria and neighbouring countries in Africa. The club said in a statement that the new account which is being run out of Lagos, was set up after fans in Nigeria contacted the club to request an account to cater specifically for Naija Twitter. The Serie A club has grown increasingly popular among Nigerians on social media after the club featured Lagos radio personality Mark Otabor’s epic commentary of Roma’s comeback against Barcelona on the club’s English Twitter account. Roma during the 2018 World Cup in Russia, supported Nigeria’s Super Eagles. The Italian club also worked with the Nigerian FA on social strategy and the graphics for social media during the World Cup. “After Italy failed to qualify for the World Cup and we chose to support the Super Eagles, followers in Nigeria have been asking for a Pidgin English Roma account,” revealed Paul Rogers, Head of Strategy at AS Roma. “The club’s president Jim Pallotta watched Mark Otabor’s commentary after the Barcelona game and then personally wrote to Mark to thank him and from that moment we’ve enjoyed a really fun relationship with our followers in Nigeria, who seem to enjoy our English Twitter account’s sense of humour. The launch of this new account means that we can now directly engage with these fans on a daily basis in a style that suits them.” With the @ASRomaPidgin Twitter account, Roma have become the first major European football club to have an account communicate exclusively in Pidgin English.
