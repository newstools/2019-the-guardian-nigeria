Former love birds, Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna are on speaking terms once again after a long period of feuding. The duo who were formerly engaged and share a daughter, Dream are actively communicating and repairing their relationship for the sake of their daughter. It is gathered the reality TV stars now have a good relationship so much so that they even wrote about each other on Twitter. Sources close to the former couple say they underwent at least seven mediation sessions together to iron out a deal for custody of Dream, and they have continued to be in direct contact about their daughter’s care. Taking to Twitter to write about his relationship with his baby mama, Rob Kardashian wrote, “Angela and I are both actively co-parenting and there are no pending or active custody cases.” On her part, Chyna wrote, “Robert and I only concern is what’s in the best interest of our daughter that we both equally love. Additionally, Robert is a wonderful father to out Dreamy!” As for the physical custody of Dream, Rob will have her for the majority, but they will be splitting holidays equally and finding ways to accommodate both parents’ schedules. It is learnt that they came to an understanding, during meditation, that neither would bring a new significant other around Dream unless it was a long term, healthy relationship. It would be recalled that just recently, Chyna called out Rob and her other baby daddy, Tyga for not giving enough child support.
