Sean “Diddy” Combs is obviously still mourning the love of his life. Following the sudden death of his ex-girlfriend Kim Porter last fall, the music mogul, 49, revealed on Monday his regret over not marrying the mother of four of his children. Combs shared and captioned an old photo of himself cuddling with Porter, “SMH” (meaning “shaking my head”) with a broken heart emoji, on Instagram.
