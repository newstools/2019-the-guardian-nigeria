Johnny Depp’s ex, Amber Heard has a rather interesting story to tell about acceptance and sexuality. The Aquaman actress, 32, who spoke at the Making Change On and Off the Screen panel at SXSW Saturday,said that her religious parents first reaction was disbelief. “I am from Austin, Texas. My dad is out of central casting Texan. Good Southern man, and I was raised in a religious home,” she said. “And being an outspoken lesbian, atheist, vegetarian, I remember when I told them about my relationship, that I was in love with this woman, and at the beginning of that it was just tears, tears.” “They didn’t know how to process it because, for them, it was being thrown into a binary system of processing it, negative or positive.” “Five years later, I was getting an award, and I asked my parents to drive out to Dallas,” she explained. “And I see them sitting front and center and here I am getting this ‘gay’ award… My parents in five years, look at the journey. Attitudes and hearts can change.” Amber who has been involved with Elon Musk dated her ex-girlfriend, Tasya van Ree for four years before they slipt. She, however, noted that it affected her career. “It did impact my career, it was difficult. It was not easy,” she said at The Economist’s Pride & Prejudice Summit in 2017. “I was the only one working in this way, so it was definitely difficult because no one had done it. I did that even though everyone told me it would end my career, without a doubt.” Her ex, Johnny Depp has asked her to pay the sun of $50 million for claiming domeestic violence in the marriage.
