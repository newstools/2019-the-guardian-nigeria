Wendy Williams is officially back to her TV show, “The Wendy Williams Show” and she came with hot topics! Williams who has been off her hit daytime talk show after a 6-week hiatus due to ill-health kicked off the show with revelations about how sick she really was. Sporting a refreshed look with her glowing skin and chic new bob was clearly happy to be back. According to the 54-year-old who returned to her set in New York today, March 4, she revealed that her thyroid issues were to blame for the lengthy hiatus. She said, “It can really screw you over,” she told the audience. Wendy went on to say that she had to undergo a series of MRIs and CAT Scans, but praised her doctors for bringing her to a healthy place. “I’m doing swell!” Williams also admitted she had been in need of a little break. “I just wanted to take some time for myself.” It would be recalled that Williams was diagnosed with Graves disease last year after she fainted during a live televised show on October 31. The host also suffered a fractured shoulder before she took a health-advised hiatus, announced on January 18, following the show’s holiday break, however, despite being out of the talk show game for over one month, Williams stepped back onto the stage and sat in her purple chair like she had never left.
