Oyo State Police Command has arrested the chief whip of Oyo State House of Assembly Wasiu Akinmoyede over the death of House of Representatives member Temitope Olatoye, known as ‘Sugar’ during Saturday, March 23 governorship election in the state. Akinmoyede, who represents Lagelu constituency in the assembly, was alleged to have had a hand in the murder of Olatoye, who was the senatorial candidate of Action Democratic Party (ADP). State Police Command sent a notice of Akinmoyede’s arrest to the State Assembly that it has arrested Akinmoyede in connection with the killing of Olatoye. His arrest has brought the number of those arrested in connection with the killing to two. Speaker of the House of Assembly, Olagunju Ojo, in an interview with journalists confirmed that the House was notified through a letter that Akinmoyede is under investigation. “Yes, we received a letter that he is under investigation, I am not aware that he is been taken to Abuja or not,” Ojo said. Ojo said, “I am not aware that he has been taken to Abuja. I am only aware that he is under investigations but I am not sure if he is in Abuja or not.” The Oyo State lawmaker and Olatoye have been political rivals in Lagelu local government area of the state over the years. Olatoye represented the Lagelu constituency in the House of Assembly from 2011-2015 on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). He was elected House of Representatives member for Lagelu/Akinyele federal constituency in 2015. He contested the party’s senatorial ticket but lost to the former Senate leader, Teslim Folarin and thereafter defected to ADP to achieve his senatorial ambition.
