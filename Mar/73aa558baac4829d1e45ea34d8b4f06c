Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola A former Lagos State governor, Babatunde Fashola, Thursday said the residents of the state have just two choices to pick from during the Saturday governorship election. “The choice on Saturday will be for the people to decide between their protectors and their aggressors, for me, I will choose my protector,” Fashola said during TVC’s This Morning show. The former governor was in the company of the ruling All Progressives Congress Lagos state governorship candidate, Babajide Sanwo-Olu and his running mate, Obafemi Hamzat. There are about 45 governorship candidates vying for governorship position in the state. The governorship and states assemblies polls are scheduled to hold on Saturday, March 9. Governorship election will hold in 29 states. According to Fashola, Sanwo-Olu and his deputy are not strangers to the challenges the state faces. “Sanwo-Olu and Hamzat are familiar with Lagos and with the people,” he said. There are 6,570,291 registered voters with only 5,531,389 persons with PVCs. About 1, 038,909 PVCs remain uncollected. However, in the presidential election held about eleven days ago, Lagos State led the states with the lowest voters turnout with 17.25 per cent (1,089,567). While some observers believed that the low turnout was as a result of the one week postponement of the 2019 polls by INEC, some others opined that cases of violence in some areas in Lagos in build-up to and during the elections, may have hindered voters from exercising their franchise.
