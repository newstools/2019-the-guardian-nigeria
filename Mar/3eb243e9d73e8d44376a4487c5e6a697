Empire star Jussie Smollett, who was accused by Chicago police of staging a hate crime against himself in January, pleaded not guilty on Thursday after he was indicted on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct by a grand jury. Smollett was initially charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct, stemming from accusations that he falsified a police report and lied to authorities about the events that took place on January 29th 2019. He pleaded not guilty to the first felony charge from February 20th, however, a grand jury then indicted the Empire star for more than a dozen felony counts to the tune of 16 charges on March 8th. The trial is still ongoing and his lawyer Tina Glandian entered the plea on Smollettâ€™s behalf.
