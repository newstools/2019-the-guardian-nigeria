Former People’s Democratic Party’s social media strategist and leading Our Mumu Don Do campaigner Deji Adeyanju Wednesday said he has resigned from the group. Adeyanju said he resigned because he was no longer confident in the leadership of the organisation and accused Charles Oputa, popularly known as Charly Boy of betraying the aims of the movement. “I have resigned my membership of  Our Mumu Don,” Adeyanju tweeted on Wednesday morning. “I no longer have confidence in the leader of the movement, Charly Boy. He betrayed the cause while I was away in prison and compromised with the oppressors.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
