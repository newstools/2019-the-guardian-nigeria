For his contribution to the music industry not just in Nigeria and Africa but the world at large, Afro-pop superstar, Innocent Ujah Idibia well known by the stage name 2Face Idibia or 2Baba has been honoured with the award of Fellow of the School of Music by the Department of Music, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife.
  
At the event, which held on Wednesday, March 20, at the University, the music legend was also a guest lecturer at the department’s first public lecture and fellowship award, where he delivered a paper titled: Two Decades of Afro-pop in Nigeria: The Perspective of 2Baba.
   
With the honour, 2Baba as he is fondly called, who has stayed relevant in the Afro-pop scene for two decades, becomes the pioneer recipient of the award, which was presented to him at the department’s first public lecture and fellowship award.Speaking shortly after receiving the award, the African Queen crooners said, “Being the torch-bearer for the new pop movement is a role I do not take lightly, and I am honoured to have been found worthy of such noble albeit enormous responsibility.”  In 2008, he released a promotion album titled The Unstoppable, which had the club banger Enter the Place. Due to challenges of distribution in 2007, there was a shift in release date from 2008 to early 2009. He followed up in 2010, with the released of an international version of the album, retaining the title with a little modification: The Unstoppable International Edition, making him the first Nigerian artiste to have an appropriately priced international album.
  
With two more singles released from the international version, 2face won two awards at the 2010 SoundCity Music Video Awards, and the Channel O Music Video Awards for Best African (Western) and the MTV Africa Music Awards for Best Male and Artiste of the year.He is part of the Sony All African One8 Project alongside seven other musicians across Africa recording a single with R. Kelly and Prince Lee titled ‘Hands Across the World’.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
