While speaking at a recent event it organised in Lagos, CYM Ward G2 president, Lewis Mose, said Elliot performed satisfactorily in his first term beyond expectations. Mose insisted that the laudable works undertaken by the lawmaker had not only spoken for him, but also caused CYM and the youths in the constituency to support his second term bid to put more smiles on their faces. His words: “The average youth in Surulere wants him to go for a second time, not just because of politics but because of what he has done. He has affected not just the youths but also the entire constituency at a whole. “We are impressed by what he has done and together we are going to rally around him and make him come back for a second term because we are optimistic that he would do more than he has done already. “Desmond has done a lot for Surulere and we want him to continue the good work by endorsing him. He has built nothing less than six ultra modern classroom blocks which were completely furnished at Itolo Secondary School.” Mose recalled that the lawmaker awarded scholarships to 17 students from the constituency of which about 11 of them would be graduating this year. He added that Elliot also organised skill acquisition and empowerment programmes in which over 350 persons benefited. “He has sponsored 20 of our youths in the constituency abroad to study, bought jamb forms for over 300 students and facilitated the rehabilitation and construction of over 11 roads in the constituency and we are satisfied with that,” he added. In his remarks, Hon. Elliot thanked the group for its support and endorsement, assuring them that his sole priority was to make Surulere greater than it was, especially by citing more technology-driven projects in the constituency. He said: “The bio toilets that were cited in the constituency is a welcome development because it is technologically driven. As people use the toilets, their wastes are turned into manure which can be used to support agriculture, which would help in growing the state’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
