• Insists Lulu-Briggs Validly Nominated By Party
• To Appeal Court Judgement
Accord Party (AP) has rejected the candidature of Precious Baridoo as its gubernatorial candidate for the March 9 governorship election in Rivers State, insisting that Dumo Lulu-Briggs remains its validly nominated candidate for the polls. It also said that the party is going to appeal the Federal High Court judgment that sacked Lulu-Briggs as its gubernatorial candidate.
Recall that a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt, Rivers State had on Thursday ruled that Dumo Lulu-Briggs was not the duly nominated gubernatorial candidate of Accord Party (AP) in the state. The court, had therefore, ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to enlist Precious Baridoo as the state’s Accord Party authentic governorship candidate.National Chairman of the party, Hon. Muhammad Lawal Nalado, briefing journalists on Friday in Abuja, said the party never at any time submitted Baridoo as its candidate to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), adding that Baridoo never participated in the process of electing the party’s flag bearer and he did not pay for expression of interest as stipulated by the party that he wants to be governor. Nalado added that Dumo Lulu-Briggs’s name was duly submitted by the party to INEC after the withdrawal of Amieye Nelson who won the party’s primaries conducted on October 4, 2018. He denied that the party had endorsed the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Rivers State, Nyesom Wike in the coming gubernatorial election, adding that the Rivers State Interim Executive under Mr. Precious Baridoo had been dissolved and a Caretaker Executive Committee was constituted under the Chairmanship of Dr. Nnana Onyekwere. He said: “Without any fear of contradiction, we want to debunk this claim by Mr. Precious Baridoo, and state categorically that; Mr. Precious Baridoo was never an aspirant in our party at any time, so the party does know about his candidature at all. “Precious Baridoo did not pay for expression of interest as stipulated by the party, neither participated in any process of electing our party’s flag bearer for the March 9, 2019 gubernatorial election in Rivers State. “The party never at any time submitted his name or particulars to Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as our candidate. The party dully submitted the name of Chief Dumo Lulu-Briggs as its candidate after the withdrawal of Amieye Nelson who won the Party’s Primaries conducted on the 4th of October 2018.” He continued: “We affirm that Chief Dumo Lulu-Briggs remains our validly nominated candidate. Mr. Precious Baridoo is an impostor working in collusion with PDP and its gubernatorial candidate because they are afraid of our popularity in Rivers.”He therefore, urged members and the general public in Rivers State to go out en-masse and vote for Chief (Barr) Dumo Luiu-Briggs on the 9th of March 2019 as the only recognized candidate of the party.
