The News Agency of Nigeria, (NAN)  reports that Omosilade, who was Fayose’s personal assistant, had in a letter to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), signified his intention to withdraw from the race. He cited a lack of confidence in the neutrality of INEC to conduct free and fair election. His withdrawal was rejected by INEC, saying he remains the candidate of the PDP for the constituency. INEC said he should have withdrawn from the race at least, 45 days before the poll, as allowed by the Electoral Act.
