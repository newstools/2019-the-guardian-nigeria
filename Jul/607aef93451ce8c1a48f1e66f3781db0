Zenith Bank had urged the team to go for the win before the game but said the players showed a lot of resilience in the match by coming from a goal down to get the equaliser and almost taking the game to extra time. Speaking on the competition, the Group Managing Director of the bank, Ebenezer Onyeagwu commended the fighting spirit of the Eagles, adding that they have displayed the quality of champions, despite the defeat. “Although we wanted them to come back with the trophy, getting to the last four is a good achievement for the team,” he said. “With host country, Egypt, defending champions, Cameroun and some other top teams failing to get to the last four, I will say they have made Nigeria proud. “It was not an easy task against a team like Algeria, who have been playing exceptionally well since the start of the competition, but taking the battle to them, especially in the second half, show that we have a bright future in the team.” Onyeagwu, however, tasked them not to return to the country empty-handed, adding they should go all out for a win against Tunisia in the third-place match. He said the boys should put behind them the semifinal loss against Algeria and make Tunisia pay for the defeat.
