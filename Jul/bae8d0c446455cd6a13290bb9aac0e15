Meanwhile, Titi Tade, a clinical psychologist and Deputy Director, Medical Social Services at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), has said more women than men in Nigeria attempt suicide. She stated this while delivering a lecture titled, ‘Depression, vis-à-vis Suicide Rate in the Country, at the July congress of the Nigeria Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ), Lagos State chapter. Tade also noted that this was so because women were more prone to depression than men. She said depressed women were more likely to seek help than their male counterparts. “More women attempt suicide than men and more women survive suicide attempt than men because the method they adopt or substances they take for suicide are usually milder than that of the men. Out of five women that attempt suicide, four have the tendency to survive, while only one out of five men that attempt such survive,” she said. According to the psychologist, over 90 per cent of suicide cases are caused by depression. Tade said 78 percent of suicide cases globally occur in the underdeveloped countries while the developed countries record only 22 percent.
