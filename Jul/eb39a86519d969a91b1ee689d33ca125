The Senate will screen Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad for confirmation as the substantive Chief Justice of Nigeria on Wednesday. Justice Tanko Muhammad has been serving as acting CJN since January 25 this year when the then Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Walter Onnoghen, was suspended from office on grounds of alleged corrupt practices. President Muhammadu Buhari had last week Thursday forwarded to the Senate a letter seeking confirmation of Tanko Muhammad as substantive Chief Justice of Nigeria. The President in the letter said the nomination was sequel to the recommendation made to that effect by the National Judicial Council. “In accordance with Section 231 (1) of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), which gives the president the power to appoint a Chief Justice of Nigeria on the recommendation of the National Judicial Council and subject to the confirmation of the appointment by the Senate,” Buhari said in the letter. “I have the honour to forward the nomination of Honourable Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammed for confirmation as Chief Justice of Nigeria.” “It is my hope that this request will receive the usual expeditious consideration of the distinguished Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria” The Senate listed it on its order paper Tuesday and resolved to carry out the screening on Wednesday. President of the Senate Ahmad Lawan said that all the relevant credentials of the acting CJN, have been distributed to all the Senators for required perusal. The screening exercise would be done by the Committee of the Whole because the upper legislative chamber was yet to constitute its standing committees. Lawan urged his colleagues to study the qualification papers of the Acting CJN which had already been circulated.
