Retrosoft Solutions Limited, one of the fastest growing and leading digital marketing agencies in Lagos, has launched a new product,  Ruby, which serves the needs of brands looking to generate leads.
 
The new product enables the small and medium enterprises (SMEs), sales teams and corporate brands deploy smarter digital advertisements using multiple ads platforms and DSPs thereby extending its audience reach to over 20 million local Internet users and 100+ million users globally. Speaking at the product launch in Lagos, the Chief Executive Officer of Retrosoft, Collins Oforgu, said while taking a critical look into the marketing industry, the company noticed a deficit in quality digital marketing solutions for SMEs and sales teams, as most marketing agencies prefer working with big brands that can afford to pay a lot more. He said: “Ruby, which was specifically designed to cater to this niche market, eliminates the act of sporadic spending on marketing activities that don’t necessarily generate results, so we decided to create a solution that primarily focuses on generating leads for businesses.
 
“Ruby is especially unique because it combines a perfect blend of all essential requirements for SMEs to run successful marketing campaigns in one package. These include websites and landing page design, display ads designs, videos ads creation, Native ads content and a budget as marketing spend.”
 
Collins revealed that the company deployed Ruby for 20 pilot businesses from the real estate, finance, health, and travel industries, and the outcome showed a phenomenal increase in leads generated compared to the use of the conventional online marketing trio comprising Facebook, Instagram, and Google ads. “Unarguably the best feature of Ruby is the ability to build your plan. Ruby is the only programmatic ad solution that is designed to adapt to any marketing budget. Ruby allows businesses to simply decide and pay for only what they deem as necessary through its build your plan feature. “Based on industry experience, audience intent, and client’s need, Ruby also allows each client to define every criterion of their target audience, their preferred audience based on geography, demography and psychography, the ideal channels for deployment, the devices, operating system, and retargeting criteria. “The firm also offers monthly discount bundles that allow businesses to save even more money on marketing and offers full transparency in monitoring Ads placement, performances, and reports.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
