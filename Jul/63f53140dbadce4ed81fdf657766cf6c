Originally scheduled for November, the vote was brought forward following Essebsi’s death on July 25. Potential nominees must submit their candidacy between August 2 and August 9. The campaigns are scheduled to run from September 2 to September 13, with the results announced two days after the polls. A date for the second round of presidential elections has not yet been decided, but Baffoun said it would be held no later than November 3. The announcement came just hours after the body met with representatives of political parties and civil society, some of whom demanded it postpones the first round of elections to run with parliamentary polls set for October 6.
