With the decline in forest resources, the Federal Government has put in place measures that would ensure forest reserves are managed sustainably. Speaking at the Extra-Ordinary Session of National Forestry Development Committee (NFDC), in Lafia, Nasarawa state,  Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Environment, Ibukun Odusote, stated that Nigeria has joined the global initiatives for sustainability. She said it has become imperative to position the industry appropriately as an important sector in the economy, especially through revenue-generating capacity and environmental stabilization.
 
According to her, three major effects of the decline are manifesting and reaching levels that threaten our survival as a country and these are insecurity, resource use conflict, and climate change. She, therefore, called on states, as custodians of the nation’s forest estates to develop appropriate strategies consistent with international best practices in sustainable forest management plans.
