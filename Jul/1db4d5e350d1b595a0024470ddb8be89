Less than three years after taking the reins of office from former Prime Minister, David Cameron, Theresa May will bow out on Tuesday, when the result of the Conservative Party two-horse race leadership election between front runner, Boris Johnson and Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt is announced. May tearfully announced her resignation on May 24, having failed thrice to get parliament backing for her Brexit plans.She took the last Prime Minister’s Question Time at the House of Commons on Wednesday, fielding various questions from Members of Parliament (MPs), including attacking the main opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, of tolerating anti-Semitism views in the Labour Party. Meanwhile, Brexit, which has been the Achilles heel of both the outgoing PM and her predecessor, still poses a big problem for whoever takes over on Wednesday, as MPs are still divided on the proposal tabled by Johnson and Hunt. While Johnson is determined to go as far as taking the route of a No Deal for the country to be out of the European Union on October 31, those opposed to that plan include the chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond.
