Elisha Abbo Tuesday appeared before a Senate committee set up to investigate his actions in viral footage where he assaulted a woman in a sex toy shop in Abuja. Oluremi Tinubu, a member of the committee, asked Abbo to swear an oath before saying anything. But he bluntly refused; saying the case was in court. “This matter is in court. I cannot be talking in front of cameras when the matter is already in court. That’s subjudice,” Abbo said. “Distinguished. You just joined us. We have a procedure and we are also under law. You don’t come in here and dictate to us what should be done,” Mrs Tinubu told the opposition senator. “You are on the other side now. You don’t tell us what to do…because we can suspend you,” she added. An angry Abbo interjected “I will not sit here and listen to you threaten me with suspension. I am a senator like you. You cannot threaten me with suspension.” While the argument continued between the embattled Senator and members of the committees, journalists were asked to leave for the meeting to continue behind closed doors. Prior to this, the senator was arraigned by the Nigeria Police Force at a Magistrate Court in Adamawa State. He pleaded not guilty of the offence which he had earlier acknowledged and sought forgiveness in a press statement. The court adjourned the case and granted him bail of N5 million.
