 [FILES] NFF President, Amaju Pinnick.  Meanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari has assured the Super Eagles that he would host them at the end of the AFCON.
 
Senate president, Ahmed Lawal led an 11-man delegation to Cairo on Sunday to cheer the Super Eagles against the Algerians. They arrived in Cairo a few hours to the kick-off of the match.
 
The Guardian learned that at the end of the tie, which saw the Eagles losing 1-2 to the Desert Foxes, Lawal met with the players and their officials inside the dressing room, where he assured them of President Buhari’s continuous support for the team.
 
Lawal told the players to forget the defeat to Algeria and focus on the third-place match against Tunisia tomorrow.
 
The Senate president also told the players that the Presidency would host them, no matter the outcome of the bronze medal match against Tunisia.
 
Meanwhile, some Nigerian fans have tagged the 11-man Presidential delegation as the ‘bad luck’ to the Super Eagles. Before the delegation left Nigeria for Cairo, former Sports Minister, Solomon Dalung issued a statement saying that they were bringing good luck to the team in the semifinal against Algeria. “Where is the good luck Dalung promised? one member of the Nigerian supporters club asked. The government of Algeria provided eight planes to convey thousands of fans to Cairo to cheer their team, and they got the result. Our government only wasted money flying top party members to the match venue. Of what significance is their coming to Egypt?” he fumed.
