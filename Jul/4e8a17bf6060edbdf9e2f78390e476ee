The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) yesterday described President Muhammadu Buhari’s policy on education as wicked, criminal and against the aspirations of Nigerian youths. It accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) government of a deliberate plan to starve public education of funds in order to deny Nigerian youths the right to acquire knowledge and challenge maladministration. In a statement issued in Ibadan by the Chairman, University of Ibadan (UI) Chapter of ASUU, Professor Deji Omole, the Union lamented that the sacrifices of understaffed and underpaid Nigerian academics would be futile if President Buhari does not increase funding for the nation’s education sector. Omole, who stated that the institution was presently groaning under paucity of funds, insufficient staff, decayed infrastructure and bad laboratories, insisted that the Buhari administration was not keen on prioritising education. Omole claimed that due to paucity of funds, over 500,000 Nigerian children who desire public university education were rejected yearly due to poor funding, decayed infrastructure and reduced manpower.
