The Supreme Court Tuesday sacked a member of the House of Representatives Mustapha Usman, who represents Yola South/Yola North/Girei Federal Constituency of Adamawa State. The court ruled that Usman, a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), forged his academic credentials. The court also said Usman did not participate in the one-year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) scheme. The petition against Usman’s election was filed by Abdulra’uf Abdulkadir Modibo, a member of the APC. The court also said Modibo, who was second at the APC primary, did not participate in the election. The five-man panel led by the judge Justice John Okoro, therefore, ruled that the APC should produce the runner-up of the primary election that meets the constitutional requirements. Okoro also asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to issue the aspirant the certificate of return in place of Usman.
