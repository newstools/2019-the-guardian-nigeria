Nigerian actress, Damilola Adegbite who was formerly married to Ghanaian actor, Chris Attoh has opened up in an interview with BBC Pidgin that she is not ready to remarry. The mother of one stated that issues regarding marriage and her relationships should rather be left for her to manage. On whether she reached out to Attoh whom she shares her son with, when his new wife, Bettie Jenifer was murdered recently, she responded saying, “Why not? He’s my son’s father, so I just had to. I don’t have a choice. I believe that whatever happened between us was destined to be. On this particular issue, someone’s life was involved, so, it’s very sensitive.” On relationships and marriage, she said, “These people won’t let me rest. I was advised to settle down, I tired it and it didn’t work out. I had thought that after my failed marriage, people would let me be. But I goofed. They are still on this marriage case. Everyone should learn to mind their business, there are other things going on around the world at the moment. Let that love wait (laughs). Life at 34, it is so sweet. As I get older, I’m becoming fresher and aging backwards. I pity anybody that wants to pay my dowry and marry me now. You would have to sweat it out. But surely enjoy it all.” Watch the video below:  It would be recalled that Adegbite and Attoh met on the set of MNET television series, “Tinsel”. In August 2014, they got engaged and the duo married at a private ceremony in Ghana on February 14, 2015 but news that the marriage had crashed spread in September of 2017 . Adegbite had sparked split rumours after she deleted Attoh’s surname from her social media accounts. She also unfollowed him on Instagram, deleted all photos of him from her social media account. Hours later, in an interview, Attoh confirmed his marriage to Damilola Adegbite was over.
