Jaden Smith gifted his fans a power-packed album titled ERYS on Friday, July 5. The 17-track album features Tyler, the Creator, Kid Cudi, A$AP Rocky, Willow, Syre and Trinidad James. ERYS which is Smith’s second full-length and the follow-up to 2017’s SYRE, is a combination of hardcore punk-like rock and ethereal production. Speaking recently on Zane Lowe’s World Record on Apple Music’s Beats 1, Smith said the new album definitely has two distinct personalities. “It’s kind of like the angel and devil on my shoulder, and Syre’s the angel,” he said, referring to the feature on “Again.” “That was me telling the world, ‘Yo, this album’s gonna be something you haven’t seen from me.'” Listen to ERYS below:
