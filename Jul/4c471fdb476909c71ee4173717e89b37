Adesola Amosu Former Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Adesola Amosu (rtd.) and two others, yesterday told Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke of the Federal High Court, Ikoyi, that they were ready for a plea bargain with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). They are facing prosecution for an alleged N21 billion fraud. Amosu, the first defendant is standing trial alongside Air Vice Marshall Jacobs Adigun, a former Chief of Accounts/Budget and Air Commodore Gbadebo Owodunni, former Director of Finance and Budget in the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Adigun and Owodunni, who are second and third defendants on an amended 13-count charge bordering on conspiracy and conversion of NAF’s N21 billion to personal use pleaded not guilty to the charges. But at today’s sitting, prosecution counsel, Rotimi Oyedepo, told the court that the defendants, through their lawyers, wrote the EFCC, expressing their willingness to enter into a plea bargain over the alleged crime. Oyedepo, however, expressed concern that they have not shown commitment towards the plea bargain they requested and the general resolution of the matter. “After receiving their letter indicating their willingness to enter into a plea bargain, I made several phone calls to the defence team, as I the EFCC directed, urging them to come to the commission’s office for a meeting, but they have not shown up. “So, it appears that the defence and their clients are not committed towards to resolution of the matter,” Oyedepo informed the court. He further stated that if the defence team fails to come for the meeting before the next adjourned date, the prosecution would have no choice than to continue with the trial.
