Award-winning Nollywood actress, Funke Akindele fondly referred to as Jenifa by her fans has stated that her friends have no business calling her husband except on his birthday or they need to reach her through him. The mother of two who is married to Abdul Rasheed Bello better known as JJC Skillz made this known during an appearance on TVC’s “Your View.” When asked on the issue of personal space by the hostess as regards friends calling one’s husband, the TV star said, “For me, personal space is your personal space where nobody can come into.” Asked if this includes a best friend, she replied in the affirmative. “This is your personal space and yes your friend can come into your house. Your husband can know your best friend and say hello but why will you be calling my husband? What happened? Except it is his birthday and you want to wish him a happy birthday, why will you call him? Or maybe you have been trying to reach me because you want to talk to me and you can’t reach me, maybe then you can call him.” Funke Akindele with JJC Skillz, their twins as well as her step-children Watch the chat below: Unless it’s his birthday, it’s wrong for my best friend to call my husband – Funke Akindele : @TVCconnect pic.twitter.com/ww2A9Pgkl0 — #BBNaija Laila Ijeoma (@LailaIjeoma) July 11, 2019  It would be recalled that the 41-year-old Akindele first married Kehinde Oloyedele on May 26, 2012 but that marriage crashed about a year later when the two went their separate ways in July 2013 stating irreconcilable differences.
