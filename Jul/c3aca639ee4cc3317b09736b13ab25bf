Manchester City winger, Riyad Mahrez scored a late winner from free-kick for the rampaging Desert Foxes of Algeria to reach their first AFCON final in 29 years. The Algerians were gifted a free-kick on the edge of the box by Wilfred Ndidi, and as expectation tilted towards extra time, Mahrez curled his kick beyond the reach of Akpeyi to end Super Eagles’ fourth AFCON title quest here in Egypt. The Algerian pair of Belaili and Baghdad Bounedjah kept the Super Eagles defence line under constant pressure as the Foxes’ pace threatened Eagles’ rear time and again.  It was Ighalo’s fourth goal in the tournament, but Mahrez struck the winner for Algeria on the dot of the four minutes added time for stoppages.  Sunday’s 2-1 defeat to Algeria was Akpeyi’s first defeat in the competition. He kept four matches for the Super Eagles, which Nigeria won. He was in action in the first game against Burundi, and the team triumph 1-0 in Alexandria. Akpeyi was also in goal in the second group match against the Syli Nationale of Guinea, which Nigeria won 1-0 to pick a ticket to the round of 16.
 
He was rested in the last group match against debutant, Madagascar, where Nigeria suffered a 2-0 defeat. The former Warri Wolves goalkeeper, Akpeyi returned to action in the round of 16 matches against defending champions, Indomitable Lions of Cameroon and Nigeria won 3-2 to hit the quarterfinal. He was called to duty in the quarterfinal cracker against a resilient Bafana Bafana of South Africa, which the Super Eagles won 2-1 to hit the semifinal.
