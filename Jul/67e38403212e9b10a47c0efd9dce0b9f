Too much of a good thing is not good for anyone and this appears to be true in the case of female rap sensation, Cardi B. The Grammy award-winning “Press” crooner recently delivered a stellar performance at the Wireless Festival in the UK but it appears that the mother of one got carried away during her performance. As the “Bodak Yellow” rapper gyrated on the ground and sang one of her songs, she yanked off a blue wig she was wearing at the time and threw it to the excited crowd. Sharing the viral video which captured the moment the festival-goers scrambled for the hairpiece on Twitter, Cardi B begged for its return as she said she was carried away at that time. ‘I GOT CARRIED AWAY …….I want my wig back:/ Dm me,’ she tweeted.  Check it out below:  Cardi B’s career may only be a few years old but she is already making big waves. She got her start on VH1’s “Love and Hip-Hop” in 2015. Her debut single “Bodak Yellow (Money Moves)” catapulted the rapper to the top of the Billboard chart. This achievement made her the first female rapper to do so with a solo single since Lauryn Hill’s “Doo Wop (That Thing)” in 1998. With her additional endorsement deals, Cardi B has eclipsed a net worth in the millions as her net worth is a reported $8 million now. Since rising to superstardom, Cardi B has been headlining music festivals and collaborating with other chart-topping artists.
