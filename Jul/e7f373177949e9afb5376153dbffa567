The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and the Nigerian Policing Programme (NPP) on Sunday, took the campaign of anti-cultism and drug abuse to churches, sensitising them on its consequences. The event, which held at the Catholic Church of the Holy Spirit, Ojodu, Lagos brought both parishioners and religious leaders together to talk on the war against cultism and drug abuse, which they said is truncating the lives of youths in the country. The Lagos State intervention officer of NPP, Ivy Basil-Ofili, said the programme was brought to the religious gathering in other to meet the members of the society. “The reason why we are holding this program in church today is because the church is where you find the family, which comprises the father, mother, children and youths.” In her lecture on the process of addiction and consequences of drug abuse, a consultant psychiatrist, Dr. Olajumoke Koyejo, explained the steps of addiction and advised the youths to run away from drug abuse of any kind, noting that it starts from one sip and then to addiction. “Life is meant to be enjoyed, but when you start taking anything that ordinary you shouldn’t take, it ruins your life and make you fall into crime. Some youths sell their parents property while they are still living in it to buy drugs because they are addicted to one particular drug or the other. We should try and stop all forms of drug abuse,” she said. Also speaking on cultism and its effects, a consultant on cultism and drug abuse, Iyke Chukwuma, said before blaming the government, citizens should also blame churches, mosque, and parents for the prevalence in the country.
