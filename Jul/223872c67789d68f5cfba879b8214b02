To probe Ijegun pipeline explosion
The Senate has sent red alert to the South African government over its ineptitude concerning mysterious and unresolved death of Deputy Director-General of Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria, Elizabeth Ndubuisi-Chukwu, in that country as well as other victims. Ndubuisi-Chukwu, a mother and an indigene of Anambra State, was found dead in one of the rooms at the Emperors Palace Hotel and Convention Centre on June 13, 2019 where she lodged. The Senate is not taking the matter lying low as it came down heavily on the country by warning Nigerians wishing to visit South Africa to be cautious. In its response to a motion of urgent national importance moved by the Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe, the upper legislative chamber resolved to send a high-powered delegation to the Parliament of South Africa to ask their government to do something immediately. It also resolved to urge President Muhammadu Buhari to take the issue of Xenophobia against Nigerians in South Africa seriously. It also asked the South African government to carry out investigation into the death of Mrs. Ndubuisi-Chukwu and other Nigerian citizens in such suspicious circumstance in South Africa. Meanwhile, Senate President Ahmad Lawan, in his comments, said Nigeria is a responsible country hence it does not take the laws into its hands through any form of retaliation.
However, he said Nigeria should not be taken for granted. “We believe that the relationship between South Africa and Nigeria must be better and there must be respect for each other. “South Africans are safe, very well protected in Nigeria, So, there is no needfor any South African citizen to take the life of any Nigerian or any other citizen. Meanwhile, the Senate has mandated its ad-hoc committee probing the recent Rivers State explosion to extend its scope to last week’s pipeline explosion, which occurred in the Ijegun area of Lagos State. It also directed Nigeria National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and Pipeline and Product Marketing Company (PPMC) to review its security architecture for its pipelines. The NNPC was also mandated to consider the engagement of local communities and vigilantes to protect pipelines from vandalisation. The resolution was sequel to a motion sponsored by Solomon Adeola and others, who signed as co-sponsors. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
