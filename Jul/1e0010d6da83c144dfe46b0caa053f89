President Muhammadu Buhari Tuesday said security challenges are not peculiar to Nigeria alone as the nation battles insurgency, kidnapping and banditry. “Every country has security challenges, while we have made significant progress in fighting against terrorism, we acknowledge that there are new and emerging challenges of Kidnapping and banditry,” Buhari said when he received executives of Buhari Campaign Organisation in Abuja. Buhari’s statement came a day after former Nigeria president Olusegun Obasanjo warned him on the rising state of insecurity in the country. “This issue (insecurity) can no longer be ignored, treated with nonchalance, swept under the carpet or treated with cuddling glove,” Obasanjo said in an open letter. Obasanjo accused Buhari of “poor management or mismanagement of diversity” that led to the gathering of a “very onerous cloud”. The former president said failure to address the security issues would result in “rain of destruction, violence, disaster and disunity” in Nigeria. Obasanjo has been a staunch critic of President Buhari, writing series of stinging open letters and statements. Both of them were allies before Buhari’s election in 2015. In 2018, Obasanjo accused Buhari of poor economic management, nepotism, gross dereliction of duty, condonation of misdeed in the country. The former president was also absent at Buhari’s 2019 inauguration and the democracy day celebration. Meanwhile, Buhari has said those criticising his administration over ‘isolated’ cases of insecurity are not patriotic. “Those who politicize the isolated incidents of insecurity are not patriotic Nigerians. I am confident that this administration uses all the resources at its disposal to protect the lives of all Nigerians and not just prominent Nigerians but all. He promised Nigerians to renew efforts in securing the country, fighting corruption and strengthening the economy.
