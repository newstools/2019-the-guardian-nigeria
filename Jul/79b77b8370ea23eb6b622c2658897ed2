 MultiChoice  The app will be available for free download through the iOS and Android app stores. Speaking on the new initiative, Chief Executive Officer, MultiChoice Nigeria, John Ugbe said the platform will put the power of self-service in customers’ hands and allow them to manage viewing preferences, clear error codes, check account balances, make payments, change packages and update their details anytime, anywhere. “And with the start of season four of reality TV show, Big Brother Naija, customers get 100 additional votes to keep their favourite housemate in the competition when they vote via the MyGOtv app. “The new app will form part of the numerous digital platforms that are innovative and functional to meet the ever-changing needs and demands of our valued customers,” he said. Once the app is downloaded, GOtv customers, regardless of the package subscribed to, can log on using their customer details (Last Name OR Mobile Number PLUS their IUC Number) from their data enabled device. Once logged in, the MyGOtv mobile app allows customers to manage their GOtv account from the comfort of their homes. Ugbe said: “By enabling customers to independently manage their accounts, we expect to see a reduction in queries and queues at the call-centres, thereby freeing up our customer-facing staff to provide improved one-on-one support to those customers who require it. Our goal is to provide an accessible, affordable and efficient platform for self-service to improve overall customer experience when engaging with GOtv”. The functionality of the MyGOtv app will continually be assessed and updated to adapt to digital technology advancements that will improve customer experience.
