Students of Nawair-Ud-Deen Grammar School, Solu-Ifo, Ogun State, recently won all the medals at the second edition of the All Nigeria Confederation of Principals of Secondary Schools (ANCOPSS) Literary Festival LITFEST. At the festival, held at the Pakoto High School, Pakoto, Ifo, the school took first positions in the five events it participated in: Debate, quiz, poem recitation, miming and expression and handiwork exhibition. The competition, which combines both senor and junior classes, was contested by 18 secondary schools in Ifo Local Government Area. Each school was mandated to contest in a maximum of five events, from the total of 10 events. The feat is an addition to laurels won by the school in recent times, one of which was the International School Award (ISA) in Dubai, where it won the Best Junior School Award, having displayed its prowess as the best in schools within the area, which has been attested to by the quality of students churned out by the school. The School’s English Teacher (Junior Class), Mr. Babatunde Sanyaolu, who attributed the success to hard work and commitment of the students, said the school would continue to maintain the standard, to put Ogun State in the right position in the country.“We are doing everything within our capacity to give the students good education, which they are displaying to the world. This feat is nothing but a task to do more. We are making a name and we won’t relent on our oars,” he said. The Principal of the Junior School, Alhaja Memunat Arogundade, who congratulated the students, said the school is on the path of making a good name among its peers. She attributed all the achievements to the dedication and commitment of the teachers, who she described as best among the rest.
