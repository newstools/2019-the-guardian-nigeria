The House of Representatives Committee set up to resolve the crisis in the Bauchi State House of Assembly has concluded its investigation and vowed to ensure that justice is done on the complaints from across the state. Headed by Musa Sarkin Adar, the 12-man committee, which began collation of complaints from aggrieved lawmakers and critical stakeholders on Monday, has returned to Abuja to submit its report to the National Assembly. Addressing newsmen yesterday at the House of Assembly after a visit to the chamber, Adar said 28 memorandums and oral testimonies were received during the investigation. He said the petitioners cooperated with the panel, as they answered all questions asked, adding that their cooperation would go a long way to help the panel and that the feedbacks would help in their report to the National Assembly. Meanwhile, the Police in Bauchi also testified before the panel yesterday, as the Commissioner of Police (CP), Habu Sani Ahmadu and Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Mohammed Yakubu absolved the command of any complicity in the crisis. Narrating what happened at the Assembly Complex on June 20, Yakubu, who first spoke to the panel, said the clerk of the House received a letter to provide security ahead of the inauguration of the Ninth Assembly. He said upon receiving the letter, they drew an operation order for the inauguration and sub-divided the operation into sub-sectors one to seven, adding that policemen were sent to the Assembly Complex to prevent anyone from gaining undue access through the fence. “The Clerk then gave tags to those who will be allowed into the Assembly gate, but we had to verify those who had tags before allowing them in,” he said. He added that no policeman was allowed into the chamber, saying all affairs of the Assembly, including the provision of security, were the duties of the Clerk and Sergeant at Arms.
