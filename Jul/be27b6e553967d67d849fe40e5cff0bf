The first phase of the 2018/2019 Nigeria Volleyball Premier League (NVPL) finally kicked off at the weekend inside the Indoor Sports Hall of the Stephen Keshi International Stadium, Asaba, Delta State. The League, according to the organizers, had been shifted severally due to the Zone Three Africa Club Championships, which took place in Lagos and the All Africa Games qualifiers in Abidjan. Owing to the conclusion of the Nigeria Volleyball Division One League in Ilorin last week, the federation has now shifted focus to the Premier League in Asaba. The Chairman of the League Management Committee, Professor Olatunde Morakinyo declared that eight men and seven women’s teams would participate in this year’s league. The teams are Nigeria Customs, NSCDC, Nigeria Police, Nigeria Immigration, Kano Pillars, Plateau Rocks, UCEM (Enugu) and Famous Spikers in the men’s category, while Nigeria Customs, NSCDC, Nigeria Immigrations, COAS Spikers, Benue Queens and Kada Queens make up the Women’s league. Morakinyo said the league would help some of the All Africa Games bound players to keep fit ahead of the competition. “The Premier League in Asaba will give advantage to some of the players who will represent Nigeria at next month’s All Africa Games in Morocco. “The competition will be tough because all teams are coming with young and old players, who want a place in the respective national teams,” he said. He urged registered players to abstain from banned substances, warning that players caught in the act would be banned from participating in any volleyball tournament in the country.
