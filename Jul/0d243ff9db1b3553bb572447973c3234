Gov. Simon Lalong of Plateau Plateau State Governor Simon Lalong has urged Nigerians to see the Ruga settlement initiative introduced by the Federal Government as the same policy with ranching. Lalong, who fielded questions from newsmen after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday, stated that the controversies trailing the programme were unnecessary, saying it was aimed at addressing constant clashes between herders and farmers in parts of the country. “I am a member of the committee. We addressed the issue and some people said they prefer open grazing in their state, some said they prefer ranching, while some opted for the Ruga model. “So, different states have different approaches, but Ruga is not general to everybody. In Plateau, we call it livestock something instead of Ruga and we have explained this to people,” he said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
