Phyno is on a roll as he ushers us into the second half of the year with The Bag. Phyno confirms that his account is like Yokozuna, and has chicks that wants to ball. He also warns you not to debate this with him and delivers this message smoothly. The video celebrates the igbo culture, dance moves and clothing. This comes right after his trending hit single Agu.
