Ed Sheeran, in an interview with iHeartRadio’s Charlamagne Tha God confirmed reports that he got married to his childhood sweetheart, Cherry Seaborn. While discussing his No. 6 Collaborations project in the interview, he explains the lyrics of his new song with Eminem and 50 Cent – “Remember My Name,” – where he called Seaborn his “wife.” “Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted / My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick,” the lyrics say. The singer went on to say he had written the lyrics before him and Seaborn got married. “It was actually before me and Cherry got married, and I knew that we’d be married by the point that the song came out. Someone’s gonna hear that and be like, ‘Oh, they’re married!’ I didn’t know how that would be construed, but obviously it’s already come out,” he said. Ed Sheeran announced his engagement to Seaborn in January. Watch the full interview below:
