 [FILE] Uyo, Akwa Ibom. Photo/Akwa Ibom  Head of Operations in the Department, Mr Joy Koro, who disclosed this, during routine surveillance in Uyo, said: “Today’s routine surveillance exercise is an attempt to check the compliances to our regulations in various filling stations in the state. We have noticed that some filling stations sell petroleum products with DPR seal and we are going to sanction them accordingly.” He further explained that, if a filling station had violated FG’s seal more than twice, the department would report the filling station to its headquarters, which could lead to the withdrawal of DPR’s licence from the defaulting station. He advised the public to stop patronising filling stations that go contrary to the department’s regulations, while motorists should be watchful and calm when buying petroleum products. He said his agency was committed to ensuring that marketers do not cheat residents in pricing, dispensing and distribution of the product.
