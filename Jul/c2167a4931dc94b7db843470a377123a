A parade of costume changes, a touching “I love you sincerely fax machine” message, a kind robot, and an edible Ed have all been assembled in the spirit of the latest No. 6 Collaborations Project music video.   Check out my video for the next single, Antisocial with @travisscott, was so fun shooting this. Link in bio. Can you spot the movie references? A post shared by  Ed Sheeran (@teddysphotos) on Jul 12, 2019 at 4:01am PDT  The Dave Meyers directed video is whimsical and full of famous movie references. The Sheeran x Scott Collab is indeed an ode to the Weird and Antisocial. In an interview with iHeartRadio’s Charlamagne tha God, Ed Sheeran spoke on Travis Scott and confirmed he found much in common with the ASTROWORLD rapper. “He has it, and we were talking about it, and I think he’s very lucky that the girl that he’s with [Kylie Jenner],” he said. “He says that they have a similar thing where that they just have their little circle.” Watch ‘Antisocial’ via YouTube below;
