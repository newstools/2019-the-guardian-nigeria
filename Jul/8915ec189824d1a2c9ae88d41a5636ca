After what can be deemed one of the most impressive streaks by a new artiste, Idahams is backing up his run with a new extended play dubbed Amayanabo. This comes with a colourful video for the project’s lead single of the same title. The 6-track EP references his exhilarating rise from the creeks in southern Nigeria, to prominence in the country’s vibrant music scene. From anthems of gratitude to declarations of royalty, the Amayanabo project finds the singer expressing an array of emotions through a variety of sounds that pay homage to his roots. Amayanabo is translated as King in Ijaw, a tribe in southern Nigeria and through the EP, Idahams declares music as the platform for his kingship. Watch:
