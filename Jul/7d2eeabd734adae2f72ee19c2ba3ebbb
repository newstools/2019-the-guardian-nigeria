The son reportedly said it has been his fatherâ€™s habit to put his fresh catch between his teeth. However, this time he swallowed the fish, which apparently blocked his airway, causing him to stop breathing. The report did not mention the size of the fish. The victim was taken to a local hospital but was declared dead, the report added.
