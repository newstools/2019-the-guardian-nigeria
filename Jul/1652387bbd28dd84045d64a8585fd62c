Maritime workers, under the aegis of Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria (MWUN) may embark on an indefinite strike from today, thereby shutting all ports to operations. The planned strike, according to the group, was necessitated by the flagrant disregard for the rule of engagement and failure of the International Oil Companies (IOCs) operating in the country to pay the wages of the stevedoring workers.President-General of union, Adewale Adeyanju, said: “After our meting today (Tuesday), it was agreed that the strike will commence tomorrow (Wednesday) morning in all the seaports. We have fully mobilised our members. Enough is enough.” “As a responsible union, we cannot continue to fold our arms and watch our members die prematurely because of the non-chalant attitude of the IOCs management towards the welfare of our members.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
