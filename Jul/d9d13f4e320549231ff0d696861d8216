 NSITF office  He said: “that is the vision of the fund; that is what this new board wants to pursue and realize, because in realizing that, the mission has also stated that a deliberate proactive action in the provision of social security protection is safety net for all Nigerians.” Enejamo-Isire said this in Lagos when the Board members paid a condolence visit to the family of Dr Mohammed Yinusa, a member of the board, who died recently. Until his death, Yinusa was the President of the Nigerian Employers’ Consultative Association (NECA), and represented the Association on the NSITF Board. Enejamo-Isire described the late Yinusa as a man with enormous capacity, huge professionalism, and well-packaged in such a way that will attract anyone, and regretted that members were not able to strategize long enough in moving the board to the desired level before his sudden demise. On more awareness for the scheme, he said: “When you propagate what is the inherent benefit in any policy; be it social or commercial, if that benefit is properly sent across to the beneficiaries, they will embrace the scheme. “We can only ask that the human capital content of the Fund be embedded into a team spirit for us to deliver this result. We know we are on course to delivering qualitative service to Nigerians and can set the standard for social security delivery in the African continent. “We will try and see how we can key into creating awareness and sending this message into the subconsciousness of the employers, and if that is done, you need not to preach further, the people will embrace the scheme naturally.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
