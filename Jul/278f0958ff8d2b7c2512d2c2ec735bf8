The trees were planted at both Ewutuntun Junior Grammar School and Ewutuntun Senior Grammar School in Mafoluku area of Oshodi, Lagos State. President of the club, Rtn. Joshua Gana Magin, disclosed that the club would do more for the schools. He noted that the tree planting comes under the economic and community development service, which is one of the six basic areas of focus of Rotary International. The principal of Ewutuntun Junior Grammar School, Mrs. B.M. Abiiba, appreciated the club for selecting the school for the tree planting exercise. She also thanked members of the club for establishing and sponsoring an Interact Club in the senior school, with pupils learning at an early age how to serve humanity. “We are extremely grateful for your kind gestures to the school and like Oliver Twist, we would request for more. In many of the classes, the furniture, doors, and windows are bad. Whenever the students write their examinations, a situation where all the students would be present in class, some of the students have to sit on the floor to write their exams. We would be glad if you can assist us in this regard to ease the plight of the students.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
