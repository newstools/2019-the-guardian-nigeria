Head of Nigeria National Office (HNO), Mr. Olu Adenipekun, who disclosed this to journalists at WAEC’s Yaba office in Lagos, said out of the 1,590,173 candidates that sat the examination, 1, 020, 519 candidates, representing 64.18 per cent, obtained credits and above in minimum of five subjects, including English and Mathematics. This is 10 per cent higher than last year’s results, where 50 per cent of the candidates obtained a credit pass in five subjects, including English and Mathematics. However, Adenipekun disclosed that results of 180,205 candidates, representing 11.33 per cent of the total number of candidates, were being withheld in connection with various reported cases of examination malpractice, which were being investigated, assuring that the outcome would be presented to the appropriate committee of the Council for deliberations. The HNO noted that the committee’s decisions would be communicated to the affected candidates through their various schools.
Adenipekun further disclosed that a total of 1,309,570 candidates, representing 82.35 per cent, obtained credit and above in any five subjects, with or without English and Mathematics, adding: “1,596,161 candidates registered for the examination in 18, 369, recognised secondary schools in Nigeria. Of the number, 1,590,173 candidates sat for the examination, which was also administered to candidates from some schools in Benin Republic, Cote d’Ivoire and Equatorial Guinea, where the Nigeria curriculum for the senior secondary school were in use.
 
“I also wish to report that a total of 1,918 candidates with varying degrees of special needs were registered for the examination. Out of this number, 299 were visually challenged, 842 had impaired hearing, 158 had low vision, 75 were spastic cum mentally challenged and 85 were physically challenged. “All these candidates with special needs were adequately provided for in the administration of the examination. The results of these candidates have been processed and released along with other candidates.“Of the total number of candidates, 822,098 were male, while 768,075 were female, representing 51.70 and 48.30 per cent, respectively.”He said details of the results were already available online and candidates who have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Council were free to check the details of their performance on the website: www.waecdirect.org. “The result checker PIN and serial number needed by candidates to check their results online are contained on the candidate’s smart identity card used during the conduct of the examination. Certificates of candidates whose results have been fully processed and released will be ready within the next 90 days,” Adenipekun added.He dismissed reported cases of leakages of examination papers, saying some unscrupulous supervisors and students who took photographs of the subject papers in the course of the examination and attempted to post them online were arrested and handed to the Police for prosecution.
