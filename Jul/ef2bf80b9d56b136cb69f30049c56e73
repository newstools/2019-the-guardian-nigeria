computer • Screens Muhammad for confirmation as CJN
Disturbed by the falling standards of education, the Senate yesterday resolved to make computer literacy compulsory for teachers and pupils in private and public schools nationwide. The resolution, which followed a motion sponsored by Akon Etim Eyakenyi (Akwa Ibom South), urged the Federal Government and stakeholders to establish “computer facilities for proper training of pupils and students in computer knowledge.” The lawmakers enjoined the three tiers of government be fully involved in the project. Contributing, Godiya Akwasiki (Nasarawa North) reminded his colleagues that Section 21(b) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) mandated government to provide science and technology education. Bassey Albert Akpan (Akwa Ibom North-East) noted that pupils of private schools were better off in computer education. Aishatu Dahiru (Adamawa Central) pointed out that inadequate power supply was adversely affecting computer education. Ibrahim Shekarau (Kano Central) advised owners of private learning institutions to employ teachers who are computer literate. In his contribution, Senate President Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan said the National Council on Education must see to the implementation of computer education, adding that the upper legislative chamber would address its funding. Besides, the senators will today screen Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad for confirmation as substantive Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN). He has been acting since January 25 this year when his predecessor, Justice Walter Onnoghen, was suspended for non-declaration of assets.
