 Executive Director, Systemspecs, Deremi Atanda  SystemSpecs in a statement said it would leverage NIBOX’s self-service payment terminals strategically located throughout Nigeria, and online through its innovative mobile platforms. Through this partnership, it added that services such as federal and state governments’ payments, electricity recharge token, airtime and data phone top-up, cinema tickets purchase, insurance premium payment, cash transfers, and other utility bills would be accessible on NIBOX touchpoints. It added NIBOX had deployed 55 terminals in Lagos and Abuja, with plans to deploy additional 500 terminals in Lagos and Abuja by the end of 2019. “We are glad to be collaborating with SystemSpecs to deliver new services to customers.
