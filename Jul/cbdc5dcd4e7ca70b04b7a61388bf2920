Nigeria defeated Cameroun 4-0 at home and held the Indomitable Lions to a 1-1 draw in Yaoundé the two times the countries met…last year. As it happened at South Africa 2013 African Cup of Nations before the quarterfinal match between the Super Eagles and the Elephants of Cote d’Ivoire, many Nigerians, who have foreseen defeat in tomorrow’s round of 16 clash with the Indomitable Lions of Cameroon, have started changing their flight tickets to leave Egypt after the game. Ahead of the battle of Rustenburg in 2013, not even the then  leadership of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) was sure of the Super Eagles’ ability to overcome the Ivoiriene team, which had some of the best African players at the championship. So, the NFF and many Nigerians hurriedly changed their flight tickets ahead of that game, but the coach Stephen Keshi led Super Eagles proved bookmakers wrong by winning the tie 2-1. It is the same situation here in Alexandria. Since the emergence of the Indomitable Lions of Cameroon as Super Eagles’ opponents in the round of 16 fixtures, many Nigerians have approached their airlines for change of date. To such people, it might take a miracle for the Super Eagles to survive the Lions, who squandered so many scoring opportunities in their game against Benin Republic to finish second behind the Black Stars of Ghana in their group. They played goalless draw with Ghana in their second group match, though the Lions created more scoring chances. The Guardian learnt yesterday that even some Supporters’ Club members are also in the rush for change of date in their flight tickets. But the various airlines are said to have increased their charges for a change of date.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
