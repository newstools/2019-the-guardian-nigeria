In footage obtained by a local medium, Premium Times, Abbo was seen beating the unknown woman after she pleaded with him not to attack the shop attendant. The assault, which was said to have taken place on May 11, has sparked a wave of indignation among politicians, celebrities, activists. The Senator told Channels Television that he would release an official statement in reaction to the assault video. Abbo noted that the roughly 10-minute video was incomplete, claiming he was at the shop because his sister had been assaulted there and that part was left out. “We will soon release an official statement to the viral video which happened before I became a senator where my younger sister was beaten to a pulp in a shop and I was called upon there;” he said. “where I had to call an ambulance and a police to come to the scene and it got out of hand I was also assaulted,” he added. The senator also said the footage is “old.” “It was my sister that was at the store and she was assaulted; in fact, she fainted in the shop but they compressed the video and cut that part out of it. “They took her out to resuscitate her, the one standing with a cap is a doctor, the doctor had to come to give her life. My sister is not in the video, it was completely cropped out of it.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
