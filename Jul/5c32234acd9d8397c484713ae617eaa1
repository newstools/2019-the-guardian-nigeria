Business activities at Sangotedo Market, Eti Osa, Lagos State have been put on hold by the Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA), due to indiscriminate dumping of refuse and poor hygiene by traders. This was made known by LAWMA’s Director of Public Affairs, Folashade Kadiri, who cited the governor’s executive order on traffic and sanitation matters, which stresses government’s zero tolerance for environmental abuse, including illegal and indiscriminate dumping of refuse. She said government’s efforts at restoring environmental sanity in the area was being thwarted by unhygienic activities of traders, who had consistently violated environmental laws and refused to patronize assigned PSP operators. She said they had strongly warned of severe sanctions, including closure of markets that indulge in indiscriminate dumping of refuse.
