The heat of romance is getting hotter in the Big Brother Naija House as housemates spend more days in the house. With each passing day, we see new friendships being formed and of course, budding romances being teased. During yesterday’s diary session, Mercy has revealed to Biggie that she has a crush on one of the other housemates but she would like to take things slow. According to her, she would prefer to explore things with her love interest outside of the house when the show is over. Mercy made the revelation when Biggie asked her if she has an interest in any of the other housemates and she said,  “Yes, Ike, but I want to slow it down for now because I’ve been through a lot in my past relationships. He is one guy i’ll love to be with after the house.” BBNaija Ike It would be recalled that Mercy is currently up for eviction alongside SirDee, Ella, Tacha and Kim Oprah. She found herself up for possible eviction when Frodd who wields veto power saved himself from possible eviction by replacing himself with her. Speaking about Frodd’s move to Biggie, most of the other housemates revealed that they would have done the same thing if they were in Frodd’s shoes but their choice of a replacement may not necessarily have been Mercy. Last week, the duo of Isilomo and Avala were evicted from the house after just eight days in the house making them the first housemates to leave this year’s show tagged, Pepper Dem. Their eviction surprised many fans with some expressing their displeasure at the unusual eviction.
