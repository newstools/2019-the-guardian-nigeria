There are no direct air links between Algiers and Lusaka, Harare and Gaborone, which will add to the travel time of a squad currently captained by Manchester City star Riyad Mahrez. It is a good draw for Algeria though, as Zimbabwe flopped in the 2019 tournament, Zambia failed to qualify and Botswana took one point from a possible 18 in their last campaign. Senegal, whose top player is Liverpool forward Sadio Mane, face a slightly less daunting travel schedule in Group I against Congo Brazzaville, Guinea-Bissau, and eSwatini.

Madagascar, whose qualification for the quarter-finals was the shock of the 2019 Cup of Nations, was put in Group K with the Ivory Coast, Niger, and Ethiopia. The Ivorians appear the probable table-toppers, while the Malagasy set out to prove they are not one-tournament wonders. Nigeria, who beat Tunisia 1-0 on Wednesday in the third-place playoff, will meet fellow west African nations Benin and Sierra Leone plus Lesotho. Ghana and South Africa are in Group C and both should qualify at the expense of Sudan and the winners of a preliminary round tie between Mauritius and Sao Tome e Principe. Although automatic qualifiers as hosts, Cameroon will take part to gain competitive match practice, leaving Cape Verde, Mozambique, and Rwanda to contest the other Group F place. Uganda, the strongest of the east African nations at the 2019 tournament, is with Burkina Faso, Malawi, and South Sudan or Seychelles in Group B. The four two-leg preliminary ties will be played in October and the group phase kicks off the following month with two rounds.
