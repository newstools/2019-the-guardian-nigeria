About 27,000 displaced persons by the armed conflict in Borno State, have received emergency relief items in Monguno town from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). “These families fled the violence, leaving everything behind them,” ICRC’s economic security field officer in Monguno, Sadiq Baba Ahmed, said in a statement. “These people have been forced out of their homes due to the hostilities and are in a dire situation.” Ahmed said ICRC supported a total number of 4,392 families with mats, blankets, clothes, solar lamps, cooking equipment and hygiene kits among other home needs, to allow them to cover their basic needs. A community leader in Fulatari Camp Musa  Haruna said the people have been subjected to a lot of suffering. He said most of the families have been without a mat to lay their heads on. Ahmed disclosed that there has been a huge influx of IDPs, mostly from Kukawa Local Government since December 2018, making over 12 of the camps in Monguno overstretched. The ICRC said it is planning to construct 2,000 family shelters in some of the camps alongside the supports it is offering to clinics in Monguno.
