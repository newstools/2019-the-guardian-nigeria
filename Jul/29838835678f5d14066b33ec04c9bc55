The House had resolved, among others, that if the governor failed to heed its directives, it would be left with no option than to invoke the provisions of Section 11 (4) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), which empowers it to take over the Assembly until the situation normalises. However, Yusuf Gadi, who spoke on behalf of the ad-hoc committee on Media and Public Relations, explained that the House was forced to tarry awhile, pending the outcome of a similar probe being conducted by the Senate on both the Edo and Bauchi states Assembliesâ€™ crises. He assured that the National Assembly would surely invoke its constitutional powers if the harmonised report of the joint House and Senate committees on the issue is not at variance with the earlier position of the House. The lawmaker disclosed that the ad-hoc committees constituted by Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila, charged with various responsibilities, would continue to discharge its duties, pending the inauguration of the House 109 Standing Committees when the House reconvene from its yearly recess in September this year. Gadi faulted the notion that Gbajabiamila failed to live up to his campaign promises to allocate 60 committees chairmanship and deputy chairmanship positions to members of the opposition political parties saying that 64 of the committees seats were proportionately allocated to members of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Action Alliance (AA), All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) and African Democratic Congress (ADC) To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
