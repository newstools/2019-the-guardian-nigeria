Super Eagles attacker, Alex Iwobi is looking beyond the struggle for the No 10 jersey, which team captain, John Obi Mikel is likely to drop any time from now.
 
There were insinuations yesterday that Mikel might announce his retirement from the national team after the third-place match against the Carthage Eagles of Tunisia at the Al Salam Stadium in Cairo.
 
Mikel featured in the group matches in Alexandria. At a pre-match conference in Cairo on Tuesday, Iwobi washed his hands off the struggle for the No 10 jersey. “Wearing the No 10 jersey is not a priority to me. All I need is to give my best to my country anytime I am called upon. Whether or not I am given No 10 or No 100 jersey is not a priority.
 
Iwobi scored one of the three goals for the Super Eagles in their 3-2 victory against the defending champions, Lions of Cameroun to hit the semifinal of the competition. Apart from aiming to win yesterday’s third-place match, Iwobi says there are many lessons the Super Eagles can learn from semifinal defeat by Algeria.“We always take lessons from our mistakes,” Iwobi said.
