Biodun Fatoyinbo The presidential candidate of the Alliance for New Nigeria Fela Durotoye has called for the resignation of the global senior pastor of Commonwealth of Zion Assembly Biodun Fatoyinbo. Fatoyinbo was accused by Busola Dakolo, a celebrity photographer and wife of singer Timi Dakolo, of raping her twice in a week when she was still a teenager. Fatoyinbo has denied ever raping Busola or any other person. His wife, Modele, also spoke in his defence. “Not even as an unbeliever will my husband rape someone,” Mrs Fatoyinbo said during the church service on Sunday. But Durotoye insisted the COZA pastor should effectively clear his name first before continuing as the leader of the church. “In line with the scriptures, it is only appropriate that he leaves his gift (preaching & teaching) at the altar in order to first go and attend to this matter, reconcile with the truth and, if exonerated, then return to the altar to serve God’s people with his gift,” Durotoye said on Sunday. “This is what great leaders do in every nation we admire. “Great leaders hold themselves to higher standards of scrutiny and accountability to the people they lead.” Despite Fatoyinbo’s denial, hundreds of protesters marched on COZA locations in Lagos and Abuja, demanding the resignation and prosecution of the pastor. An obviously hired crowd also held a pro-Fatoyinbo march in Abuja. A protester told newsmen that he was given N10, 000 to stomp for the pastor.
