Local media carried photographs showing his bullet-riddled car window. Batchelor, 49, played for South Africa’s two largest rivals teams Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs as well as Mamelodi Sundowns, Moroka Swallows and Supersport United. He had a long-running feud with Paralympic sprint star Oscar Pistorius who was convicted of murdering Reeva Steenkamp in 2013. Batchelor claimed the sprinter threatened to break his legs in a dispute over a girlfriend. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
