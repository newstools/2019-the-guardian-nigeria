It would be recalled that we recently reported that Perry and her longstanding frenemy, Taylor Swift squashed their six-year-long beef. Speaking about how she reunited with Swift, Perry said: “It kind of was a process. I sent her a literal olive branch and a note apologizing for my part in all of it when she started her Reputation Tour. I just thought she was about to embark on something new and big and needed the support.” Perry added, “As I was finishing mine, I realized how much we have in common, and maybe there’s only five other people in the world that can have the same type of conversations and understand where we’re coming from and that we should celebrate our commonality and our friendship and be able to be there for each other.”
