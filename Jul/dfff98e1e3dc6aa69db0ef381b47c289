Rihanna recently announced the return of her Diamond Ball which will take place in September, with Pharrell and DJ Khaled as its official performers and Seth Meyers as host. Even though the location for this year’s ball is yet to be revealed, there is so much anticipation already. In 2014, Rihanna stepped out in a sleek red Zac Posen gown, paired with a stunning statement diamond and a ruby pendant necklace for her inaugural ball.

The singer topped up her bold look by stacking two diamond necklaces, one a choker and the other a chandelier-looking piece. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-978027 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rihanna-4.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="1350" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rihanna-4.jpg 900w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rihanna-4-399x598.jpg 399w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rihanna-4-768x1152.jpg 768w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rihanna-4-371x557.jpg 371w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rihanna-4-743x1114.jpg 743w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rihanna-4-160x240.jpg 160w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rihanna-4-320x480.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rihanna-4-400x600.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /> The most recent Diamond Ball look turned out to be Riri’s most daring yet, as her Alexis Mabille outfit included a white lace catsuit with a billowing overskirt that all came together with a dramatic bow. As they say, Diamonds are a girl’s best friend, Riri wasn’t spotted without one. Even though she wore a high-neck ensemble, Rihanna made sure her outfit still had some diamonds with a pair of dangly Chopard earrings. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-978028 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rihanna-5.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="1125" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rihanna-5.jpg 900w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rihanna-5-478x598.jpg 478w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rihanna-5-446x557.jpg 446w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rihanna-5-891x1114.jpg 891w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rihanna-5-192x240.jpg 192w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rihanna-5-384x480.jpg 384w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rihanna-5-480x600.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /> We don’t know what the fifth annual ball’s them is or where it is located yet, but we are certain Rihanna will bring on her A-game.
