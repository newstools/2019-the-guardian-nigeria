Ciara and Russell Wilson are three years stronger together! The 30-year-old Seattle Seahawks quarterback and the 33-year-old singer celebrated their third wedding anniversary on Saturday with a sweet pair of videos which hinted baby number might happen soon. “You know she’s a special, special woman. The way you love, I love that about you. The way you love our kids. You’re such a great mom,” Wilson says to Ciara in an Instagram video. “You’re just an amazing woman, you’re an inspiration to so many people, so many ladies around the world,” he continues. “So, I love you for who you are. Many more years of love, fun and joy… and kids.” At the mention of another child, Ciara yells, “Oh!” and hilariously tries to exit the frame.   Year 3. Happy Anniversary Babylove. @Ciara A post shared by  Russell Wilson (@dangerusswilson) on Jul 6, 2019 at 7:45pm PDT  For their special day, the “Thinkin Bout You” singer also shared a special video to mark their anniversary that was set to her song “Beauty Marks” and borrowed footage from the song’s music video.
