The Project Manager for the business school, Romoke Oladejo, said training will be facilitated by a faculty of both local and foreign experts to bridge the gap in skills needed for the global market.
   
“We also have a support system consisting of community coaches who are on ground to respond to any questions learners have which can be communicated in the comment section of each lesson,” Oladejo said.
   
Courses on the curriculum, according to BLA, are taught by business experts from around the world covering a wide range of business subject areas including marketing, sales, global expansion, business structure and processes, business models and more.
