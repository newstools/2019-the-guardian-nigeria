English-born Nigerian singer, song writer and record producer Odunsi has just released the official music video for his highly sensational song ‘Star Signs’ which features Runtown. The video opens with guests getting ready for a millenial owambe, headlined by Odunsi, who considers himself a modern day Sunny Ade. At the bash, guests are seated according to their Zodiac star signs, adorned in colour-coded Yoruba traditional attire with each colour representing a particular star sign, styled by Daniel Obasi. Although Runtown isn’t present in the video, the glitz and glam accompanied by multiple familiar faces like Santi, Tomi Thomas, DRB’s Teezee, Detoblack among others gives life to the offering and delivers utterly mesmerizing visuals. The artiste took to Instagram to announce the official release of the video with a caption that read;
