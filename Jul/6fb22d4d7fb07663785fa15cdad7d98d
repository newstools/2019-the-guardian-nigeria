Ilechukwu, who was at the N.I.S Pitch inside the National Stadium, Lagos, where the MFM Feeders team qualified for the semifinals of the TREM Cup at the weekend, commended the quality of the tournament, while also praising the efforts of the players at the grassroots championship organised by Bishop Mike Okonkwo. The MFM Feeders team, who are making their second appearance in the annual championships, defeated Little Wonders Football Club 2-1 in the quarterfinal game decided at the weekend. The annual grassroots football competition, which is in its 17th edition, had over 60 male football teams and eight female football clubs in attendance.

He said the finals of both categories would hold at the Yaba College of Technology in Lagos on August 30, adding, “This is part of the church’s contribution towards the growth of football in Nigeria. “The country is blessed with talented footballers, who need just a little support to excel. “There will be prizes for the winning teams, as well as identifying talents that will form the basis of the TREM Football Academy we are currently planning”, he said. The tournament, according to him, has over the years produced players for the country’s national teams. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
