The Ogun State government yesterday announced the opening of a job portal for unemployed graduates in the state. The portal, in a statement issued in Abeokuta by the Governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Kunle Somorin, would register, on a continuous basis, unemployed youths in the state with a view to providing them jobs suitable for their trade and academic qualifications. He gave the site address as http://www.iseya.ng/public/. He said: “To ensure that the citizens and residents of the states are not short-changed, we will send a local content bill for legislative action, such that investors will first look inward to availability of workers in Ogun State and make our youths their primary catchment area when they site their companies here.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
