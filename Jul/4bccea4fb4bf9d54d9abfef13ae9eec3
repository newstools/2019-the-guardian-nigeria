Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari Tuesday commiserated with families of late deputy police commissioner Usman Umar and Channels Television reporter Precious Owolabi who died during the protest by members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN), known as Shiites. “Condolences also to the management and staff of Channels TV, and the Police leadership, over the sad and regrettable loss,” Buhari said. “We salute their commitment to remaining steadfast and dedicated to their professional callings, even in this time of grief.” The protest on Monday, July 22, claimed the life of Usman, who was in charge of operations at the Federal Territory Police Command, a journalist with Channels Television and about 11 Shiites. The Shiites were protesting the continued detention of their leader Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, who was charged with murder in April 2018. El-Zakzaky’s alleged offence happened on December 2015 when Shiites and a convoy of Nigeria’s army chief, Tukur Buratai clashed. The sect began the protest at the NITEL Junction at Wuse 2, Abuja and was disrupted by armed policemen who had cordoned off the road leading to the National Assembly and the Three Arms Zone. Commercial activities at the Central Business District came to a halt as people ran for their lives. The sect members had defiled the security arrangement to checkmate their protest as they invaded the Federal Secretariat, attempting to gain access to the National Assembly. President Buhari, however, assured residents of “Abuja in particular and the country, in general, to go about their lawful activities without fear.” He said the leadership of the country’s security and law enforcement agencies are taking action to safeguard the nation against such attacks.
