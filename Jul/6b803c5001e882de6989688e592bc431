It was jubilation yesterday in President Muhammadu Buhari’s Daura hometown of Katsina State following police rescue of the president’s in-law, the Magajin Garin Daura, Alhaji Musa Umar Uba, from his abductors. Uba was kidnapped on May 1 by gunmen at his residence in Daura. He had returned from the mosque at about 7:00p.m. and was seated in front of his house when the gunmen stormed the area in a Peugeot 406 car.His abductors shot into the air to scare people away, and also shot at the electricity line which left the area in darkness, to aide their escape. Uba was allowed to speak with his family members on the day he was abducted, but was not heard from since then. The anxiety that followed his abduction was turned to joy yesterday as several people trooped to his residence to rejoice with family members over his rescue. An elated younger brother to Uba, Tukur Umar, said the district head was rescued at about 7:25a.m. on Tuesday. Umar said the rescue was done by a combined team of security operatives after a gun battle with his brother’s abductors. Similar jubilation was said to have occurred at the palace of the Emir of Daura, Alhaji Farouk Umar Farouk. Residents who spoke with newsmen expressed gratitude to God and security operatives for the traditional leader’s rescue and safe return. Uba, a retired Assistant Comptroller of Customs, is brother-in-law to president Buhari. He is married to Buhari’s sister’s daughter, and is father to Fatima Musa, wife of Mohammed Abubakar, the president’s aide de camp.
