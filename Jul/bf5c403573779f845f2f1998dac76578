Bethwel Opil, Enterprise Sales Manager at Kaspersky Africa said, “The survey found that there is a desire amongst many consumers to use cryptocurrency, but a knowledge gap is getting in the way of taking the plunge. In addition, many people who thought they knew what they are dealing with, later decided against using cryptocurrency.” On a global level, over 80% of respondents have never used cryptocurrencies underlining the low penetration for digital currencies. Only 10% said they understood how these digital currencies work, with 35% viewing it as a fad. Despite the slowly growing trend on digital currencies, Opil said that paramount to adoption is cyber security. He said it was commendable for government to set up a task force to understand the space and also help in curbing criminal activities fuelled by the use of digital currencies. “Always verify a web wallet’s address and not following links to an online bank or web wallet,” Opil added. “Double-check recipient addresses, the amount being sent, and the size of the associated fee before sending a transaction.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
