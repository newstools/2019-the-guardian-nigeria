Shortly after teasing the release of the video via Instagram, Blueface has released the official music video for “Bussdown,” a new song which features 1/3 of The Migos Offset. In the video, the Thotiana rapper is seen drifting through the desert in a bus, where he encounters aliens, flying saucers, and dancing women. Blueface has recently been at the center of some family drama. Earlier this week, he was filmed by both his mother and his sister Kali kicking them out of his L.A. home. One of his two girlfriends reportedly refused to greet his mom, which initiated the whole ordeal. Blueface’s sister and mother allegedly lived at the home with him before he kicked them out to make room for his new girlfriends. The video was shot and directed by Cole Bennett.
