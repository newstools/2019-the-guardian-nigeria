“Crude oil and its refined products are the lifeblood of the Nigerian national and individual economies. No wonder why every fluctuation in the prices and availability of these items is greeted with widespread reaction by Nigerians.

“It is important to understand that government yielding to pressures from protesters is typically a negotiation of several complicated interests with those of protesters being just one of those interests.

Using a combination of methods, the study will examine the interplay of these interests in government’s decision to (not) renew fuel prices in response to protests,” he added.
