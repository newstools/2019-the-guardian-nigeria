A Chris Brown-Davido collaboration wasn’t anywhere close to the list of team-ups we’ve been expecting. The duo has hinted that there’s something cooking and it will be musically delicious. Chris Brown shared an official photo of his soon to be released song with Davido on Instagram, with the caption “coming soon”. Davido also shared it on his Instagram page with the caption “ !!” The anticipated song is titled ‘Blow My Mind’ and although it has not been released yet, the news is already blowing the minds of both fan bases.   Coming soon! A post shared by  CHRIS BROWN (@chrisbrownofficial) on Jul 11, 2019 at 7:01pm PDT
