 [FILES] Players of Enugu Rangers  A source in Rangers’ camp told The Guardian yesterday that Ogunbote chose not to renew his contract hence the decision to fill the vacuum with Ugwu. A statement by Rangers yesterday said the General Manger of the Club, Prince Davidson Owumi has charged Ugwu to prepare the team for the pre-season preparations, adding that the players retained for the forthcoming season would soon return from their vacation. “There is no room for any vacuum and Ugwu has shown through his actions and technical contributions that he has what it takes to lead our team on a care-taker basis. “As a senior national team player, Benedict distinguished himself. As a player of Rangers, he was full of the ‘Never Say Die’ spirit. Even when he took his game overseas, he was a great ambassador of the club and country. “When he came back, he showed some great stuff with the feeder team. Naturally, it is the belief of management that he has what it takes to guide us before a substantive technical adviser comes around,” Owumi said. Apart from spending 10 years playing for Enugu Rangers, Ugwu also played for the famous BCC Lions of Gboko, under the tutelage of the late Shuaibu Amodu, winning the Challenge Cup (now Aiteo Cup) in 1989 before adding the CAF Cup Winners Cup title a year later.
