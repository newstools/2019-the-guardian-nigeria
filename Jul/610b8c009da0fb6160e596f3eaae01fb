The Stade Luigi Ferraris side only maintained their status in the Italian top-flight thanks to a superior head-to-head record with 18th-placed Empoli. The youngster is Juve’s sixth close-season signing after midfielders Aaron Ramsey and Adrien Rabiot, defenders Merih Demiral and Luca Pellegrini as well as the return of legendary goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. Juve has won eight straight Scudetto titles but Maurizio Sarri’s side has failed to lift the Champions League since 1996.
