Nigerian Government on Monday signed a roadmap seeking to nearly triple power supply in the West African nation in partnership with the German Government and Siemens AG. President Muhammadu Buhari who met with the Joe Kaeser, the president of the German technology firm, Siemens AG, said the partnership will help achieve “7,000 megawatts of reliable power supply by 2021 and 11,000 megawatts by 2023.” Only about 4,000 megawatts reliably reaches consumers despite there being over 13,000 megawatts of power generation capacity. “Our intention is to ensure that our cooperation is structured under a Government-to-Government framework,” Buhari said. “No middlemen will be involved so that we can achieve value for money for Nigerians.” Buhari expressed worries that the initiative may not solve all the demands facing the power sector, he said the initiative “has the potential to address a significant amount of the challenges we have faced for decades.” Despite being the largest producer of energy in Africa, Nigeria has struggled to supply electricity throughout the country for decades. The government is also planning to sell 10 electricity generation companies to private investors this year in its bid to to boost power supply. The government has set up a committee for the sale of the remaining companies established under the National Integrated Power Project.
