The Civil Society in Malaria Control, Immunisation, and Nutrition (ACOMIN) has asked the federal government on the need for strategic intervention to curb malaria burden in the country. National Coordinator of ACOMIN, Ayo Ipinmoye, who made the call in Abuja advocated increased funding for malaria interventions at all levels of government in order to bridge the existing funding gap. He observed that malaria was a global public health problem and that of 15 countries that accounted for 80 percent of global malaria deaths in 2016, Nigeria has the highest-burden. He noted that 97 percent of Nigeriaâ€™s population risk infection with malaria, while children under five and pregnant women constitute the most vulnerable. Ipinmoye added that the government and its partners, especially Global Fund, have made significant efforts in the fight to eliminate malaria in the country.
