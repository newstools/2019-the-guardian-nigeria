 Shorunmu  The report circulated yesterday that the NFF has concluded plans to send Rohr to Germany to upgrade his knowledge in coaching. Reacting to the reports, Shorunmu advised the federation to also include Agu and Amapakabo in the exercise, noting that the federation, which administers football in the country, has the prerogative to retrain any of its employees when the need arises. He submitted that it would not be fair for the body to send only Rohr for a refresher course abroad without including the Nigerian coaches, who are also members of the technical crew. Shorunmu enjoined football followers not stop castigating the NFF for intending to send the Eagles’ manager for a training course, saying all hands must be on deck to ensure Nigerian football reached an enviable height in the nearest future through any positive channel. Shorunmu said he was not in a position to discuss Rohr’s coaching pedigree, stressing that his employers, the NFF, know the reason they are sending the expatriate for a refresher course in Germany. “I don’t have anything against the NFF sending Rohr for a refresher course abroad. There are certain things that need no external interference. The NFF is in charge of football in the country and if they still believe in Rohr, there is nothing anybody can do about it. “But I believe if they are focused on developing Rohr, they should also include Alloy Agu and Imama. These coaches are Rohr’s assistants and they also need more exposure in the area of coaching. “Their experience will add more value to the country in the future. I am surprised that it is only Rohr that the NFF wants to send for a coaching course abroad. There most be holistic approach in developing the Super Eagles,” he said.
