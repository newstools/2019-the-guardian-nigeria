It was a fun-filled evening for Port Harcourt residents, as highlife sensation Flavour headlined the quarterfinal showdown in the ongoing Hi-life fest 2019. Carnival ground, Elakaiha, Port Harcourt, played host to hordes of highlife music lovers, who turned out en-masse to witness the spectacle. The Hilife Fest quarterfinalists were fresh off an exciting trip to Lagos, which saw them meet with some of Nigeria’s leading entertainers including Selebobo, Sunny Neji, KCee and Phyno. The contestants on the night were quick to put to use the lessons learned from the mentorship in Lagos, as we saw these highlife hopefuls deliver some truly breathtaking performances.

He expressed his delight at being able to give consumers more options to enjoy Life Lager, while also remarking on the Hi-Life Fest initiative, and assuring consumers that Life Lager will continue to deliver exciting initiatives like this in the future.
