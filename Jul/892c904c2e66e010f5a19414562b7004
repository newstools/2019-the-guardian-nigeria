The Chief Research Officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion linked the sustained sell-off to negative sentiments and high sell pressure in blue-chip stocks due to political risk arising from the lack of policy direction from the government According to him, this has been worsened by the rising insecurity challenges across the country. He noted further that the delay of the federal government to provide economic direction and reform policies that can stimulate productivity, in addition to the absence of a cabinet for effective governance have continued to constrain investment in the market and entire economy. However, he expressed optimism on the likely impact of portfolio repositioning for the second half of the year in the midst of expected second-quarter results, especially for the banking stocks.
