 Ondo  According to reports from the riverine community, the 70-year-old grandmother and others were trapped in a fire incident that happened at the wee hours of Saturday. Sources disclosed that two of the grandchildren had been living with the grandmother since the untimely death of their father some years ago. They were: Wisdom, nine years, Gbana (seven), Biddaddy (five) and Jennifer, three. The Guardian learnt the cause of the inferno was still a mystery, but an eyewitness said the incident might be due to the cooking fire in the deceased’s kitchen. He added that aside the deaths, property in the house were also burnt to ashes. A resident of the community, who pleaded anonymity, said the fire started about 12:00am when the deceased were asleep. Everybody in the community was awake in the middle of the night when the fire started, but there was nothing we could do to rescue the victims. Everything was destroyed. “We are yet to know the cause of the fire, but we suspect it could be cooking fire that was not properly put out in the kitchen because we use firewood here and there is no electricity in the community.” He also revealed that the matter was immediately reported at the Arogbo Police Division, while the bodies of the deceased had been deposited at a hospital. The State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mr. Femi Joseph, confirmed the incident and said investigation had begun.
