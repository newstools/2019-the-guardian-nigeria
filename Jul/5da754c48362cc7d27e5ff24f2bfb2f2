Senior police official Mohammad Ali Babakhel said the accident took place in a remote location with little communication, meaning officials did not learn of it until well after it happened. “People only came to know about the incident when a second boat carrying passengers passed through the area,” he told AFP. “The rescue operation is still going on but there are little chances of survival,” he said. Babakhel said the locals in the northern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa use boats for travelling because the roads in the area are unpaved and it saves them time.
