Nigerian rapper Blaqbonez is letting Africa know he isn’t here to play. The rapper released a five-minute song titled “Best Rapper In Africa” which is already being received with both positive, negative and mixed reactions on social media. Having witnessed one-hit wonders, several diss tracks and major bars from the likes M.I Abaga, Vector, Mode Nine, Jesse Jagz, AKA, Cassper Nyonvest,  Sarkodie, among others around the continent, it is hard to draw a conclusion as to who the title fits. With the song’s acronym B.R.I.A currently trending with different hashtags on Twitter, maybe we could consider adding Blaqbonez to the long list of contenders for that hip-hop crown.
