 Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo. Photo/Twitter/SeyiAMakinde  Makinde, who spoke during a media chat to mark his first 30 days in office, revealed that the state was owing over N150 billion, and that some parts of the debt were questionable. He maintained that Oyo people might occupy Ajimobi’s house, if he revealed all atrocities the former governor committed while in office, including awarding road contract for N2 billion per kilometre. Makinde also threatened to jail any member of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) caught disturbing public peace. Meanwhile, chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Oyo, Alhaji Kunmi Mustapha, has called on Makinde to probe Ajimobi over the N7 billion Ibadan-Iseyin road project. Ajimobi’s administration, in February 2018, approved the rehabilitation of the 65- kilometre Moniya-Ojutaye-Iseyin road for N6,952,565,074.97, and the project was expected to be completed within 18 months. However, Oyo APC has described Makinde’s comment on Saturday as further reflection of his unpreparedness for the exalted office of governor. According to the Oyo APC chairman, Chief Akin Oke, the governor made certain statements that reflected his ignorance of governance matters. For appointing the first female, Mrs. Olubamiwo Adeosun, as Secretary to the State Government (SSG) in Oyo, Women In Politics Forum (WIPF) has commended Makinde. A government statement had noted that the appointment marked a clear departure from the past in the 43-year-old Pacesetter state. President of the non-governmental forum for women, Ebere Ifendu, stated yesterday: “The board and membership of Women In Politics Forum express our hearty congratulations to you on your election as governor of Oyo and most profoundly the appointment of a woman, Mrs. Olubamiwo Adeosun, as the first female SSG of Oyo.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
