A spokesman for the provincial government Liaqat Shahwani confirmed the attack, telling AFP it took place during rush hour in a busy market inside the city. “Most of those injured were passerby,” Shahwani told AFP. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack. Baluchistan, Pakistan’s least developed province, has long been plagued by Islamist militancy, sectarian violence, and a separatist insurgency.
