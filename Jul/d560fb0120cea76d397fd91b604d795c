The World Championships are scheduled between September 28 and October 6 in the Qatari capital. “I am very disappointed to be kept from defending my hard-earned title, but this will not deter me from continuing my fight for the human rights of all of the female athletes concerned,” said the South African who is also a two-time Olympic gold medallist. Semenya’s representatives said in a statement that, on Monday, “a single judge of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court reversed prior rulings that had temporarily suspended the IAAF regulations pending the outcome of Caster’s appeal against the CAS award”. “In this latest decision, the Supreme Court emphasised the strict requirements and high thresholds for the interim suspension of CAS awards and found that these were not fulfilled.” Dorothee Schramm, the lawyer leading Semenya’s appeal, added that the judge had made a “procedural decision” that has no impact on the appeal itself. “We will continue to pursue Caster’s appeal and fight for her fundamental human rights. A race is always decided at the finish line.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
