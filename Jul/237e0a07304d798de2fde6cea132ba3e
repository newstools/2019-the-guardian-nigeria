 Secretary General of the Federation, Boss Mustapha and other representatives of the Federal Government with NFF chieftains and Super Eagles’ players and officials at the Abuja Airport.  “We commend you for finishing third best in the whole of the African continent. We all wanted the first position but this is football where things sometimes do not go as you plan. The Government of Nigeria is quite happy with your level of discipline and professionalism and how you comported yourselves creditably as Nigerian ambassadors.
 
“The fighting spirit and resilience you demonstrated in Egypt is a reflection of the never-say-die spirit of the Nigerian. We want you to keep it up. I congratulate the technical crew led by Coach Gernot Rohr, the players and the staff of the team. “I also wish to congratulate the captain of the team, Mikel Obi that we heard has now retired from international football. We wish him well and thank him immensely for his many years of excellent, patriotic service to the nation.” On behalf of the team, Ahmed Musa thanked President Muhammadu Buhari and the Federal Government for the support given to the team before, during and after the AFCON 2019, promising that the Super Eagles will endeavour to do better at the next championship.
