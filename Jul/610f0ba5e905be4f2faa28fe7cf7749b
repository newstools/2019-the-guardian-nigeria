His remains were strewn along a more than 50 metre (yard) stretch of pavement near a metro station in Intilaka, an AFP correspondent reported. Resident Ibrahim Mejri, 35, said: “I saw him running to try to get away from the police then suddenly he blew himself up.” Thursday’s bombings in Tunis killed a policeman and brought back memories of deadly 2015 attacks on foreign holidaymakers and security personnel that dealt a serious blow to the country’s vital tourism industry. “The two suicide bombers were identified and a significant number of arrests made,” the ministry spokesman said.
