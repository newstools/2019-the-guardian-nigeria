 Cameroon players react at the end of the the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) Group F football match between Cameroon and Ghana at the Ismailia Stadium on June 29, 2019. OZAN KOSE / AFP  Looking ahead to the intriguing match, Coach Gernot Rohr highlighted that the Super Eagles have one advantage over the defending champions. “We have this little advantage that they played on Tuesday and we played on Sunday, so let us try to have an advantage physically and also mentally because everybody wants to do very well now,” Rohr told the Super Eagles Media team. Rohr believes all the omens point to another Nigerian win as they thrashed Cameroon in their next game after losing 2-0 to South Africa in 2017. “There is something similar, we lost 2-0 at home to South Africa and then there was a Cameroon game. Now we lost against Madagascar 2-0 and it is again Cameroon, so it can be a good omen, I hope so. “Everybody wants to do well especially after this disappointment against Madagascar, we changed the team, we wanted to play with some other players to keep them in the rhythm of the competition. “Now the best team has to start and to do the best to make Nigerians proud.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
