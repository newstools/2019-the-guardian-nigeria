 One of the six International aid agency workers kidnapped by the Boko Haram militants on has pleaded for quick government intervention in a video published on Wednesday. The aid worker who identified herself as Grace feared she and others may be killed if they are not rescued or freed fast enough. “Some aid workers were caught and also asked to be released but because Nigeria did not do anything about it, they were killed,” Grace said. “I am begging on behalf of all of us here, that please Nigerians should not allow such to happen to us,” Grace said. “I also want to count on Nigeria, our nation… we are Nigerians and we are also working for Nigeria. I beg that Nigeria government should please do something to see that we are released.” The footage obtained by Nigerian conflict journalist Ahmad Salkida and published by The Cable showed five sitting around Grace. Behind them is a sheet with the logo of the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR. The six persons, working with Action Against Hunger, were abducted seven days ago while travelling along Damasak road, Borno State. The driver of the vehicle is reported to have been killed. A statement issued by the humanitarian organization on Friday said the aid workers are suspected to have been kidnapped by the group pledging allegiance to Daesh. Grace said they were kidnapped by a militant group called Calipha. It is unclear if the group belongs to either of the Boko Haram or its splinter group loyal to the Islamic State, Islamic State’s West Africa Province. “We were caught by this army called the Calipha,” Grace said. “We don’t know where we are.” The abduction comes nine months after Islamic State’s West Africa branch executed a Red Cross aid worker who was kidnapped alongside two others in Rann community in Kala Balge Local Government of Borno.
