SCI Area Operation Manager for Lagos, Cross Rivers and Akwa Ibom, Mr. Ajumobi Kayode, said the wellbeing of children has been the priority of the body for over 100 years. “Our Emergency Fund allows us to respond wherever the need is greatest. We believe in the power of children and do whatever it takes to make sure they survive, get protection when they are in danger, and have the chance to learn”. Mother of one of the victims, Mrs. Ifeyinwa Ikwueze, said her daughter, Joy Ikwueze spent three months at Gbagada General Hospital. She asked other well-meaning Nigerians to come to their aid because they still need financial assistance. Chairman, Lagos Island East local Council Development Area (LCDA), Mr. Salau Bashua, commended the SCI on their quest to put smiles on the faces of the victims and asked other NGOs to emulate them  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
