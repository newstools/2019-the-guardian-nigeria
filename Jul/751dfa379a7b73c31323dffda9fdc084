The apex court dismissed the appeal of Senator Ademola Adeleke challenging the declaration of Gboyega Oyetola as the winner of the Osun State governorship election. The Supreme Court in a split judgement on Friday agreed substantially with the Court of Appeal which ruled that a majority judgement delivered at the tribunal was a nullity. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)in September 2018 declared Oyetola winner of the Osun governorship election after a controversial rerun. Unsatisfied with INEC’s declaration, Ademola Adeleke of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, filed a petition against Oyetola of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) at the tribunal. The tribunal declared Adeleke winner of the election in March. Gboyega appealed the verdict of the tribunal. In May, the appeal court nullified Adeleke and declared Oyetola as the winner of the election. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
