The first phase of the Chevron Junior Tennis Development programme is set to serve-off on July 22 at the Lagos Lawn Tennis Club, the organisers have announced. The coaching programme will also take place in target Chevroncommunities across Nigeria, as well as in Abuja. The programme, which will cover 100 potential stars between the ages of12 and 16, will be run by certified national coaches and coaches from the community, who will be trained to institute and continue the training of outstanding talent. “It is important that we find ways to keep our youth engaged during the weekends and holidays to wean them from negative pursuits and bad habits. Sports is one sure way to achieve that,” GodwinKienka, director of theInternational TennisAcademy, organisers of the programme, said. He added: “Sports is the second largest employer of labour in the world and the programme has an empowerment component where we identify the best talents and help groom them to stardom. At this time when the winner of the WimbledonChampionship, for instance, is getting $3 million, we owe it to our children all over the nation to position them to compete for all the monies in the sports world.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
