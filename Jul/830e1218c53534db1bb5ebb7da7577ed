 Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi and Daniel Olutope in his office. Photo/Twitter: EkitiStategov  Daniel, a student of St. Michael’s African Primary School, Ado-Ekiti, got the opportunity to become the state’s governor after Fayemi visited his school. Fayemi paid a courtesy visit to Daniel’s school on May 7, 2019. Daniel chatted so intelligently that Fayemi asked if he could be his friend and possibly visit him at home. Daniel was accompanied by his mother, Mrs Oluwatoyin Olutope and his teacher, Mrs Dupe Adeosun to the Governor’s office in Ado Ekiti. Mrs Olutope said the visit was “surreal to her and she was elated to see her son sitting in the Governor’s chair, a sign that her child could be governor in future like Dr Kayode Fayemi.” Mrs Adeosun also commended the governor for inviting her alongside the boy, stating that such a gesture would not only encourage other teachers but also raise hope in pupils that they too could become great in future.
