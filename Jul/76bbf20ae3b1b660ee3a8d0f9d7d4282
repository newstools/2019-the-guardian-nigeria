The Rotary International District 9110 has revealed plans to eliminate the spread of cervical cancer, congenital heart diseases and also poverty in Lagos and Ogun states. The new District Governor, Dr. Jide Akeredolu, stated this yesterday at a media parley preceding his installation, where funds would be raised to undertake key humanitarian projects for the 2019-2020 Rotary year. According to Akeredolu, under his watch he will mobilise funds from volunteers within and outside Rotary circles to bring the projects to fruition. He further hinted that the cervical cancer prevention programme has become a priority to his administration going by the alarming rate at which lives are being lost to the deadly disease in recent times. World Health Organisation statistics shows that 26 women die of cervical cancer in Nigeria daily. This translates into one cervical cancer death every 55 minutes. Cervical cancer is unique because it is completely preventable by vaccination against the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). The District Governor added that a significant proportion of funds raised during his tenure will be devoted to addressing the needs of people who are in extreme poverty through empowerment programmes, using the existing Rotary Vocational Training Centre in Igbogbo, Ikorodu, as a pool from where beneficiaries would be sourced. This, he said will be in fulfillment of Rotaryâ€™s commitment to giving hope to the vulnerable people around the world. The installation holds on Saturday, July 6, at the Muson Centre, Lagos and will be graced by Prof. Wole Soyinka, Dr. Reuben Abati, and the Oba of Lagos, Oba Rilwan Akiolu.
