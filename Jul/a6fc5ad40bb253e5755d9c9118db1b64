U.S rapper, Tyga is the latest celebrity to show solidarity with ASAP Rocky after he was arrested in Sweden on July 3 following an altercation before his performance at SMASH festival. Tyga took to Twitter on Thursday, July 11 to announce that he has “decided to cancel my show in Sweden this Sunday July 14. I will not be performing,” before adding the hashtag, “#FREEASAPROCKY.”  A few days prior, Rocky’s supporters started a Change.org petition in hopes of setting him free, detailing that Rocky and his colleagues have been denied their right to counsel and could remain in jail under “inhumane conditions” until a trial is scheduled for mid- to late August.
