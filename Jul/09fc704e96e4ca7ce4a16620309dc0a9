Speaking with The Guardian in Enugu, Eya stressed that the deliberate desire to favour a section of the country over others by the government was creating infractions among the populace. He said: “That was how the Nigeria/Biafra war started. It started like a joke that people who were living together suddenly became enemies, because of the resolve of a few leaders to keep an ethnic part of the country on their knees. “The experience of that era was traumatic and that is why we are saying to Nigerian leaders, don’t push people to the wall. What is going on now in Nigeria is exactly the same thing that went on before the war. People were being pushed to the wall as if it is a crime to belong to the country called Nigeria. People, who don’t know war, should never pray for war because like those who sow whirlwind, you reap the storm.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
