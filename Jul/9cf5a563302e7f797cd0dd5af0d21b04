Former Super Eagles striker, Nwankwo Kanu has warned the players to sit tight and win tomorrow’s match against the Indomitable Lions of Cameroon in Alexandria, Egypt.
 
Kanu, who is in Egypt as an ambassador to the Nigerian team, told The Guardian at the Helnan Palestine hotel just before he joined the players for their evening training yesterday in Alexandria, that the match against Cameroon is like ‘war.’
 
“Any match between Nigeria and Cameroon is always like a war situation. They always sit tight whenever it comes to playing the Super Eagles. We have that great rivalry from long time ago, and it is a score to settle. I want our players to have that at the back of their minds. “Cameroon are the defending champions, but I see the Super Eagles beating them to the ticket on Saturday because we have a great team that is strong enough to win this title.”
 13 years ago when Egypt hosted the African Cup of Nations, Kanu was in the Super Eagles squad that lost to Cote d’Ivoire in the semifinal here in Alexandria.
 
This time around, he says the Eagles are capable of conquering all opposition in the competition. “As I said, we have a score to settle inside the pitch on Saturday. Over 200 million Nigerians are behind the Super Eagles, and I see victory coming our ways,” Kanu stated. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
