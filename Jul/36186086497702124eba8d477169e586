No matter how close a team or group is, “life happens” and things tend to change. For Spice Girls, it was getting older and finding more – getting married, kids, entrepreneurial journeys – in their individual lives than doing music. In a recent interview with Vogue Germany, a former member of the group, Victoria Beckham discussed her decision to not participate in the recent Spice Girls reunion tour, revealing that it took some serious guts for her to say no. “It took me a lot of courage not to go on tour with the Spice Girls again, but to be the one who says, ‘You know, I’m not doing it because things feel different now than they used to,'” she said. “I’d rather concentrate on my family and my company.” “I’m 45 now and very happy to be the woman I am,” she added. “I’m not trying to change, I want to be the best version of myself. Before I turned 40, I wasn’t that confident. I learned to listen to my gut feeling.” Back in January, Beckham admitted that a part of her would “feel a bit left out” once she saw her former bandmates performing together again because “a part of me will always be a Spice Girl.” However, she noted that “what I do now is my passion and a full-time job.”
