Members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) Monday clashed with officers of the Nigerian Police during a protest in Abuja. The group, also known as Shiites, began the protest at Nitel junction and marched towards the secretariat. The protest, however, turned violent as government vehicles owned by the emergency management agency were burnt by the aggrieved protesters. The protest was stagged two weeks after the Shiites protested to the National Assembly Complex, Abuja. Two protesters were killed and two police officers injured during the previous protest. The Shiites protesters are calling on the Nigerian government to release their leader El-Zakzaki, who has been in detention since 2015. But Presidency of Nigeria Friday, July 19 said the case involving the leader of the Shiites, Ibrahim El Zakzaky, is no longer in the hands of the Federal Government. “As far as this country’s Ministry of Justice is concerned, the case involving El-Zakzaky is no longer in its domain,” President Muhammadu Buhari spokesman, Garba Shehu said. “The Federal Government no more has hands in the matter and to that extent, the government at the centre can be said to be clear of any alleged violations of court orders as being trumpeted every day.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
