Plans to ensure every household uses treated mosquito nets to prevent malaria in the nooks and crannies of Taraba State have begun to yield positive results. The Guardian observed this during the just-concluded house-to- house mobilisation exercise, carried out by the State Ministry of Health in collaboration with the National Malaria Elimination Programme (NMEP) and the Catholic Relief Services (CRC). The exercise, which began on June 29 and ended last Friday, was followed with a mop-up exercise to enable organisers capture all persons in the state. It was aimed at distributing free treated mosquito nets to every household, irrespective of the number of persons sleeping in such houses. The turnout was massive. The Demand Creation Officer of the National Malaria Elimination of the Federal Ministry of Health, Mrs. Hope Obokeh, charged media practitioners not to relent in creating awareness on the importance of using treated mosquito nets, which according to her, would go a long way to prevent the people from dying prematurely.
