The United Kingdom will today know its new premier preparatory to tomorrow’s resignation of Prime Minister Theresa May. It is expected that by lunchtime, the European nation would have welcomed its new leader, as the Conservatives would have announced the winner of the party’s two-horse race leadership contest between former London Mayor, Boris Johnson, and Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt. Johnson, a one-time Foreign Secretary himself, has retained the bookies’ favourite to get the keys to 10 Downing Street since May’s tearful decision to leave office was announced on May 24. Today is her final full day in office, and tomorrow, she will take her valedictory Prime Minister’s Question, PMQs at the House of Commons. Thereafter, the outgoing PM would drive to Buckingham Palace to inform the Queen of her disengagement.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
