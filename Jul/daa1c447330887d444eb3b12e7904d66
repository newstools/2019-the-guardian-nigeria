Photo: TWITTER/NAFDAC  He said similar destruction would be carried out in other Customs Zones in Port Harcourt, Kaduna, and Bauchi. “These drugs to be destroyed here today constitute just a meager number among the numerous seizures already handed over to NAFDAC and NDLEA for destruction in the past. These quantities of seizures recorded by officers have not been without some cost on a series of threats, attacks, maiming and even killing of officers.
   
“Even as we are here, some of our anti-smuggling officers have been receiving threats for their exploits. Smugglers of these drugs are unhappy because we stopped them from making money through destruction of lives,” he said.
   
Director, Registration & Regulatory Affairs of NAFDAC, Monica Eimunjeze, commended the Customs effort in preventing the smuggling of hard drugs into Nigeria even as she advocated collaboration between security agencies and the public to rid the society of hard drugs.
   
She explained that the approved milligram for Tramadol is 50mg and 100mg while higher milligrams of above 100 are prohibited.
   
“We have something to do in controlling the use of this Tramadol in our society. See billions of Naira going down the drain, money that would have been used to build our country. This event today speaks to our hearts, and we say no to bringing in of hard drugs; we say no to the importation of substandard drugs, and we say no to destroyed society,” she said.
