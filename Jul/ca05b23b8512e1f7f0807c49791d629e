The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Wednesday sealed some properties owned by former governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha. The properties include Dews of Hope Hospital traced to Dr Paschal Obi, ex-principal Secretary to Okorocha, Market Square Supermarket, All in One Shop, and premises belonging to Imo State Broadcasting Corporation now hosting Rochas Foundation College owned by Senator Okorocha. “The EFCC wishes to state that operatives of its Enugu Zonal Office, on July 23, 2019, traced and marked some property traced to the ex-Imo State governor, Rochas Okorocha as well as those of his family members and cronies,” EFCC said in a tweet. Other properties sealed include East High Academy and East High College, owned by Okorocha’s daughter, Uloma Okorocha-Nwosu; Royal Spring Palm Hotel and Apartment, a 16 block cum 96 flats and eight bungalow multi-million Naira estate traced to Okorocha’s wife. EFCC officials wrote “Under investigation by EFCC, keep off” on the sealed properties. The anti-graft agency said the seal on the properties was an “outcome of painstaking investigation, and as a result of the failure of those to whom they were traced to, to honour the EFCC’s invitation for interrogation.” EFCC said its operatives “neither “raided” nor “harassed” anyone in the course of the action.” Okorocha, a current serving senator representing Imo West senatorial district had not responded to the operation of the anti-graft agency. However, his media aide, Sam Onwuemeodo, when contacted told journalist, “I am putting a press statement on the development together”.
