 Executive Director, Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria (FRCN), Daniel Asapokhai  “We work to influence international accounting and auditing standard by promoting qualified Nigerians for appointment into relevant international boards and generally, staying involved with the global financial reporting regulatory agenda,” he added.
 Meanwhile, the Country Head of ACCA, Nigeria, Tom Isibor, explained that the forum was part of plans to drive connections among the accounting body’s network of employers, partners, stakeholders and members.
 According to him, the quarterly event, which is a programmed strategy, had in the last quarter, discussed the “Power of Digital”, but now the “Power of Connection”. “The objective is to drive connections among our network- employers, partners, stakeholders and members. Of course, there is value we can derive from each other by working together, with priority to develop the accountancy profession.“FRC just reviewed the code of corporate governance in the country and that code is at the very heart of business. So, since that review happened, we felt obliged, as an organisation that produces accountants and as you know, accountants are the very heart of business and economic management.
 
“So, they need to be aware of what those changes and requirements are for them to function effectively and give appropriate advice. We take things around code of ethics and corporate governance seriously. This is one of the avenues that we engage our members.“The world is constantly changing, except trust, which emanates from ethics, culture and processes. As ACCA staff and employee, you have to go through code of ethics, review and update, to ensure that you don’t violate them,” he said.
