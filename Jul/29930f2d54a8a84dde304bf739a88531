Osun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola “The Progressive God that Osun people serve heard their prayers and granted their request; that Gboyega Oyetola, who won last September’s governorship election, should be so confirmed by the Supreme Court. God has used the highest legal authority of the land to proclaim the truth that Oyetola lawfully won. And that is historic!!!” The statement above was how the elated spokesperson of Osun APC, Kunle Oyatomi, celebrated the Supreme Court’s judgment which has finally validated that the PDP lost the governorship election. According to the APC chieftain, “our fears for the calamity that might have befallen the state of Osun, if the PDP had been declared winner, have now been assuaged.“We are overjoyed for this amazing Grace! Those who had wished for a different outcome have a lesson to learn here, that there is a natural limit to which you can stretch evil. “It was this limit the PDP got in their attempt to stage a miraculous upset at last September’s election.“And subsequent efforts to spin the law at the Tribunal unraveled in the Court of Appeal and finally died at the Supreme Court today (yesterday). The details are now history,” the Osun APC spokesperson said, adding that, “for good measure, this is not simply a victory for the party alone; it is a victory for the good people of the state of Osun.” Oyatomi continued, “Providence has by this verdict, put a stamp of approval on the exceptional developments achieved in the state during the last eight years. “God also stopped the evil in its track that had planned to dismantle the hard earned human, social, economic, environmental and structural developments that Ogbeni Rauf Adesoji Aregbesola and his team established in the state of Osun.
