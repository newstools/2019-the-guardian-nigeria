The University of Calabar Teaching Hospital (UCTH) is indebted to contractors and other creditors to the tune of N3 billion. The Chief Medical Director (CMD), Prof. Ikpeme Ikpeme, who disclosed this in a meeting with creditors and hospital contractors at weekend, appealed for patience and cooperation, promising that the two months old management under his leadership would work out a payment plan. Ikpeme, who was flanked by other management staff at the meeting, said that the hospital was embarrassed that the “only advanced and well-equipped ambulance we have is impounded by a court order and has been in the court premises for so long. “Out of the N2.5 billion to N3billion indebtedness, what we are owing pharmaceutical companies is not up to N200million. We will pay. The aim of our pharmacy is to have like 90 to 95 percent of our pharmaceutical needs. It’s been good so far. In fact, some of the things we are appealing, we have started doing them already”. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
