Here are some things you might not know about snakes: There is a specie of snake called the boa constrictors, these species can reproduce without mating.  Parthenogenesis is a form of asexual reproduction that involves the development of an egg into an embryo without fertilization.  If suitable males are absent, the female snakes put out some half-clones of themselves out. Some snakes steal their venom from toxic toads.  This specie of snake is known as Rhabdophis tigrinus; they become poisonous when they eat species of toxic toads. The snakes store the toxins obtained from the toads in glands in their neck. When facing danger, the snakes release the toxins from their neck glands. Pregnant Rhabdophis tigrinus can even pass the toxins on to their young. The toxins protect the young snakes from predators and last until the snakes are able to hunt on their own. According to scientific reports, researchers are said to be studying snake venom in the hope of developing future treatments for stroke, heart disease, and even cancer. Snake venom contains toxins that target a specific receptor protein on blood platelets. The toxins can either prevent blood from clotting or cause clots to develop.
