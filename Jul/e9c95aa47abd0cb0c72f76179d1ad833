Speaking with The Guardian on Sunday, Omokaro said the Eagles’ boss lacked the technical ability to read games and select players without sentiment for national assignments. He wondered why the federation would still be seeking to retain a coach who could not change the format of a game when it mattered most in the 2018 World Cup and the 2019 AFCON. Omokaro also expressed concerns over Rohr’s dependence on overseas-based players, saying it has negatively impacted the development of the Nigerian league. He said Nigeria needed a credible domestic coach to lead the Super Eagles, pointing at the successes recorded by some of the local coaches with the junior national teams. “I am surprised that the NFF still want to retain Rohr and even send him on a refresher course abroad. This coach cannot read a game and select the right players that would give him good results. “Based on his performance at the 2018 World Cup and AFCON, he deserves to be driven from the team, sack is an understatement. “I heard the NFF said there is a particular large sum of money they would pay him if they sacked   the coach… this shows the federation knew that issues like this would come up. This is one of the things that take place in the federation,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
