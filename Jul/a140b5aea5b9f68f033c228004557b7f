Tragedy struck yesterday at No. 5, Salako Street, Oshodi area of Lagos at about 4:00p.m. when two men fell into the well.It was gathered that the first victim, popularly known as Baba Joker, a plumber in his 60s, had wanted to fix the pumping machine in the well when he missed his step and fell inside the well. Concerned neighbours looked for a mallam to help rescue him but unfortunately the mallam also fell into the well. When The Guardian visited the scene last night, fire service personnel were already on ground. They rescued the mallam at about 9:30p.m. Efforts were still ongoing to rescue the plumber, who many think may have died considering the time he slipped into the well.
