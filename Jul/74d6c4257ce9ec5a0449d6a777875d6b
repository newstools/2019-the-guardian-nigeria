 [files] Governor Udom Emmanuel. Photo/Twitter/MrUdomEmmanuel  Last week, Ekere and his party had closed their cases, as the former is seeking a fresh governorship election in Akwa Ibom State, abandoning his earlier statement that he won the election and should be declared a winner. With this development, the defendants, Emmanuel, and others are expected to open their defense before the date is taken for addresses. They closed their case last Thursday after Obong Ekere went outside his earlier statement deposed before the tribunal, which he adopted as his evidence to call for a total nullification of the entire exercise in the 31 local councils of the state. Similarly, the APC deputy governorship candidate in the election, Amadu Attai announced that the ballot papers his party obtained from INEC as exhibits in the case were no longer useful and would no longer be tendered before the tribunal.
