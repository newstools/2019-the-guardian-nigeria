Shoki had disparaged Wizkid in a video that made the rounds on social media for not showing love to the street by “settling the boys” when he visited Shitta in Surulere. Hence, he decamped to Davido by praising him. Wizkid responded that nobody messes with us” in a now-deleted Instagram post. This prompted the DMW boss, Davido to promise Shoki Shitta N1m for his ordeal.
