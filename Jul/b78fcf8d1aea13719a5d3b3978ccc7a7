Nigerian footballer and coach, Samson Siasia’s mother, Ogere Siasia, has been abducted by unknown gunmen in her home in Bayelsa State. The gunmen reportedly stormed her house at about 2:00 a.m. in Odoni, Sagbama Local Government Area of Bayelsa State, abducted alongside two others. This is the second time the coach’s 76-year-old mother will be kidnapped. She was abducted in November 2015 by three men on a motorbike in the same village. Coach Siasia was in Gambia on a ten-day training tour ahead of the Super Eagles qualifiers for Rio 2016 Olympics men’s football event, when the incident took place. She was, however, released 13 days after the family paid ransom running into millions of naira. But this time the kidnappers are yet to reach out to the family members. Kidnapping and violent killings are on the increase in Nigeria. Nigerian former President Olusegun Obasanjo Monday complained about the continued insecurity in the country, which he says is “eroding the root of our Nigerian community.” “The issue I am addressing here is very serious; it is the issue of life and death for all of us and for our dear country, Nigeria,” Obasanjo said in the open letter addressed to President Muhammadu Buhari and signed by Obasanjo’s spokesman Kehinde Akinyemi. “This issue can no longer be ignored, treated with nonchalance, swept under the carpet or treated with cuddling glove,” Obasanjo added.
