Hugo Santillan in the ring during his last fight, Photo. Big Bang The boxing world was shaken for the second time this week when 23-year-old Argentinian boxer Hugo Alfredo “Dinamita” Santillan became the second professional fighter in a week to die from injuries sustained in the ring. Santillan was fighting against Uruguayan Eduardo Javier Abreu in Buenos Aires on Saturday night when his nose began to bleed during the fourth round. He continued to fight, but while the judges were announcing the draw, Santillan fainted and was taken to the hospital. Earlier this week Russian boxer Maxim Dadashev died on Tuesday after undergoing emergency brain surgery for a subdural hematoma sustained in his fight with Subriel Matias. The World Boxing Council said in a statement Thursday, “We have received the very, very sad news of the death of the 23-year-old Argentine fighter Hugo Santillán, which happened today at the San Felipe Hospital in San Nicolás, Buenos Aires.” RIP Hugo Santillan. He passed away from injuries suffered during Saturday’s fight which ended in a draw. We join Hugo’s family and friends in grief, support and wish prompt resignation.
