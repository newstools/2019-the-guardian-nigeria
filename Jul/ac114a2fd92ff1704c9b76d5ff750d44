Vogue September Issue. <em>PHOTO: Vogue</em> Nigerian author, Chimamanda Ngozie Adichie features alongside 14 women on the cover of Vogue September Issue. The September issue of British Vogue was guest-edited by Her Royal Highness, the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle. For the issue titled “Forces for Change”, Markle selected an assemblage of women who were “trailblazing change-makers, united by their fearlessness in breaking barriers”. Markle is the first guest editor of the September issue in the magazine’s 103-year history. She said in a statement that she had sought to steer the focus of the September issue, usually, the year’s most-read, to “the values, causes and people making an impact in the world today.” “Through this lens, I hope you’ll feel the strength of the collective in the diverse selection of women chosen for the cover as well as the team of support I called upon within the issue to help bring this to light. “I hope readers feel as inspired as I do, by the ‘Forces for Change’ they’ll find within these pages,” Markle said. Alongside Adichie, the cover features Jacinda Ardern [New Zealand Prime Minister]; Greta Thunberg [teenage climate activist]; Jane Fonda [activist and actor]; Laverne Cox [LGBTQIA+ advocate, actor and producer]; Adwoa Aboah [the mental health campaigner and model]; Adut Akech [a former refugee and model]; Ramla Ali a former refugee and boxer]; Sinéad Burke [diversity advocate and lecturer]. Also on the cover, Gemma Chan [campaigner and actor]; Salma Hayek Pinault [women’s rights advocate, actor and producer]; Francesca Hayward [Royal Ballet principal dancer and actress]; Jameela Jamil [body positivity activist and actor]; Yara Shahidi [youth voting activist and actor]; and Christy Turlington Burns [maternal health advocate and model]. Adichie is the bestselling author of “We Should All Be Feminists,” “Americanah” and “The Thing Around Your Neck,” which have been translated into more than thirty languages. In 2015, she was named one of Time magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in the World and one of Fortune Magazine’s World’s 50 Greatest Leaders in 2017.
