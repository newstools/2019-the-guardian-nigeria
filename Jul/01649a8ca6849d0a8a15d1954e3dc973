The former governor said Ihedioha was taking Imo people and Nigerians for granted with such allegation. Okorocha, who is representing Imo West Senatorial Zone at the Senate, also cautioned Ihedioha to desist from contradicting himself. In a statement signed by his Special Adviser, Media, Sam Onwuemeodo, Okorocha regretted that conflicting figures of incurred debt from N300 billion to N275 billion and now N100 billion pointed to gross inconsistencies. Ihedioha had on Thursday, during an interaction with stakeholders said Okorocha plunged the state into unimaginable financial mess, which he had underestimated. “The governor should not be dishing out figures as if governance has become a child’s play. The disturbing aspect of the whole thing is that when you challenge them to show proof they run away,” Okorocha said. The former governor again challenged Ihedioha to provide proof to back up his claim. He added: “The governor knows how INEC declared him winner but the major candidates are at the tribunal to ensure the correction of that anomaly. We believe that he is doing all these in preparation for a possible re-run.” Okorocha warned Ihedioha to leave him and his family alone and face governance.
