Many efforts of researchers worldwide had gone into ways of seeking design guidelines that include high –precision quantitative and qualitative analysis using simulation in solving wide range of human problems in different fields of human endeavor. Simulation is a very important modern technology in the world. It is being applied to different fields such as science, engineering, or other application for different purposes. To predict the behaviour of the system can be used different variables. Computer simulation can be used to assist the modelling and analysis of the system. In light of ever changing business environment and the effects of globalization on business activities, it is important that simulation must be effectively carried out in order to enjoy the numerous benefits associated with it in the business world. Simulation can be defined as a numerical technique of experimentation used to determine the dynamic behavior of management system using modern technique of information technology and computer software. For example, in managerial decision making, mathematical models can be constructed and then used to test the results of decisions prior to the implementation of such decisions. Resulting outputs of simulation experiments give rough approximations of the real; systems being simulated. The technique of simulation finds great use in various areas of life such as Mathematics, Engineering, Computer science, Art science, Management science. Simulation models are not deterministic. They deal mainly with imitations of reality and are descriptive in nature. These models describe the problem being investigated instead of finding solutions to the problems. Simulation is normally used to assess the current or predict the future, performance of a business process. The concept is designed to help practitioners and business owners discover new ways to improve their business processes through the use of mathematical, statistical and other analytical methods. Simulation typically uses statistical and computer modeling to investigate the performance of a business process either for a new situation or to improve an existing set of processes. By modeling different process scenarios and outcomes, companies can minimize the traditional risks associated with change management initiatives without having to make changes in a live business environment where performance could adversely be affected (Harrington and Tumay, 2000)
In simulation, operational information of the behavior of a system which aids in decision making is obtained unlike that which exists in analytical model techniques.it enables us to simulate reality through imitation and experimentation without changing or affecting the system adversely. In warfare, technical changes may occur as a result of defeat by opponents on some occasions. These expected changes can be simulated so that effective planning could be made to combat the enemy. Change in price of a commodity, especially undue up ward change, which result in failure of a business, the technique can be used to simulate the business environment in such a way that debilitating effect on the business can be prevented. We can use computer simulation to model the prevailing real world and also to observe the effect of drastic changes that can occur if the system is altered. Thus we can analysis complex system without altering the system using simulation when other analytical tools are not powerful enough to analysis such situations, it helps in thorough analyzed in order to generate needed data. In fact, it is an effective learning tool for employees in Business organizations especially with the wide use of management game in business schools. Also in various scientific areas, humanities and management decision situations such as budgeting, stock market analysis as well as analyzing complex organizational problems, one cannot put simulation to the background. In addition, it enables management to state profit and growth objective through sensitivity analysis. It helps in identifying quality control problem in manufacturing process and also identifies techniques that can lead to improved performance as well as areas of possible adjusting and training that can eliminate production bottlenecks. Simulation offers scheduled, valuable learning experiences that are difficult to obtain in real life. Learners address hands –on and thinking skills which include knowledge –in-action, procedures,decision making and effective communication. Critical teamwork behaviors such as managing high workload, trapping errors and coordinating under stress can be taught and practiced. In fact, Health simulation is coming of age and has begun to share much with established methods in aviation, spaceflight, nuclear power, shipping and military. The rapid advance of computer science, bioengineering and design has met demands from all stakeholders for safer, more effective and efficient ethical healthcare. Benefits of Simulation to Government 
As it is all known in management world that planning is fundamental in management, it becomes crucial for everybody to draw up of his or her plan for the day, weeks, months, even for a year. In the same manner, Government of a country is not left out in terms of planning its activities. Effort must be made to ensure that all Government’s plans are well simulated, in order to reduce level of wastage of man and material resources involved. Having realized that resources are scarce, it is essential for any reasonable Government to ensure that the available limited resources are well utilized for the benefits of common man. To bring out the best in Government’s social services, a well piloted program that consider s all related factors that may hinder the success of the program should be adequately considered before the full blown program in order to identify area of weaknesses . In this regard, simulation of activities becomes essential. For example, simulation of government’s transportation network may go a long way to help the Government to identify bottlenecks that may occur in the transportation system. Many of government activities can be effectively simulated before eventually carried out. Information technology today is adding values to many of the activities of mankind and today, simulations are carried out with the aid of computers which improve efficiency and effectiveness in the scheme of doing things in the world. Government can use computer simulation to model the prevailing real world and also to observe the effect of drastic changes that can occur if the system or policy is altered. Thus we can analysis complex system or policy without altering the system using simulation when other analytical tools are not powerful enough to analysis such situations. With the Military, technical changes may need to occur in order to perfect military operations. These expected changes can be simulated so that effective planning could be made to combat the enemy. Applications of simulation in real life situations
Simulation of motion air planes under various types of conditions. Wind tunnels tests of various models of the plane enable the aeronautic engineers to study performance that could occur in real life situations. For airline pilots undergoing training, the ground flight simulation imitates some flying conditions that they can experience whenever they commence real flying of aero planes. Space conditions are simulated and studied using flight simulators before astronauts embark on the real space flight. Simulation of historical events using artifacts in museums
Children’s game like monopoly is also an example of simulations. Also, when children go for ride in amusement parks using the various entertain gadgets they are exposed to simulation of reality. Simulation models of other transportation system, urban corporate planning and water resources simulation model. etc.
