We have to work together for the result to come because any division in the team will affect us on the field of play. I don’t see any reason why we should not work as a team.”
 
Apart from setting his eyes on the Afcon title here in Egypt, Musa who plies his football trades with Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia, revealed that his biggest target as a footballer is to win the FIFA World Cup in 2022. “The World Cup in Qatar is my target, and by the Grace of Almighty Allah, it will come to pass. I want to win the FIFA World Cup as a senior player, and 2022 is the last opportunity I have to do so because I won’t play football forever. I will quit active football after the World Cup in 2022 to stay with my family,” Musa stated. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
