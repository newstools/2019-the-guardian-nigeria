With the installation of a 15MVA injection sub-station at Obawole community in the Abule Egba business unit, Ikeja Electric has promised 18 hours power supply to the people of the community and environ going forward. The community as learnt by The Guardian, has not had more than four hours of power supply in about five years, owing to an overload of the feeder that serves them. The substation according to the Abule Egba Business Manager, Oloyede Adelakun, at the inauguration of the project has two feeders, with one of them being radiated to serve Galili, while the other takes care of Iju, Ishaga, and Osoba areas of the unit. Adelakun, however, urged residents to be energy efficient because once supply increases, they should also expect higher bills, and that for them to enjoy the promised supply boost, they must cooperate to offset the over N400 million owed by the residents.He further highlighted the need for them to desist from acts like illegal connection, meter bypass, and other energy theft activities. The residents were also assured of being metered going forward under the ongoing MAP initiative, noting the importance of cooperating with the meter contractors. Expressing commitment to cooperate with the company on payments of debts and disconnection where necessary, the people of the community also requested for concrete poles, as well as cables, because they claimed all the newer ones were procured through community initiatives. The President of Obawole United Forum, Olu Olajobi appealed to IE to keep to their promises, as the community will keep to its end of the bargain. He added that operations at the substation should not be shallow and that their struggle should be worth the while.
