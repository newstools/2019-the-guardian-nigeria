The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday admitted that the November 16,2019 governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa would be challenging due to the history of political violence in the two states. INECâ€™s National Commissioner and Chairman, Voter Education and Information, Festus Okoye, stated this during a live programme in Abuja. He said the electoral umpire would move its personnel into the two states early enough to meet with critical stakeholders towards achieving free, fair and credible polls. On the electoral reform process, Okoye said INEC would ensure the implementation of recommendations that could be done administratively and work with the National Assembly for the aspects that require legislative backing.
