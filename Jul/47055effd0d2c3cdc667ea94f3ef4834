Former Nigerian vice president Atiku Abubakar Wednesday asked the People’s Democratic Party to sanction Senator Elisha Abbo for assaulting a lady at a sex toy shop in Abuja. “I’ve seen the alleged assault video involving Sen. Elisha Abbo. The video is sad, inexcusable,” Atiku said on Twitter. “I know the Senator quite well. But the law is clear and leaders must lead by example,” Atiku said in a statement on Wednesday. “I advise him to publicly apologize, voluntarily go to the police and show a good example expected of a young leader. I also call on our party, the @OfficialPDPNig to take necessary disciplinary action and the @PoliceNG to ensure the law takes its full course,” he added. Premium Times published a video of the PDP senator Abbo, who represents Adamawa North District, assaulting a lady attendant at the sex toy shop. In the video, Abbo slapped the lady more than three times and ordered his security aide to walk the assaulted lady out of the shop. The Senator in an interview with Channels Television claimed his sister was beaten at the shop and he was assaulted on arrival at the scene in May, while he was a senator-elect after the elections. Nigerian Senate on Wednesday called for an investigation into the assault and said while the matter remains an allegation, it will be investigated and all sides should be given a fair hearing. The Senate president Ahmed Lawan, however, gave the bi-partisan committee set up to investigate the allegations against the senator two weeks to submit its report. Nigerians, members of opposition parties and human rights activists have also called for the arrest and arraignment of the lawmaker.
