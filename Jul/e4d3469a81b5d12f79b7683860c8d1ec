 Governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Ademola Adeleke (left) and former Vice President Atiku Abubakar in Osun State yesterday ahead of the re-run election holding tomorrow.  “Senator Ademola Nurudeen Adeleke, had no intention to contest the Governorship Election in the first place,” Deji Adeleke said in a statement. Rasheed Olawale, a spokesman for Ademola Adeleke, confirmed to The Guardian that statement originated from the elder Adeleke. Deji said the PDP candidate “was invited and prevailed upon by the party leadership and party elders to contest” for the September 2018 election. “He and his family accepted most reluctantly after receiving assurances and promises that were never kept.” Deji is reacting to the automatic ticket the PDP are offering Ademola to re-contest in 2022 after he finally lost the election petition to the All Progressives Congress rival Gboyega Oyetola. He rejected the automatic ticket for his brother stating that Ademola deserves to be “given a break”. He further urged the party to administer a “transparent primary elections” for all elective positions, including the ticket for the “position of governor of the state.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
