Former Internationals, Mutiu Adepoju and Garba, Lawal have reacted differently to the latest ranking by the world football governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA)’s release on Thursday, after the just concluded Total Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), hosted by Egypt. Nigeria amassed 1481 points from 1433 points in the new rating, to climb up 12 spots to 33rd from 45th in the world. But the country still remains behind Tunisia with 1496 points (29th) and Senegal 1550 points (20th) in the Africa’s rating. Speaking with The Guardian yesterday, Adepoju said that despite the latest evaluation of countries by FIFA in the last one month, that the Super Eagles still need to keep on improving on their games to achieve a better result next term. “This is a sign of improvement and I think we should just keep on improving like that. Football is a game that you can never predict the outcome because all matches are different. “Our Eagles got to the semi final and eventually won a bronze medal at the end of the day. Though it was painful that we didn’t win the cup but at least we won the bronze. Don’t forget, every other team that played at the AFCON too wanted to win the title, but couldn’t achieve anything at the end of the day. And we shouldn’t be disappointment about that,” he said. While also reacting to the ranking by FIFA, Lawal said he didn’t see how the new rating would change the Eagles. “When we were in 45th position, what did that change? It didn’t change anything. The most important thing is for us to keep winning our games and more trophies. Whether FIFA ranking or not, it does not change thing about the Nigerian football. “I do not know how they do the ranking, but I don’t care about that. All I care is about is us winning games and trophies,” said the former Nigeria Football Federation technical committee member.
