 Femi Gbajabiamila  The Pro-democracy groups, which gave the advice, maintained the 9th Assembly under the leadership of Gbajabiamila, must get it right from the beginning by doing what is right and just in the face of the law. In separate statements, Progressive Youths Association, Democratic Youths Movement and Centre for Rights and Grassroots Initiative, maintained that rule of law should prevail as regards principal offices in the House. Convener, Progressive Youths Association, Comrade Adeniyi Ojo, said the House has its rules as it concerns majority and minority principal officers, coupled with selection of members into committees, “so, let the rule of law prevail. We will not hesitate to organise mother of all rallies if we see any group that wants to make the House ungovernable for the Speaker.” Hillary Johnson of Democratic Youths Movement said the Speaker should beware of anti-democratic forces within and outside of the National Assembly that are planning to put banana peel on his path. “The minority members in the National Assembly have endorsed those they trust. They must have their way as stated in the House rules.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
