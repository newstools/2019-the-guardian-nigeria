In an interview the midfielder granted media outfit, the 23-year-old admitted that he may only quit Arsenal should he sit out many games. “I am up for the fight but the only time I would consider leaving is if I am not playing as much as I would like to,” Iwobi told The Sun UK. “Obviously, my joy is to play football and not just sit out. If it comes to that I would have no choice but to leave. But I would always put up a fight to play — that is what I have done all my life,” he added. Arsenal have reportedly had a £40m bid for £80m-rated Zaha, who has informed Crystal Palace of his decision to leave the club. However, Arsenal’s first bid was turned down by Palace. But the Gunners doesn’t seem to have given up on his push. Iwobi admits that Zaha’s arrival will mean tougher competition, but insists he will be ready to fight, as usual. Arsenal’s head coach, Unai Emery, has said the club could still sign “three or four very expensive players” before the window is closed in August. Both Zaha and Iwobi starred for their countries in the African Nations Cup that ended last Friday in Egypt. While Zaha could not help Cote d’ Ivoire to a medal, Iwobi starred as Nigeria’s Super Eagles won bronze at the competition.
