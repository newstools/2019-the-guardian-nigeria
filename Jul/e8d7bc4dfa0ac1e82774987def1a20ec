Popular Nollywood actress, Stella Damasus has taken to her Instagram page to advise some feminists to stop portraying other feminists who are genuinely fighting and standing up for the rights of women as bitter women. According to the screen star, the way these set of feminists go about their fight for the rights of women make them come across as bitter. She shared, “There is a huge difference between being a FEMINIST and being a BITTER WOMAN. Don’t blur the lines please. We can’t allow some who are angry, start to create a general impression of what we are trying to achieve. #stelladamasus #nyc#tuesday #authenticity#perfectlyimperfect” Stella Damasus In March 2019, Damasus took to social media to urge all women to do more than put posts on Twitter or Facebook and actively fight for the gender and equality opportunity bill. In her post, she called on all the big shots living in Nigeria who have the voices to speak for the voiceless and the lower class women. It would be recalled that a US activist named Candace Owens weighed in on the issue of modern-day feminism. The lady who was once a feminist condemned the concept and called it a scam. According to her feminism as a concept and practice is not aimed at uplifting others but at tearing women down.
