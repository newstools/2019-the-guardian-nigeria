Rihanna’s Diamond Ball will return this September, with Pharrell and DJ Khaled as its official performers for the fifth annual gala. The 31-year-old singer and business mogul took to Instagram to reveal that the event will take place on September 12, also announcing Seth Meyers as host. Location for the 2019 Diamond Ball is yet to be revealed, however, other editions have been held at New York City’s Cipriani Wall Street for the past two years. The Diamond Ball benefits Rihanna’s Clara Lionel Foundation, which funds education and emergency response programs around the world. Meanwhile, Rihanna is also continuing her beauty world domination. The singer-turned-businesswoman announced that her Fenty Beauty cosmetics line will expand to Hong Kong, China, North Korea and South Korea in September. Also, we are anticipating new music from the songstress; it has been hinted that her next album — rumored to be titled R9 — is coming before the end of the year.
