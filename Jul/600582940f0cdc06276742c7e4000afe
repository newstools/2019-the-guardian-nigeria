The FCT Permanent Secretary, Mr Chinyeaka Ohaa, has assured women that more of them would be involved in FCT administration when the Minister of FCT assumes office. Ohaa gave the assurance on Monday in Abuja when he hosted the new executive members of the Abuja chapter of the National Council for Women society (NCWS). The permanent secretary said that the FCT administration was concerned about the plight of women and children which was the responsibility of the FCT Social Development Secretariat (SDS). According to him, part of the activities of SDS include taking women and children out of the street, providing houses and giving them adequate security. “We will do our best in providing transit camps for the vulnerable women and children. We will also consider all the orphans who are found worthy of employment,” he said. Earlier, the new executive council of the NCWS, led by Mrs. Hadiza Abdullahi, had appealed to the FCT administration to review its N1 million monthly subvention. Abdullahi added that the amount had become too little to solve the overwhelming problems of the vulnerable women and children in the society. She said that the new executive council required a new vehicle to be able to execute its numerous challenges of attending to emergency situations, since the old one had broken down. Abdullahi also asked for a transit camp to house numerous women and children in special needs.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
