The 2015 U17 World Cup winner has performed excellently in the training sessions leading up to yesterday’s big game, scoring brilliant goals against Ikechukwu Ezenwa and Daniel Akpeyi on Thursday and Friday respectively. ‘’I think professionalism [is what I’ve learnt from the more experienced players] because like the captain [Obi], he has been nothing but a top professional for many years and you can see the way he organizes the team,’’ Osimhen told Busy Buddies Nigeria. ‘’It’s not just about the coaching staff, it’s not just about the player but about him also, his personality is on top of this world and he jokes with us whenever it is needed and I think for us he makes us comfortable around him to be able to speak with him, to be able to joke with him and laugh with him. ‘’I think for me there is no better feeling to justify this. I think the captain has been top in his way of leading us.’’ Osimhen ended the 2018-2019 campaign as Nigeria’s top scorer in the European Leagues with 19 goals.
