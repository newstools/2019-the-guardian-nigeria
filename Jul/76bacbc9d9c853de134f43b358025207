 PHOTO:AFP  This is the kingdom’s highest output since March, but it remains 460,000bpd below its quota of 10.31mbpd. Saudi’s oil minister, Khalid al-Falih, assured the market at last week’s OPEC meeting in Vienna that the kingdom will keep its production below 10mbpd in July. Iran pumped its fewest barrels since September 1988 as output remains thwarted by stringent US sanctions. The country saw its production fall 100,000bpd to 2.35mbpd, with dramatic fall in its crude exports somewhat offset by a significant build in crude storage, according to survey panellists. Iraqi crude output fell to 4.77mbpd from a record high of 4.82mbpd in May, on lower exports from its southern terminal, the survey found. Iraq’s quota under the deal is 4.51mbpd. Angola, OPEC’s second-largest African producer, saw its output slide to 1.39 million b/d in June, its lowest since joining OPEC in 2007, according to the survey. The country saw output tumble due to maintenance at some of its key fields along with ongoing technical and operational problems.
 
Libya pumped 1.08mbpd in June, a fall of 40,000bpd from the previous month, the survey found. Technical issues as well as maintenance at some oil infrastructure pushed output lower.Almost 700,000bpd of the country’s crude output remains at risk due to its protracted civil war, according to state-owned National Oil Corporation, which is calling for the international community to intervene in the conflict.
