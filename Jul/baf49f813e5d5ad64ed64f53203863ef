The Super Eagles will be playing against the Indomitable Lions of Cameroon in the Round of 16 of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. Nigeria finished second in Group B after the surprising 2-0 loss to eventual group winners Madagascar. Gernot Rohr’s men were scheduled to face the runners-up of Group F in the second round. The Super Eagles waited two days to find out who their opponents were with the teams in Group F yet to play their final round of games. There was the possibility of a match up with Ghana looming but after Tuesday’s Group F matches, Cameroon finished runners-up. Clarence Seedorf’s side played a goalless draw against Benin Republic at the Ismailia Stadium while Ghana leapt into the top spot in the group after a 2-0 victory over Guinea Bissau in the final group games. Goals from Jordan Ayew and Atletico Madrid midfielder Thomas Partey ensured the Black Stars will face the runners-up of Group E rather than West Africa rivals, Nigeria. Nigeria and Cameroon will face off on Saturday, July 6 at the Alexandria Stadium. The rivals have a storied past in the AFCON with both teams meeting six times at the tournament. Cameroon have won the three(3), drawn one and lost (2) of those games. Both teams were grouped together in the 2018 World Cup qualifiers, with Nigeria qualifying ahead of the Indomitable Lions. The Super Eagles defeated Cameroon 4-0 in the first leg before both teams played out a draw in the second leg in Yaounde.
