Meanwhile, our leader should not compound the challenges facing his presidency by preparing a response to former president Olusegun Obasanjo’s recent letter to him. Professor Itse Sagay, Chairman of a presidential advisory committee in the presidency some careless reporters always quote as if he were part of the presidential bureaucracy, has set the tone for some robust response. The president and his men are well advised to leave the Letter-Writer-General of the Federation, Obasanjo alone. They should realise that the latest letter to President Buhari was well reported as a lead story by all the newspapers that are newspapers in the country. That shows the significance of the content and writer of the letter, which contextually reported the state of the nation. You don’t have to like Obasanjo to consider the salient points raised in the remarkable letter. You can criticise Obasanjo on many issues you think he should have settled as president (1999-2007) but when it comes to issues concerning the unity and survival of this country, even his enemies would agree that he is one of the last men still standing (for Nigeria). There is therefore no need to waste another time preparing a response to the great letter. A useful response will be a power point made on the message for solutions not an attack on the messenger. Obasanjo is an oracle whose word of courage should not be ignored at this time. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
