Nigerian Senate Wednesday commenced screening of the 43-man ministerial picks sent to the National Assembly by President Muhammadu Buhari for confirmation. The first nominee being screened is Ikechukwu Ogah from Abia State. A senator representing Abuja Federal Capital Territory, Philip Aduda, raised a constitutional point of order at the start of plenary to kick against the exclusion of FCT in the appointments. Aduda noted that the constitution stipulates that the FCT be treated as one of the states and each state shall have at least one minister. He urged the Senate to pass the message across to the executive as no nominee from FCT was appointed. Dino Melaye, a Senator representing Kogi West Senatorial district, expressed worries about the same issue. He said the matter is a constitutional point of duty, not an appeal by the Senate.
