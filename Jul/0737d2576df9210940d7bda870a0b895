The Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN), has charged the new Group Managing Director (GMD} of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr. Mele Kyari, to urgently tackle challenges confronting the oil and gas industry.
   
The oil workers identified the challenges to include: pipeline vandalism, crude oil theft, inadequate infrastructure, pricing uncertainties and the contentious fuel subsidy issues among others, which must be discharged very fast.
    
PENGASSAN, in a congratulatory message, and signed by its General Secretary, Lumumba Okugbawa, described Kyari’s appointment as well-deserved and a recognition of his 27 years contributions and exemplary service to the NNPC Group, the nation’s oil and gas sector, and the growing economy that is majorly dependent on the industry.	   
 
“Your appointment did not come to our association as a surprise, because it is a testament to your hard work, dedication to duty and exemplary leadership quality. Our Association having watched your steady and impactful progression over the years welcome this great honour, higher responsibilities and challenges vested with this new appointment.” The workers also commended his predecessor, Dr Maikanti Baru, for his contributions to the growth of the industry, saying that history will remember him for his good works that brought stability to the industry in terms of industrial relations management, and free flow of refined products. PENGASSAN also described its partnership with Baru as legendary, for which they will forever remain grateful, and wished him the best of luck in his future endeavours.
