After releasing the highly anticipated The Lion King: The Gift album at midnight on Friday, July 19, Beyoncé is following it up with a video for one of the album highlights, “Bigger.” “Bigger” is an extended version to previously released “Spirit” which offers up plenty more surreal nature shots and epic Queen Bey fashions. “Life is your birthright, they hid that in the fine print/ Take the pen and rewrite it/ Step out your estimate/ Step in your essence and know that you’re excellent,” she sings in the vibrant visual. The Gift Album was produced and curated by Beyonce and it continues with empowering theme. The Lion King: The Gift is out now. Watch the “Bigger” video below.
