Nigerian youths under the auspices of Social Patriotic Youths Initiative (SPY-IN) have said it could no longer accept a lopsided, failed, and corruption bathed nation as legacy. Briefing the press yesterday in Delta state, convener of the group, Efe Ekure described the legacy as that which cannot be proudly bequeathed to the next generation, adding, “There is no better time to change the narrative than now.” According to Ekure, since the nation’s return to democratic rule in 1999, youths have been kept on the wings and fringes of leadership, which has kept them under the deceptive notion that they are the “Leaders of tomorrow”. He stressed the need for governments at all levels to create enabling environment for youth development, adding that this is necessary for a progressive and peaceful nation. Calling for youth’s inclusiveness in governance and policy formulation, Ekure maintained that it was a clarion call that will lift the nation from the quagmire of unproductiveness and balkanisation of economic strangulation to greatness.
