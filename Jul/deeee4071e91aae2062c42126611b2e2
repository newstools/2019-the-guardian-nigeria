 Atiku Abubakar  In a statement he personally signed yesterday in Abuja, he also advocated the creation of an Electoral Crimes Commission (ECC). “One of the recommendations, which will enhance independence of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is the one that says the power to appoint INEC Chairman and its board be removed from the presidency and given to the judiciary. “Of all three arms of government, the judiciary is the least affected by elections, meaning that it has the highest objectivity in matters relating to INEC. It is, therefore, in the best position to appoint a Chairman and board members for the electoral body that are impartial, competent and patriotic,” the statement reads. Atiku argued that the recommendation may seem like a small change, “but experience has taught me never to underestimate the big difference small changes can make.” On insecurity and poverty, Atiku noted: “Nigeria faces a lot of challenges, chief of which are security and economic revival. To effectively tackle these problems, a government must have an honest and indisputable mandate. “Where you have an administration whose mandate is tainted, such a government will lack sufficient moral authority to tackle the myriad of problems the country currently faces. “I do not believe in blame game. Leadership must be solution-oriented, not focused on blame. This is why I offer this patriotic advice. Nigeria must be great again and all hands must be on deck to achieve that goal.” Meanwhile, Ahead of the November 16, Bayelsa State governorship election, an aspirant on the platform of PDP, Franklin Osaisai, has promised to boost agriculture and security in the state if elected governor.
