Three persons, including a couple, yesterday died when a Lagos-bound commercial bus conveying them from Ijebu-Ode, plunged into Ososa river in Ogun State, along the Sagamu-Ore expressway. The accident, which involved a yellow-coloured 14-seater Mazda E220 bus, lost control on the dual carriage between Ososa and Odogbolu along the expressway, leaving 11 other passengers injured. Operatives of the Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE), Nigeria Police and Federal Roads Safety Corps (FRSC) were sighted battling to rescue victims from the river. The bus, which took off from Ijebu-Ode motor-park for Lagos, comprising five male adults and nine female adults, plunged into the river at about 10:32am. According to Ogun State Sector Commander of FRSC, Clement Oladele, the suspected cause of the crash is mechanical deficiency as it lost control and plugged into the Ososa River in Ijebu Ode. He said the injured were rescued to the General Hospital, Ijebu Ode, and the bodies deposited at the same hospital’s mortuary. As at the time of filing this report, The Guardian learnt that efforts were ongoing to retrieve the bus from the river. Oladele commiserated with the families of the victims and advised vehicle operators to put their vehicles in good condition before any trip and be cautious during the rainy season to avoid road traffic crashes. Also, the Public Relations Officer of TRACE, Babatunde Akinbiyi, attributed the cause of the accident to “mechanical fault.” Akinbiyi added that the injured were evacuated to the Idera Hospital Ijebu-Ode while the dead were taken to the morgue of the State Hospital.
