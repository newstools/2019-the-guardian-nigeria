May said she was “shocked” by the violent protests at Hong Kong’s legislative council building Monday, but noted that hundreds of thousands of people had protested “peacefully and lawfully”. Her comments came just hours after Beijing said it had lodged an official protest with London after British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned of “serious consequences” if it breached the Sino-British declaration. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said Hunt, who is battling ex-London mayor Boris Johnson to succeed May as British leader later this month — was “fantasizing in the faded glory of British colonialism”. It is the second day in a row that China has slammed Hunt for remarks he has made regarding the unprecedented anti-Beijing protests that have rocked Hong Kong in recent weeks. Under the 1997 handover deal from British to Chinese rule, whose terms last for 50 years, Hong Kong enjoys rights and liberties unseen on the mainland. But protesters accuse Beijing of reneging on that agreement with the help of unelected leaders. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
