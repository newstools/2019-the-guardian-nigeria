Nigeria’s inspector general of police Mohammed Adamu Friday ordered beef-up of security in all states of the country and the federal capital territory, Abuja to curb violent protest by members of Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN), known as Shiites. “In order to curb series of violent protest and unrest by members of the El-Zazakky group, the IG M.A Adamu, has ordered the immediate beef-up of security in all the States of the Federation including the Federal Capital Territory,” the police said in a statement. Shiites have clashed with Nigeria’s security operatives multiple times in the last three weeks over the continued detention of their leader Ibrahim Zakzaky since 2015. The most recent clash on Monday, July 22, claimed the life of a deputy police commissioner Umar Usman, who was in charge of operations at the Federal Territory Police Command, a journalist with Channels Television Precious Owolabi and about 11 Shiites. The Shiites claim over 40 of their members died. Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari commiserated with families of the late police chief and the journalist. But the Shiites Tuesday vowed to continue the protests until El-Zakzaky, his wife Zainab and other members regain freedom. “Free EL-Zakzaky protests will continue nonstop unless our leader regains his freedom to go and tend for his seriously deteriorating health condition,” Shiites spokesman Abdullahi Muhammad Musa said. While the protests-turned-bloody clash looks to continue, the police said it has taken proactive measures to ensure the safety and security of lives and property of all Nigerians. The police said all “Zonal AIGs and CPs nationwide, have been mandated to ensure customised security arrangements are put in place in their Area of Responsibilities (AORs) to checkmate the activities of criminals and any possible threat to public peace.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
