Pastor Fatoyinbo Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mohammed Adamu has ordered the Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Force Criminal Investigations Department (FCID), Michael Ogbizi to take-over the investigation of Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo. This is in a bid to ensure a speedy, fair and impartial investigation of alleged rape reported by Mrs. Busola Dakolo against Fatoyinbo, who pastors the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA). DIG Ogbizi will also investigate Fatoyinboâ€™s complaints against the Dakolos and personally supervise all facets of the investigation to ensure justice and fair hearing for all the parties and each case treated on merit. The IGP gave the directive in a statement yesterday by Force Public Relations Officer, DCP Frank Mba. He also ordered that the procedure, which the police operatives adopted in serving invitation letters on Timi and Busola Dakolo on Saturday, July 20, 2019, be subjected to scrutiny to ascertain its conformity with police standard operating procedure and international best practice.
