But thanks to social media, he has been able to become one of the most sort-after and successful artiste to come out of Nigeria. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-981458 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Wizkid.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1460" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Wizkid.jpg 596w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Wizkid-524x598.jpg 524w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Wizkid-210x240.jpg 210w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Wizkid-421x480.jpg 421w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Wizkid-526x600.jpg 526w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> While many are known for their lavish spending when they attain a certain level of success, Wizkid who is worth $12 million (N4.3billion) according to Hopper’s Instagram Rich List told the audience that he is investing and ensuring that the platform he is creating will last a long time. This is asides touching the lives of many including his parents. He also expressed enthusiasm on his new deal with UBA and said that he hopes that this will solve some of the problems encountered in the entertainment industry. “It’s not enough to play a song insulting the government. We all have a role to play,” he notably said. It was after this chat with Group Managing Director of the United Bank for Africa, Kennedy Uzoka, and his announcement as an ambassador that a photo ops was called for and an iPhone was left on stage. An announcement was called which turned to whispers among the audience. Some opined that it was must have been Wizkid who did this. If this was him, we would never know but we know that if it was indeed his, the contacts would have been priority.
