The Presidential Election Petition Tribunal is to rule on the move by the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, to play the video of the February 23 Presidential election. At the resumed hearing Monday, both Atiku and his Party, PDP, called four additional witnesses, who testified of the same issues of alleged votersâ€™ intimidation and fraud by the All Progressives Congress (APC), the Independent National Electoral Commission and President Muhammadu Buhari, in Yobe and Borno Stated respectively. However, before the first star witness and campaign spokesperson of Atiku, Segun Sowunmi was called to testify, the petitioners mounted large screen TV and a DVD player, ready to show the happenings during the election. But the move was objected by lawyers to INEC, APC and President Buhari. The objection was based on perceived ambush by the petitioners, and the fact that it was not contained in the list of documents to be tendered. This position was immediately corrected by lawyers to Atiku and PDP, who pointed to the other parties, where it was contained in paragraphs 38, 39 and 44 of their list of documents. Meanwhile, the tribunal has embarked on a short break and when it reconvenes, it will rule on whether or not the video would be played.
