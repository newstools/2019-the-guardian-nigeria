He said: ” What the Peoples Democratic Party  (PDP) had been brandishing was fiction. The verdict is a vindication of fact over fiction. So, we are glad. It was a judgment of five against two. The judiciary has always been the last hope of the masses. It is only people from the other side that always castigate the judiciary, when judgment does not favour them…” On politicians, who don’t have faith in the judiciary when they lose their cases, he said: “There are bad losers and good losers…Battles are not always for the swiftest. You win some and lose some. That is life.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
