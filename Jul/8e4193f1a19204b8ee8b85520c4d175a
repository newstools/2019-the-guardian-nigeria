Thugs numbering about 500 who are members of the notorious ‘Sara Suka’ yesterday surrendered their weapons to the police in Bauchi State. The ex-bandits, mostly youths, were received by Governor Bala Mohammed and the Commissioner of Police, Habu Sani, at the command’s headquarters. CP Habu said the police under his watch was able to drastically reduce the soaring spate of Sara Suka robbery, kidnapping and other violent crimes through synergy with other security agencies and volunteer groups. One of the surrendered thugs, Rilwan Ibrahim, told The Guardian that the lack of education and joblessness drove them into banditry but they have seen reasons to embrace peace. He said: “We are pleading with the government and police to release our colleagues who are in their custody for years, so that they can join us in embracing peace. We want the government to give us job or create an empowerment programme for us because we don’t want to go back to hooliganism again”. The Chairman, Bauchi State Youths for Peace and Unity, Mr. Rabiu Shamba, said he was able to mobilised them from the grassroots and convinced them to surrender to government for tranquility and developed society. The governor in his reaction commended their willingness to surrender their arms and promised to prioritise youth empowerment that would cater for their future. Bala, who was represented by his Chief of Staff, Abubakar Kari, assured them of government’s readiness to take youths of the state out from extreme poverty.
