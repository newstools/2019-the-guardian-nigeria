 Mrs Olufunmilayo Olotu  Olotu is expected to bring her wealth of experience to bear in the operations of the Lagos Ports Complex (Apapa), and surmount prevailing challenges bedeviling operations at the seaport, and given her antecedence at the troubled Calabar Ports Complex, stakeholders believe her tenure will herald a new dawn in Apapa Port. The Managing Director, NPA, Hadiza Bala Usman, had recently approved the immediate redeployment of the erstwhile Calabar Port Manager, among other ports top officers across the country, a move she said will help the Authority deliver on its mandate to facilitate international trade in a safe and secured environment. Having spent three years in the mantle of leadership at the Calabar Port, Olotu, stakeholders believe she left an indelible footprint on its operations through her uncommon ingenuity. Olotu expressed her appreciation to stakeholders in Calabar Port, saying: “We have achieved a lot since 2016 when I assumed office; at least we can confidently say that the volumes of business activities have increased”. In Apapa port, she promised to embark on an expansive consultation, introduce new initiatives and consolidate on the initiatives of her predecessor. “My slogan in Calabar was, ‘promoting purposeful partnership’, we do not look down on anybody. So, I want to bring bear a creative way of doing things, so that we can also chart new courses for growth,” she said. Olotu succeeds Aisha Ali-Ibrahim, who has been moved to the NPA headquarters as Assistant General Manager Operations. Ali Ibrahim urged her to continue to create a friendly environment, monitor and supervise efficiency of operations to ensure that the terminal operators deliver on their mandate.
