Udeze said Rohr’s ability should not be faulted owing to the Super Eagles performance at the just concluded Egypt 2019 AFCON, stressing that the Nigerian coach deserved more support and encouragement to rebuild the Super Eagles. The former Insurance of Benin player, however, urged Rohr to continue searching for more talented players to beef up the Eagles, adding that Nigeria could be world beaters if the coaches were ready to go all out to search for the best players from within and outside the country. On the goalkeeping department, Udeze said the three current goalkeepers in the team were good enough to mount the post for the Eagles, pointing out that they only lacked enough confidence to command the defenders to correct lapses in the team’s backline. “The Super Eagles need to forget the issues at the 2019 AFCON in Egypt and focus on the competitions ahead. “I don’t think Rohr is a bad coach. He has the technical ability to handle the Super Eagles. The only problem the coach has is that he does not forgive easily when a player makes mistakes on the pitch. Any time a player makes mistake in the super Eagles, that player automatically loses his shirt. Because of this some quality players have been shut out from the team. “The coach needs to work on his temperament and encourage players when they make mistakes. He should also give the domestic and foreign-based players a level playing ground to operate to get the best.“Some players are retiring from the Eagles now, Rohr and his assistants have to go all out to get the best players to beef up the squad,” Udeze said.
