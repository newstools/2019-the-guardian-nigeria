Ighalo, who won the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations Golden Boot, started his career as a youth player in the U-20 team and later made his senior debut during an international friendly match against Uganda in March 2015. He played his first competition with the senior team at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. He came under huge criticisms when Nigeria were eliminated from the Russia 2018 World Cup after missing a glaring chance against Argentina which could have given the Super Eagles’ victory. But the former Watford forward bounced back to become the highest goal scorer for the 2019 AFCON tournament qualifiers and emerged tournament top scorer, notching up five goals. Ighalo made 35 appearances for the Super Eagles and scored 16 goals.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
