The Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta, who made the disclosure at the 107th edition of the consumer outreach sensitisation programme in Lafia, Nassarawa state, said the move became necessary due to the increase in Internet crimes. Danbatta, represented by the Deputy Director, Consumer Affairs Bureau of the commission, Ismail Adedigba, explained the Internet code is a regulatory intervention protection to secure the country’s cyber space against imminent threats from cyber attacks as well as addressing issues such as online child protection, privacy, and data protection among others. Speaking on the theme of the event: “Mitigating effect of cyber crimes: roles of telecom consumers,” Danbatta said even though it is impossible to eradicate cybercrime, the commission would continue to collaborate with service providers to reduce the menace. He said: “To say that we are going to eradicate cybercrime is a tall ambition but what we can do is to educate the public so they will not fall victim of cybercrime activities. People are looking for loopholes to perpetrate crime. If people are informed, they will know how to protect themselves.” He stressed that while the regulatory intervention and other initiatives are ongoing to sanitise the Internet space, telecom consumers must also play their role. Director, Consumer Affairs Bureau , Mrs Felicia Onwuegbuchulam, noted that as the NCC embarked on various initiatives to increase internet access to nigerians, the commission is aware of dishonest individuals who thrive on using Internet for illegal activities. She observed that cybercriminals, including hackers deploy sophisticated systems to intrude into connected devices to perpetrate their exploitation schemes She however, said that without consumers becoming aware of cybercrime trends and making efforts to ensure safe use of connected devices, cybercriminals will continue to make cyberspace unsafe.
