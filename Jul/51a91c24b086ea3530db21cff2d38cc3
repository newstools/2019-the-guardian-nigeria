Senate of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Ogbomoso, has approved the withdrawal of certificate issued to one Oluwanisola Femi Akeju, for refusing to appear before several panels raised to investigate his allegations of victimisation. Akeju, who graduated in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering in the 2013/2014 academic session with the matriculation number 083659, claimed an unnamed lecturer in the Department of Pure and Applied Biology of the University failed him in a particular Biology course for six years. The school said efforts made to ensure Akeju explains his allegations in a publication of March 15, 2018, on Naijaloaded proved abortive as he refused to honour invitations before various panels. LAUTECH said Akeju claimed that he sat for BIO 101, 102, 104 and 106 and scored grade ‘A’ in all of the courses which contradicts the grades awarded by the school where he scored BIO 101 (E), 102 (E), 103 (E). The school, however, explained that Akeju did not register for BIO 104 in his first year in the University until the second semester of his extra year in 2013/2014 session and passed with ‘E’ grade. LAUTECH said it was bothered by ‘unfounded’ allegations on its profile and decided that “all rights and privileges extended to Mr. Akeju Oluwanisola Femi as an alumnus of this University stand suspended.” “Other sanctions approved by the University’s Senate are that issuance of the academic transcript to him is suspended forthwith. The statement of results issued by the University to Mr. Oluwanisola Femi Akeju be immediately invalidated, and that his academic certificate be withheld until further notice,” LAUTECH spokesman Lekan Fadeyi said in a statement.
