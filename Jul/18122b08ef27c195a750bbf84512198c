Sarabia’s arrival makes up for the departure to Bayer Leverkusen of teenage winger Moussa Diaby last month as PSG attempt to balance the books to avoid Financial Fair-Play sanctions from UEFA. PSG, which has opted not to renew the contracts of ex-Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and Brazil skipper Dani Alves, need to find another 30 million euros or so before June 30 to conform to UEFA rules.
