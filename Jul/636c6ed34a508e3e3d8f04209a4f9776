The Muslim Rights Concern has labelled a reality television show, Big Brother Naija, as ‘immoral, dangerous and bohemian’ to the society and subsequently called for its shutdown. BBnaija is a reality show in which about 14 contestants live in an isolated house and compete for a large cash prize worth $100000 at the end of the show by avoiding being evicted by viewers. The Muslim group, MURIC, in a statement issued by its director, Ishaq Akintola, said BBNaija “constitutes a potent danger to every home.” “BBNaija is satanic. It is unacceptable,” Akintola said. “Where are our norms and values? Is it part of African culture to engage in sex in the open?” “Where are the authorities? Is the Ministry of Information and Culture sleeping? Is the National Orientation Agency on sabbatical? Who will protect our children from this despicable onslaught? Who did this to Nigeria?” Akintola added. Aired first on March 5 to June 4, 2006, the show has overtime generated widespread controversies. Moralists and religious leaders have called for its ban as it is seen to be promoting and showcasing “promiscuous lifestyle for fame and money.” A big version of the Big Brother reality show, Big Brother Africa which hosts 17 different African contestants, saw a Nigerian contestant, Ofunneka Anyanwu, got drunk and was sexually assaulted by a Tanzanian contestant Richard Bezuidenhout. Bezuidenhout sparked an outcry after he fondled, kissed and felt up the drunken Ofunneka, while his other love interest, the Angolan Tatiana Durao, was lying next to him. The producers sent paramedics into the house because Ofunneka and Durao were sobbing uncontrollably and vomiting after the incident. Bezuidenhout was locked in the diary room while viewers called for Bezuidenhout to be charged with sexual assault. Ofunneka confirmed that they drank “too much vodka” that day but she believes it was “not “rape”. In a recent happening during the 2018 edition of the BBNaija, the Tobacco Control Nigeria in 2018 also berated the show for its very disturbing trend has gone beyond the limits in offending the sensibilities of Nigerians who watch the series.” Although the federal government is yet react to any of the outcry, a Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Social Media, Lauretta Onochie, the government had no power to move against immoralities in the show as it was an adult programme. According to her, the show was not compulsory to watch. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
