Nigerian music star, Tuface Idibia has taken to his Twitter page to warn Nigerians about religions. The music legend in a series of tweets yesterday, July 4 warned Nigerians against practising scam ‘religion’ and looking upon men. His posts his coming on the heels of the rape allegation recently brought forward by Busola Dakolo, the wife of singer, Timi Dakolo. Dakolo in her allegation accused Biodun Fatoyinbo, the global senior pastor of Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA) of raping her twice as a teenager within four days. Since coming forward many Nigerians have been reacting to the story and Tuface in his post asked Nigerians to stay vigilant and stay away from scammers who come in the way of religion. Writing in pidgin English, Tuface wrote, “Any god wey say make you judge another person na scam.Any person wey say God tell am to tell you anything na scam. “Any god wey say make you kill person for am na scam.Any god wey say make you give another man money for am to bless you na scam “Any god wey say make you judge another person na scam.Any person wey say God tell am to tell you anything na scam “#ONELOVERELIGION but open your eyes.” Fatoyinbo who was accused in 2009 by a former female church member, Ese Walter of manipulating her into a sexual affair in his reaction to the latest allegation maintained his innocence although he decided to take a leave of absence from the pulpit. Fatoyinbo’s wife, Modele has also come forward to publicly throw her support being her husband by declaring that he is not capable of raping any woman. A protest was also held last Sunday by concerned members of the public who want to ensure that the case is seen to an end while Dakolo herself has filed a complaint against Fatoyinbo.
