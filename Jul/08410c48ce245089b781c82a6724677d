No fewer than 180,000 Christians across the world will, on Saturday, July 20, hold a non-denominational crusade, to pray for world peace. The crusade, which will attract worshippers from five continents, will hold at the Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS), Lagos. The promoter of the crusade, Rev. Mother Esther Abimbola Ajayi disclosed this, yesterday, at Julis, Northern District of Israel, where she gave scholarship to 30 students of higher institutions in that community. The renowned international evangelist and philanthropist, accompanied by her husband, Rev Ademuyiwa Ajayi, said the only thing that could bring peace to the world, especially Nigeria, was “prayer of the faithful.” She urged people to love themselves, irrespective of race or creed. Presenting cheques to the beneficiaries, Mother Ajayi said she got to know about the vulnerable in Julis through the Executive Director of Munir Foundation, Mr. Nadeem Ammar, when they met in London and he told her how General Munir Ammar died in a Plane Crash in 2006. Appreciating Mother Ajayi for her kind gesture to the people of Israel, Col. Moneeb Bader, said the community would remain eternally grateful to her for giving hope to the hopeless.
