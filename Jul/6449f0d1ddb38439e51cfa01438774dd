The  zonal publicity secretary (south west) of  Peoples  Democratic Party (PDP), Ayo Fadaka has blamed the loss of the party in the Osun governorship litigation at the Supreme Court on adherence to technicality. Fadaka in a statement yesterday said the PDP did its best to  ensure it reclaims its mandate in the September 2018  overnorship election saying its effort was fruitless due to legal technicality involved. ‘’Today (yesterday), the long journey to get justice in respect of the last gubernatorial election finally got to its terminal with the Supreme Court judgment which is said to be anchored on the technicality of the absence of Justice Obiorah at the sittings of February 6, 2019. The party and our candidate have no further choice than to abide with this ruling compulsorily. ‘’We will, however, remember that we were robbed in that election, the result of which President Muhammadu Buhari himself confirmed as being ‘remote controlled’ thus giving credence to the popular view that the
election was rigged. “We, however, congratulate our candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke, his family and entire party members in Osun State for pursuing their rights to the very end. Posterity will however judge as history has taken good notice of all those who played sinister role in Buhari’s ‘remote controlled’ victory of APC in Osun State.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
