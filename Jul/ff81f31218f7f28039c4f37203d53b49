Meanwhile, another club in District 9110, Rotary Club of Ajuwon, at the weekend held its tree planting project tagged ‘save the planet, plant a tree’ at Isokan Primary Healthcare Centre (PHC) in Ojokoro area of Lagos. President of the club, Rtn. Henry Akinbobola, said the exercise echoes the club’s desire of “transforming our communities into a cleaner, greener, healthier, and an environmentally-sustainable entity. We all know the effects of global warming and the constant rise in the temperature of the atmosphere around the world. Planting of trees is one of the ways to mitigate the effects of this global phenomenon. “Aside from creating a peaceful and aesthetically pleasing environment, they improve the quality of life by bringing natural elements and wildlife habitats into urban settings. I hereby appeal to everyone to imbibe the practice of planting a tree because of the many gains it plays in our daily existence.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
