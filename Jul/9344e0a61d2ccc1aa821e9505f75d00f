A wanted man, Stephen Murphy,  sends in a selfie after the police in Lincolnshire, England had posted his mugshot in order to track him. Murphy 33, a former model who claims to be better looking than David Beckham, was unhappy about the mugshot the police had run in the local newspaper in order to find out if anyone knew him. Murphy responded to the Lincolnshire Reporter that if they got his name and picture right, they would be able to find him. ‘And if you get my name right and don’t put the worst picture of me on, when I’ve been up for three days in Boston cop shop, you might be able to find me. Post this, it’s better for you.’  He said.
