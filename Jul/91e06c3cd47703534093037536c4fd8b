The chair of the Board of Trustees of the Unity School Old Students Association (USOSA), Mrs. Aisha Muhammed Oyebode, has lamented the worsening state of unity schools across the country, prompting many former old students to send their children and wards to schools outside the country. The old students also noted that for development at any level to occur in the country, there must be security, hence the state of security in the country should be given urgent attention. She made this known at the weekend while also appealing to President Muhammadu Buhari to consider looking to the alumnus body of any of the 104 unity schools in the country for the next Minister of Education. These formed parts of the communiqué issued after the 35th plenary of USOSA, which had as its theme ‘USOSA Resurgence: Harnessing our diversity for national security’, which held at Kings College annex, Victoria Island, Lagos, at the weekend. The communiqué, signed by Lawrence Anirejuoritse Wilbert (President-General) and Nasir Wasagu (Secretary-General) respectively, stated that, “USOSA as a community of graduates from the Federal Government secondary education institutions, that benefitted immensely from the unity school concept with demonstrable track records for consistent support and partnerships with the Federal Ministry of Education, calls on President Buhari to consider naming an ex-student of the unity schools as the next Minister of Education.” The body adds: “USOSA believes that it is now time for Nigeria to begin to reap from the huge strategic socioeconomic investment in generations of its citizens who have benefited from the excellent secondary education provided through the unity schools, as they represent some of the most competent persons in their fields across the globe”.
