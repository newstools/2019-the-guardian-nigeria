 [FILES] Osinbajo  He linked this anomaly to the poor delivery of basic education in the country, advocating a total reform. Osinbajo, who spoke at a symposium to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1979 Economics class of Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), in Lagos, said there is urgent need to reform the education sector at the basic level, adding that when there are better-trained teachers, the education sector would fair better. “It is evident that the quality of teachers is one of the most crucial things that can be done in the sector. Some of the countries that we have studied shows that anywhere there is high performing teachers, the quality of students is almost three times better than those with low performing teachers,” he said. Osinbajo noted that to address the situation, the Nigeria Certificate in Education (NCE) would be revamped to raise the caliber of new teachers. He also added that there would be continuous professional development for teachers, while teacher training at the NCE level would be linked to the revised curriculum.
