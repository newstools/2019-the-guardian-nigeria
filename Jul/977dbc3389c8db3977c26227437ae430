 Naira  The Joint National Public Service Negotiating Council (JNPSNC) and the eight unions in the public service were quoted on Monday as having directed their members to begin mobilisation for industrial action over what the unions perceived as Federal Government’s efforts at frustrating the implementation of the new national minimum wage. Chairman of JNPSNC, Anchaver Solomon, and the Secretary, Alade Lawal, stated that the council had begun mobilisation of its members nationwide for a showdown with the government. Adigun added that labour leaders in Ekiti were only awaiting final directive from the national body to begin strike.“We are still expecting directive from the national body to know the next line of action. But the signal we have got is that we should start mobilising members. When we get the directive, I will brief you properly. “We have met the who-is-who in the state and everybody has been assuring us that they would pay the minimum wage. But the issue is that every state is still waiting for the national minimum wage negotiating committee to provide the table. It is this table that will form what will be sent to the state. The state can either adopt it or commence negotiation. But minimum wage has become a law for all employers of over 50 workers to implement,” he said. The new minimum wage was passed into law early this year by the National Assembly and was assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari in April, which marked the commencement of the implementation.
