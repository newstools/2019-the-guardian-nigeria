Wizkid and Tiwa Savage have again joined forces in the multiple award-winning disc jockey, Sodamola Oluseye Desmond, popularly known as DJ Spinall latest body of work titled, Dis Love. The freshly mint single was released in the early hours of Thursday, July 25. DJ Spinall made the announcement on his Instagram page with pictures from what appears to be footage from the music video for the song. The new hit, which features the Nigerian music heavyweight  is coming off the DJ’s superb performance at Glastonbury Festival 2019, which held in Pilton, Sommeret, UK. The song, which visual has the directional imprint of Meji Alabi, is the Pepsi Ambassador’s first single since he released his fourth studio album, Iyanu. Produced by Spellz, the beatsmith behind Tiwa’s Ma Lo, the new offering finds Wizkid and Tiwa’s undeniable synergy very much intact, and leaves room for their vocals to take centre stage, with Wizkid, in particular, doing the major work. On the track, the duo sing about being in love, saying there’s nothing in the world that compares to what they’re feeling. They also make promises about their future together, saying they will do whatever is required to maintain their relationship. As expected a DJ, the Meji-Alabi directed clip is littered with all the trappings of the typical afropop music video, complemented with neon-soaked lighting, scantily-clad dancers and elaborate shows of wealth. In 2017, Wizkid and Tiwa Savage joined forces for the massively received hit, Ma Lo, which ended up being one of that year’s standouts and a follow up in the video for Wizkid’s 2018 gem, Fever. While Dis Love doesn’t hold a candle to their previous collaboration on “Ma Lo”— even though it tried to surpass their first team-up on the 2015 hit titled Bad, it’s still an expectedly fun track from the consistent DJ Spinall.
