Ace Nigerian comedian and social commentator, Ali Baba in an Instagram post have shared his thoughts on the type of ladies that should be considered the real slay queens. According to the laugh maestro, the real slay queens are not those who jump at an opportunity to go to Dubai, instead, they are the ones who ask “for what” when offered a free trip. To buttress his point, he shared a photo of a female mechanic and said hardworking women who are making efforts to be independent are the real slay queens, not the “lazy ones”. He shared the photo with the caption:  “Shout out to every woman out there who are legitimately activating their potentials. You are the real McCoy. You are the real slay queen.

Many men will fear to try some stunts with you. Because you have economic and a discerning mind. You are opinionated and independent.

While some lazy ones will jump at “Come with me to Dubai”… You will ask, “To do what?” Alibaba Alibaba who has been quite vocal about social criticism it would be recalled recently called out scammers and their supporters. He made his displeasure known in reaction to a post narrating how a struggling woman was scammed of her life savings by ATM fraudsters. Reacting to the post, he wrote, “Until it happens to you or someone you know… continue to support criminals. And the people who keep asking their spouses not to password their phones are also to blame. You now made your spouse remove password, when the phone is stolen, they simply go to Bank App… better pray they don’t transfer your house rent or kparapkor money. Nobody will believe you.”
