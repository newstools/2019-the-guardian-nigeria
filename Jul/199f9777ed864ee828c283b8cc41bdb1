Musa said at the team’s pre-match conference: “Though we had some issues, we came out and decided to play. We had to keep those issues aside so that we can concentrate on the next game. We sat down with ourselves and talked. We resolved we don’t need to make the issue a problem again in the camp. “We came out for our last game and told ourselves that we can do it. When the football federation is ready, they are ready. Now, we don’t have anything bothering us again as the camp is lively,” he said. Musa reflected on hbis past experience with Madagascar, who they met yesterday: “I think my first game for Eagles was against Madagascar and that was in Calabar (Cross River State) in 2010. I played against them; they are very a good side. But we will see who will carry the day,” he said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
