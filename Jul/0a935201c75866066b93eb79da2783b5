The United States accused Iran of “escalatory violence” on Friday after the country’s Revolutionary Guards announced they had confiscated a British tanker in the strategic Strait of Hormuz. Asked about the latest incident as he departed the White House, President Donald Trump told reporters there could be more than one tanker involved. “It could be one, it could be two,” Trump said. “We will talk to the UK. We’ll be working with the UK.” The Swedish owner of the UK-flagged tanker Stena Impero confirmed Friday the ship had been “attacked” and was heading towards Iran. CNN quoted an unnamed US official as saying Iran had seized a second tanker, the Liberian-flagged MV Mesdar. “The US will continue to work with our allies and partners to defend our security and interests against Iran’s malign behavior,” National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis said in a statement, denouncing “escalatory violence by the Iranian regime.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
