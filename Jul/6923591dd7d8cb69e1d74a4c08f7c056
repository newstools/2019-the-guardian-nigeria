His spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, confirmed the arrest on her Twitter account. Navalny’s arrest came after more than 22,000 people rallied in the Russian capital on Saturday to demand free and fair local polls, incensed by the authorities’ refusal to put popular opposition candidates on the ballot for the Moscow parliament elections in September. The opposition says it was the largest protest since 2012 when tens of thousands rallied against election fraud during parliamentary polls. Navalny threatened an even bigger rally this Saturday, near the mayor’s office, unless Moscow’s authorities register a new crop of popular politicians including Ilya Yashin and Lyubov Sobol within seven days.
