The Oba of Lagos, Oba Rilwan Akiolu, has said he is not the rubber stamp of former Lagos State governor, Bola Tinubu. Speaking yesterday during Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’ meeting with traditional rulers in the state, Akiolu said “Tinubu knows it that I am not a rubber stamp.” He added that the former governor does not reject his advice and requests. He further said he fears nobody except God that is why he would always speak his mind, besides speaking truth to power.He, however, told Sanwo-Olu and his deputy, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, not to accede to his request if he makes unworthy requests from them, while urging the governor and his deputy to be fast in listening to people’s advice, but be slow to respond. He said this is important because many who will come to advice them will be hypocrites who will give the world an account of the discussions they had when they came visiting. Akiolu further said the visit to the governor became necessary because all those elected and given leadership positions must be respected. He nonetheless said the visit was used to discusd germane issues on security and socio-economic development of the state.He promised that the kings and their chiefs would work with the governor to ensure that his administration is a success. The governor thanked the traditional rulers for coming and promised to foster a working relationship with the traditional institutions for Lagos to be a safe place and destination of choice for investment.Kings from the five divisions of Lagos were present including the Secretary to the State Government, Folashade Jaji and the Chief of Staff, Tayo Ayinde.
