 Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria. Photo/Nairametrics  During her investiture in Lagos at the weekend, the new chair explained that her administration would leverage on investment in agriculture to encourage youths to be employers of labour. She promised to use ICAN platforms to support the diversification of the country’s economy through agriculture. “We have an entrepreneurial committee that is ready to support people with entrepreneurial ideas financially and recommend to banks, especially IBTC, to support their ideas. Right now, we are ready to support them. “If you are not an employee, you should be an employer. What we tell our members is, don’t look at who will employ you; look at how you can be an entrepreneur. “Entrepreneurship covers many areas of the economy. We encourage our members to go into farming and transportation. Accounting is very versatile and there is no area of life that accountants cannot venture into,” she said. The immediate past chairman, Tunde Kuti, encouraged young accountants to embrace financial independence rather than focusing on salaries from a paid job. He explained that ICAN established the Entrepreneurship Faculty at headquarters in Victoria Island, Lagos, with committee ready to build business ideas with financial support (interest-free loan) from IBTC. “Our vision is for our members to be self-employed accountants at the end of the day. We have platforms to encourage young ones to go into entrepreneurship,” he said. Reacting to the problems faced by Nigerian farmers, the first deputy vice president of ICAN, Mrs. Comfort Eyitayo, stated that bad roads had claimed about 70 percent of farm produce in Nigeria. She called on President Muhammadu Buhari to invest more in infrastructure to enhance the transportation of farm produce from the farms to the markets.
