Nausea is stomach discomfort and the sensation of wanting to vomit. Nausea can be a precursor to vomiting the contents of the stomach. The condition has many causes and can often be prevented. Nausea is a very nonspecific symptom that can occur with a great many number of diseases and conditions. Nausea can occur due to pain, infections (like influenza or viral gastroenteritis), migraine, inner ear disease, motion sickness, food poisoning, or emotional stress. Some of the other conditions associated with nausea are heart attack, gallbladder attack, intestinal obstruction, meningitis, and pancreatitis. Nausea is also a common symptom of early pregnancy and it also occurs as a side effect of some medications. Here are a few natural ways to handle nausea; 1.	Ginger
Ginger is a popular natural remedy commonly used to treat nausea. Experts believe that compounds in ginger may work in a similar way to anti-nausea medications.
Ginger use is safe for most people. However, you may need to limit your ginger intake if you’re prone to low blood pressure or low blood sugar, or if you’re taking blood thinners. 2.	Lemon
The scent of citrus such as that from a freshly sliced lemon, may help reduce nausea in pregnant women. Slicing a lemon or simply scratching its peel may work in a similar way because it helps release its essential oils into the air. 3.	Control Your Breathing 
Taking slow, deep breaths can also help reduce nausea. Breathing in slowly through the nose and exhale through the mouth three times helps to decrease nausea especially while exposed to various scents. 4.	Relax Your Muscles
Relaxing your muscles may help relieve nausea. Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) is a relaxation technique people have used to achieve this effect.
