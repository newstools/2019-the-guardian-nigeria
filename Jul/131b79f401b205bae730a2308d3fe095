The Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege has expressed dismay over the insistence of some multinational oil companies operating in the Niger Delta region on relocating their headquarters elsewhere. The oil companies whose head offices are not in the region, he said, should relocate there. “I am from the Niger Delta and there are a lot of us who believe that most of the oil companies are doing business in that neighbourhood ought to have their offices and their headquarters in that same neighbourhood so as to provide employment opportunities,” Omo-Agege said on Tuesday during the screening of ministerial nominees. “There is an issue that is raging right now in the Niger Delta and it has to do with the Nigerian Gas Company in Ekpan-Warri; they are also threatening to move their headquarters from Warri in Delta state to elsewhere. “I am seeking a commitment today as the representative of the people of Delta Central that no ministerial nominee today will eventually superintend over the movement of Nigerian Gas Company elsewhere. “I also seek a commitment that those companies that are doing business in the Niger Delta but have their headquarters elsewhere should come back to the Niger Delta area to provide jobs for our teeming youths,” the Deputy President of the Senate said.
