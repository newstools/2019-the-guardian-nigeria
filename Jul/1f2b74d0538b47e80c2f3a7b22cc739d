After a seemingly never ending 11 week long trial, notorious drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán has been sentenced to life in prison, plus 30 years. The news comes from a spokesperson for U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue for the Eastern District of New York, who added that El Chapo has also been ordered to pay $12.6 billion in forfeiture. The sentence was handed down by U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan on Wednesday. Shortly after news of his lengthy sentence broke out, social media began buzzing with mixed reactions and thoughts about his impending prison time.           El Chapo would be serving his sentence at a Florence, Colorado “supermax” prison as he has twice escaped from max-security facilities in Mexico.
