Using her spare time in the university where she bagged a degree in Law, Biwom recorded her first single, participated in a handful of music competitions and gained a reasonable degree of recognition. In the last quarter of 2018, she released a single titled Faya and has now followed up with the just-released Krizbeatz-produced pop ballad dubbed G-Wagon.
