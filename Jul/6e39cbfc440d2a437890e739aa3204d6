According to his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, the governor made the promises during an on-the-spot assessment of the medical facility. The governor also asked the management and staff of the hospital to join the government in restoring the glory of the hospital. “If we do the right thing in this hospital, it can become the medical tourist destination for the country. If we perform very well, we will let the whole world know what we are doing here. So, I want you to walk with us on the journey to reposition this hospital to have its glory back. I know it is possible and doable,” he reportedly said. Makinde noted the huge gap between what he expected and what he met in the hospital, adding, however, that the problem was not the capacity of the staff but unavailability of equipment. He said: “Health is one of the pillars that this administration wants to focus on and we believe that if we have a healthy population, we will have more productivity.” Promising to support the hospital, he added: “We will come back to you with the specific agenda on how to develop this hospital and make it an institution that can attract patients from all over the country apart from taking care of our immediate environment.” In his remarks, the chief consultant of the hospital, Dr. Femi Adesanya, appreciated the governor and his entourage for the visit, promising to support the government’s vision to turn around the fortunes of the hospital and improve the health sector.
