 Soccer Football – Bundesliga – Bayern Munich v Borussia Dortmund – Allianz Arena, Munich, Germany – April 6, 2019  Borussia Dortmund’s Abdou Diallo     REUTERS/Andreas Gebert  DFL regulations prohibit any use of photographs as image sequences and/or quasi-video  Diallo, 23, was absent from the Dortmund squad who set off earlier Monday for a pre-season US tour and is expected to take a medical prior to signing a five-year deal for the French champions, Kicker said. An automatic choice for the German club last season with 28 Bundesliga matches and seven Champions League appearances, the France under-21 international would have more trouble establishing himself at PSG if the move goes through. With Diallo, coach Thomas Tuchel would dispose of an embarrassment of riches in central defence with Thiago Silva, Marquinhos, and Presnel Kimpembe competing with him for the central defender roles.
