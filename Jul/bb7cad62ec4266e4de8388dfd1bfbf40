Senator Oluremi Tinubu Monday requested for employment slots for members of her constituency from Babatunde Raji Fashola during his ministerial screening at the Senate. “Remember in your first tenure, I did not get the opportunity to get some of my constituents employed,” Remi Tinubu told Fashola, who served as power, works and housing minister during President Muhammadu Buhari’s first term. “When you get there this time around, remember that we senators have our constituents who ask us for employment.” She asked Fashola to include employment for members of her constituency in his agenda after confirmation as a minister. “We all need slots for employment for our constituents,” Tinubu said. Tinubu and other lawmakers quizzed Fashola on his achievements at the three ministeries oversaw from 2015 till 2019. Fashola’s two-hour of answering the Senators marked the resumption of the ministerial nominees screening by the Nigerian Senate. Nigerian Senate had screened 31 out of the 43 persons nominated for ministerial appointments by President Muhammadu Buhari. The Senate commenced the screening on Tuesday, July 24. The nominees scheduled for the screening on Monday included Geoffrey Onyema (Enugu State), Maryam Katagum (Bauchi State), Clement Agba (Edo) and Suleiman Adamu (Jigawa State). Others are Goddy Jeddy-Agba (Cross River), Rauf Aregbesola (Osun), Sen. Gbemisola Saraki (Kwara), Dr. Muhammadu Mahmoud (Kaduna State) and Babatunde Fashola (Lagos State). Senate president Ahmad Lawan said Sabo Nanunu (Kano State), Saleh Mamman (Taraba) and Lai Mohammed (Kwara) will be screened on Tuesday.
