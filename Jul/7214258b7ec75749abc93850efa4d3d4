Dr. Richard Somiari, a forensic scientist and prosecution witness in the ongoing trial of a Danish national, Peter Nielsen, who is accused of killing his Nigerian wife and daughter has revealed to the Lagos State High Court, Igbosere that his expertise in Crime Scene Processing was actually acquired through a 16-hour online course.
  
He told Justice Mobolanle Okikiolu-Ighile that he did not actually physically attend Florida International University, USA to study Crime Scene Processing but was certified and became an expert after completing a 16-hour programme online from the school.
  
Somiari said this while being cross examined by Nielsen’s lead counsel, Olasupo Shasore (SAN). Nielsen was arraigned on June 13, 2018 on a two-count murder charge, in accordance with Section 223 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. He was alleged to have murdered his Nigerian singer wife, Zainab alongside his three-and-half-year-old daughter, Petra, but pleaded not guilty, following which the judge ordered his remand for trial. 
  
The witness also revealed that not all the evidential samples taken at the crime scene were tested at the laboratory. He disclosed that over 50 evidential samples were taken at the crime scene but not all were tested. He stated that after some of the samples taken at the scene were tested, they discovered that some of the biological materials found on the nightwear of the murdered woman and her child matched that of Nielsen, the crime suspect.
