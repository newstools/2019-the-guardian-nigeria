The Nigerian government Tuesday denied it has sent names of ministerial nominees to the country’s Senate for approval. President Muhammadu Buhari was sworn in over a month ago and it was believed that he would send names of nominees to the Senate after the lawmakers resumed from a two-week break. But a Nigerian spokesman denied media reports that the names of the nominees have been sent. “I have no breaking news on the appointment of ministers because I have not been briefed about it,” Presidential spokesman Garba Shehu said in a Facebook post. “My Twitter account is a verified one. Whoever wants to know what I have said should go to it, not to a fake one. Ignore the report they are attributing to me, please.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
