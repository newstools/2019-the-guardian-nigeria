Piqued at the rate of unemployment in the country, the Canadian Government through the Global Affairs Canada (GAC), has provided about $15million (Canadian Dollar) or N4.1billion to support for about 10,000 youths in Cross River State. The five-year project implemented by Cusco International, is aimed at addressing the high unemployment rate of about 40 per cent, assist youths in the state to acquire skills in agricultural value chain ranging from Fisheries, Cassava, Poultry, among others. GAC Senior Programme Officer, Sophie Price, said the Project, Youth Leadership Entrepreneurship Access and Development (YOULead), comes at a time the rate of unemployment in the state is affecting their economic well being. The Country Representative of Cusco International Ebrima Sonko, said: “We thought of a problem that would look at youth employment within the natural resource sectors address the problem of Cross River State. More than 10,000 youths were trained in entrepreneurship of which about 3,500 have been engaged in different agricultural value chain business. “We are willing to support GAC to scale up the programme to other state. We have been able to demonstrate that supporting youths has a way of bringing back to the society some positive development.” The five-year programme, which was expected to end in March, was extended for another six months by the donor to December, to effectively close the project.
