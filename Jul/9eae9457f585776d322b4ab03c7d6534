Palpable fear yesterday gripped the people of Ondo State as indigenes of Okitipupa and Odigbo local government areas engaged in free-for-all attack over land ownership, resulting in two deaths, with many others seriously injured. The Guardian gathered that the Ikale people in Okitipupa had been in an age-long dispute with their neighbours in Araromi-Obu community of Odigbo. Recently, there was a court ruling in favour of the Ikale community as the rightful owner of the land though the ruling was appealed. It was learnt that the Ikale people invaded Araromi Obu in the early hours of yesterday, preventing the people of the area, who are mainly farmers, from going to farm and taking ownership of the land. A source, who spoke with our correspondent on terms of anonymity, revealed that no fewer than six people were seriously injured in the crisis as some houses were set on fire and two persons reportedly dead. While speaking on behalf of the chairman of Araromi Obu Development Committee, Mr. Bisoye Monebi, condemned the invasion by the Ikales, saying the people carted away farm produce and dispossessed people of their farms. According to him, the tragic incident nearly resulted into internecine war, “but for the maturity of the community heads, necessitating the intervention of the state police command.” The state Police Public Relations Officers (PPRO), Mr. Femi Joseph, who confirmed the development, said mobile policemen had been drafted to the community to restore peace in the area.
