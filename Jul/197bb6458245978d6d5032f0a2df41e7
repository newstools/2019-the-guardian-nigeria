The Lion King premiere which held on Sunday, July 14 had in attendance two power couples – Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle – who enjoyed a brief hello. Dressed in a beautiful gold gown, Beyoncé was beaming as she and Jay-Z chatted up the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who had a date night out (without baby Archie) for the European debut of the re-imagined Disney classic at London’s Odeon Luxe Leicester Square. The leading lady embraced both Harry and Meghan, who matched in sleek black ensembles — he in a timeless tux, she in a sheer-sleeved, tea-length cocktail dress. See photos below:
