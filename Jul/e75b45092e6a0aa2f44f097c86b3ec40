Former international, Dimeji Lawal believes the Super Eagles are beginning to play the way great Nigerian teams of old were known for, adding, however, that there are still lapses in the team’s defence. Lawal said the Super Eagles showed commitment and hunger in the match against Cameron on Saturday, adding that the team would go far in the ongoing African Cup of Nations if they continued in that spirit. Congratulating the Eagles for coming all out to book the quarterfinal, he advised the players against seeing Cameroon as the only big treat in the championship, saying they still have to work hard to excel in their next game. Among other shortcomings, Lawal said the Super Eagles have to work more to play as a team, adding that the technical crew to must sort out the defence to align with the other parts of the team.
The ex footballer also called on football loving Nigerians to keep encouraging the players as they forge ahead to claim the AFCON title. “The Super Eagles’ victory against Cameroon has helped to instill more confidence in the team. “The Eagles made some mistakes that would have made them lose the match, especially in the defence. So the coach needs to work hard on the backline. “They should also understand that Cameroon is not the only big team at the AFCON. Tougher matches are still on the line, so they should not allow the victory over Cameroon get into their heads,” he said.
