 Pastor Enoch Adejare Adeboye  The demand is coming two days after the cleric weighed in on the raging debate over the sexual immoralities being perpetrated by men of God in the light of the scandal that has engulfed the Senior Pastor of the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly, Biodun Fatoyinbo, who was forced to step aside following several allegations of rape. The protesters in their hundreds, included maverick entertainer and activist, Charles Oputa, popularly called Charly Boy, Michael Parish, Idris Abdulkareem, Baba Fryo and a couple of other upcoming artistes. They marched through the camp, carrying placards with inscriptions such as: “Adeboye, speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves”, “Adeboye, would you have kept quiet if Leah was your biological daughter”, among others. Chairman and convener of the group, Felix Duke, said the protest was to demand Adeboye’s intervention in addressing insecurity issues bedeviling the nation. Duke said the group chose Adeboye because the RCCG has the largest Christian followership in Nigeria and Africa. Duke said many Christians and non – Christians placed the spiritual leader of the church in high esteem and looked up to him. Charly Boy expressed disappointment that notable Nigerians, especially respected spiritual fathers, were silent about the onslaught and killings within the country. In a video shared on his Instagram page, Abdulkareem said, “I’m here with Baba Fryo, I’m here with Felix Duke and we are here to say ‘Baba speak up’. You have talked about COZA, now, we want you to talk about RUGA.”	Addressing the group, Pastor Joshua Obayemi, National Overseer, RCCG, lauded the initiative of the group to speak for the voiceless. He commended their struggle for the masses and promised to deliver the message of the group to Pastor Adeboye.
