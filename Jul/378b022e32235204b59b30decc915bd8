Some members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) Tuesday broke into the National Assembly complex premises resulting in a fierce encounter with security operatives. The Shiâ€™ites are protesting against the continued detention of their leader Ibrahim Elzakzaky. They broke down the first gate and proceeded to the second, which serves as the main entrance to the complex. However, security operatives on ground repelled the protest with gunshots fired into the air to disperse the protesters. The incident has since created pandemonium within and around the assembly complex. Several witnesses, who recounted the face-off, said the incident occurred when the protesters tried to force their way into the assembly complex. Details later.
