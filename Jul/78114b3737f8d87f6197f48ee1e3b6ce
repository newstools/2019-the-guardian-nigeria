Last Kings rapper Tyga recently released a visual and musical tribute to his mentor and former boss Lil Wayne where he replicated some of Tunechi’s most famous music videos in his own video for the track “Lightskin Lil Wayne.” Shortly after Tyga dropped the video, Lil Wayne took to Instagram to show appreciation. “Love!!!!!! That’s too dope bro,” Wayne wrote. “I’m at a lost for words after watching & listening to that! It feels gratifying to be honored in such a way! It feels uber better when it’s from ya broski!! Love @tyga – Light Skinned Tunechi!”   A TRIBUTE TO THE   LIGHTSKIN LIL WAYNE VIDEO LINK UP TOP A post shared by  T-Raww (@tyga) on Jul 8, 2019 at 7:08am PDT  Tyga’s video spanned Lil Wayne’s long career by mimicking the videos released throughout his prime, including “A Milli,” “Lollipop,” and “Fireman.” Similar to how “A Milli” served as the introduction to Lil Wayne’s “Got Money,” Tyga uses “Lightskin Lil Wayne” to set the stage for the visual to his single, “Too Many.” The second part is majorly inspired by “Fireman.” Like Wayne, Tyga climbs on to a fire engine to rap the song’s lyrics in a dimly lit parking lot. His wardrobe also mirrors Wayne’s A Bathing Ape-centric fashion style.
