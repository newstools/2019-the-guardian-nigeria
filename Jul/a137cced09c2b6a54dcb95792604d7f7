 [FILES] Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE)  Similarly, all other indices finished higher with the exception of the NSE Premium, NSE Insurance, NSE-AFR Bank Value and three others. Analysts, at the weekend, linked the recovery to market forces, as players and bargain hunters took advantage of the persistent low valuation of listed equities to reposition their portfolios for second quarter (Q2) earnings reporting season. They also argued that the market expects the announcement of the government’s new cabinet, economic team and a blueprint from the fiscal authority to kick off implementation of the 2019 budget. According to them, discerning investors are taking advantage of low valuation to position ahead of March year-end numbers and second half interim dividend stocks. Specifically, the Chief Research Officer of Investdata Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omodion, said: “We expect the mixed performance as the end of quarter window dressing by fund managers, portfolio repositioning and balancing for month end and the Q2 earnings reporting season continue. “Bargain hunters are likely to hit the market any moment from now, while discerning investors are taking advantage of low valuation to position ahead of March year-end numbers and second half interim dividend stocks. “They may also take into consideration the expected economic reforms as government announces its much-awaited new cabinet, just as plans by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to reduce banks’ participation in government securities is expected to boost private sector lending to drive economic activities and investment.” Analysts at Codros Capital Limited said: “Following bargain hunting across bellwether stocks like Guaranty Trust Bank, Nestle and Nigerian Breweries, the Nigerian equities market halted its three-week losing streak, as the benchmark index increased by 0.39 per cent w/w to settle at 29,966.87 points. Our outlook for equities in the short to medium term remains conservative amid the absence of a positive catalyst.” Further breakdown of last week’s transactions showed that a total turnover of 1.77 billion shares worth N28.036 billion was recorded in 18,660 deals by investors on NSE, lower than a total of 7.476 billion units valued at N91.107 billion that was exchanged in 17,192 deals during the preceding week.
