A mom-governmental organisation, RARDUJA International, has organised a workshop for nurses in Imo State on the dangers of illegal migration. Founder of the NGO, Dr. Endy Duru, represented by the National Coordinator, Andy Duru, told newsmen at the weekend in Owerri that the event was part of efforts to drive home the message against unplanned trips by Nigerians to foreign nations. He noted that Nigerian nurses fall in the group of persons that strongly believes that life is rosier overseas and “have traveled without having the necessary information about the reality on the ground.” Duru maintained that most of the nurses who jetted out ended up roaming the streets of Europe frustrated, leaving them with no option but to engage in social vices like prostitution and the likes. He added that they were disposed to educating medical practitioners desirous of traveling abroad on how to secure legal jobs and lead a meaningful life over there.
