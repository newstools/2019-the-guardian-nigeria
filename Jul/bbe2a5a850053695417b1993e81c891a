Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has said that the state would not give even an inch of its land under any guise for herdsmen to graze their cattle. Wike said Rivers people have rejected any settlement scheme for herdsmen in the state because their lands cannot be used for such ventures. The governor made the position of the state on the matter known when the founder and President of Throne-Room Trust Ministries, Apostle Nuhu Kure, visited him at the Government House, Port Harcourt, yesterday. “Like I said, Rivers State will not participate in any settlement programme for herdsmen by whatever name it is called. I speak as the governor of Rivers State. “If they want water for the cattle, they can lay pipes from the Bonny ocean to the far north.  That is what we can contribute.  We don’t have lands for any settlement scheme.  Our land is for commercial agriculture,” he said. Wike said God loves Nigeria, stating that if not, there would have been no Nigeria today due to the inherent contradiction of the country.  He stressed that Nigeria needs God’s serious intervention, saying it was imperative for men of God to continue to pray for the country. Apostle Kure, in his remarks, charged the Federal Government to immediately arrest the northern youths who gave other Nigerians ultimatum over the suspension of the Ruga settlement programme. “I want to use this opportunity to say that whatever is coming from those youths in the north is not a representation of the north. I want to take advantage of my visit to appeal to the Federal Government through you that people who are going to this extreme should be arrested. If government cannot call these people to order, it means we have a lawless society.  It means we don’t have a government,” he said.
