 UNIBEN  Imaghodora, a final year student of the Department of Actuarial Science, was said to be battling some academic issues at the time of his death. Public Relations Officer (PRO) of UNIBEN, Michael Osasuyi, in a chat with newsmen yesterday said: “It is unfortunate that something like this has happened in the university. We feel so pained to hear the news that a student fell from the second floor of the faculty building. “The parents have been informed and the university is trying to unravel the mystery behind the incident and ascertain if it was actually a suicide attempt. There are many accounts of the incident, but the university, with the help of the police, will find out what actually happened. “The school has frowned on suicide attempt by students. No condition is worth committing suicide. Information reaching us was that the student had two carry-over papers to write. He was supposed to write one on a fateful day (of the incident). It may not be the issue of carry-over because they are many spillover students too,’’ Osasuyi said. He assured the public that the police would investigate thoroughly, with a view to unraveling the cause of Imaghodora’s death. The PRO advised students to always seek help by visiting the university’s counseling unit, because there is always a solution to every problem. He also advised parents and guardians to always give a listening ear to their children and wards who might be needing direction and a confidante when faced with difficult situations. It would be recalled that last month, a 21-year-old student of the university, Christabel Buoro, also committed suicide, allegedly over failed love affair.
