 NDDC  In a communique issued at the end of the meeting of the group for the second quarter of the year in Akure, signed by the chairman, Mr. Segun Abayomi, the communities said that Ondo State had been marginalised for so long. AOPC, a group of oil producing communities in the state, said that Ondo State people were not allowed to enjoy the topmost leadership rung of the commission, causing some noticeable problems in the mandate areas. “Ondo State is No. 5 on the list of oil producing states. Despite the fact that we are legally entitled to the position, only four states have been holding the position of the chairman and managing director as against the content of the NDDC Act. “Ondo South has been cut off from the national grid. Efforts made to restore light though commended, has not yielded the desired result. We use this medium to call on President Buhari to consider Ondo State in the constitution of the board of NDDC,” it said. The group, which lauded Buhari for being a man of justice and fairness, urging him to use his good office to correct the alleged injustice that characterised the rotation since creation, said: “We are confident that justice will be done. We commend the President for his concern on the development of the Niger Delta. We call on the President not to relent. “We also advise that he takes the stock of his development efforts in the Niger Delta areas with a view to ascertaining the development needs of the area.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
