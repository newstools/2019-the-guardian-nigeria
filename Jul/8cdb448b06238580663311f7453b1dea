British-Nigerian artiste Dave has recently released follow up visuals to his highly acclaimed track ‘Location’ which features Burna Boy. The track is a standout from the rappers’s critically-acclaimed debut album Psychodrama, which dropped in March.
Dave is in full celebration mode in the self-directed music video, which features apppearances from Stormzy, Michael Dapaah and J Hus. Burna Boy gives an energetic performance, joining Dave and a group of friends at a well-lit outdoor party. The video brings to life a tweet that Dave shared earlier this year, upon the release of his album. The tweet is also the opening clip of the music video. “Picture the scenes,” he wrote. “You’re drunk in Ibiza. It’s merky festival and you’ve had a couple cocktails, Hus is free, location is playing, Girls are smiling at you. What a 2019.” Dave took to Instagram to announce the release of the video with a caption that read;
