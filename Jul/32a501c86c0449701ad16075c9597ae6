Brandy proves she is still in the game as she teams up with Daniel Caesar for a lush ballad “Love Again” released on Friday, July 5. Love Again which was produced by Jordan Evans and Matthew Burnett appears on Caesar’s just-released album Case Study 01 and it perfectly melds Brandy’s signature breathy, sultry vocals and Caesar’s soulful singing. According to a press release announcing the song, Brandy is in the studio working on her upcoming album, due out on Brand Nu Entertainment/Entertainment One, with new music expected to drop this summer. “I’m very excited to return with new music, and to release this single with Daniel,” said Brandy in a statement. “I’m working on my new album, and can’t wait to release it later this year. I’m thankful for God’s blessings and for the support of my fans!” Brandy is slated to take the state on Friday night at the Essence Festival in New Orleans. Listen to “Love Again” below.
