 Abubakar Bello of Niger State.  Lawan spoke in Minna yesterday at the reception and unveiling of Strategic Senatorial Action Plan of representative of Niger East Senatorial District, Alhaji Sani Musa. He said, “At the Senate, we came under different political platforms, but we have overcome party differences and it is now time to move on and make Nigeria a better place for all.” Speaking, Musa promised to make education his top priority, saying that there could not be dedicated youths without quality education. He pointed out that educating the people of his constituency would be his top priority, because “fixing our schools is as good as fixing the future of our youths.” However, Lawan who was reacting to APC anthem sang by the state party Chairman, Jibrin Iman, said he did not expect him (Iman) not to sing APC anthem “because you are the party Chairman, but at the Senate we see ourselves as senators of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “There are no PDP senators or APC senators. We have achieved a great deal of peace because we see ourselves as brothers and sisters regardless of party affiliations and we are ready to work for Nigeria’s common good. “We are united on the need to have the country’s security situation improved, to have our roads fixed and pay greater attention to other infrastructure to make lives better for Nigerians.” Also speaking, Bello charged Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) senators on the need to cooperate with their APC counterparts for the overall interest of the country. “We must put party differences behind us now to move the country forward. You are senators of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and not senators of APC or PDP, this is very important,” he added. He reminded Lawan that for him to succeed, he needed the cooperation of all senators regardless of their party differences.
