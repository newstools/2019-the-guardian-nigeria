A court of Appeal sitting in Kaduna Monday granted the application of governorship candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kano, Abba Kabiru Yusuf, to amend its witness list with additional eight-star witnesses in his case against Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje. Justice Adedotun Adefoke-Okoji, while delivering judgement on the appeal filed by the appellant, granted all the prayers of the petitioner. She insisted that the inclusion of witnesses name which already indicated in the deposition does not amount to amendments of the original petition. Justice Halima S. Mohammed of the Kano state governorship election petition tribunal on 16th July ruled against the PDP’s application to add eight-star witnesses on its witness list. Yusuf’s counsel, Chief Adegboyega Awomolo, had sought the leave of the five panel Justices of the Appeal court to quash the ruling of the lower court. Meanwhile, Ganduje has filed a fresh notice of appeal against the judgement to the supreme court. Ganduje’s legal team research leader, Musa Lawan, said the Governor has instructed immediate appeal to the latest judgement of the Appeal court.
