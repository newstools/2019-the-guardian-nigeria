The recent call for relocation of tanks farms in Ibasa/Ijegun area of Satellite Town, Oriade Local Council Development Area of Lagos State by the Community Development Association (CDA) has been opposed by indigenes of the area.
 
The CDA chaired by Mr. Michael Imitimi, had recently said the demands by the association for the relocation of farms tanks from the community were based on the dangerous and chaotic nature of their operations, which are detrimental to safety in the community. However, the indigenes of the community have said the call for the relocation of the tank farms by the CDA was not in the interest of the community but for personal reasons.
 
The youth league of the community-led by Taofeeq Rasak Odunewu, Seliu Kazeem and S.O. Wakili, chairman, vice chairman and secretary respectively, described the CDA as tenants in the community, adding that they did not deliberate with them and other stakeholders before making the call.
 
“We would like to state that those who protested against the presence of tank farms in our community are unknown to us and are not indigenes of this community. By that, they cannot claim to be representing our interest but their own selfish interest. Consequently, we reject the protest in all its entirety and regard it as a breach of the public peace and a calculated attempt by those group to cause face-off within the community.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
