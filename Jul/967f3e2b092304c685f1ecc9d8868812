Senator Elisha Abbo was yesterday arraigned before a Magistratesâ€™ Court in Zuba, Abuja, on an assault charge by the Nigerian Police Force (NPF).
The lawmaker pleaded not guilty when the one count charge was read to him. After his plea was taken at the dock by Senior Magistrate Abdullahi llellah, he was granted bail to the tune of N5 million. The police had filed criminal charges against Abbo for assaulting a woman at an adult sex toy shop in Abuja after a video of the incident went viral last week. The development follows the admittance of wrongdoing in a public apology by the Senator, which the police said would be admitted in court to argue its case. Besides the evidence from the video, which showed Senator Abbo repeatedly hitting the woman on the face for her intervention in an argument between him and the shop attendant, it was gathered that police detectives had established a prima-facie case against the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) lawmaker representing Adamawa North Senatorial District in the National Assembly.
