There was a mild drama Monday morning at the Nigerian Customs Headquarters, Abuja, as the ASC1 ranked officer from Katsina state, promoted himself to the rank of Deputy Comptroller General and then invaded the office of the CGC to take over as the new boss. He allegedly claimed to be carrying out a presidential order. He has since been arrested. The Customs Public Relations Officer, Deputy Comptroller, Joseph Attah confirmed the incident to The Guardian, but said the officer involved is “not in the right frame of mind” and has since been taken for medical examination. “What happened was that, an Assistant Superintendent of Customs came to the office today wearing the rank of a Deputy Comptroller General,” Attah said. “From questions and answers that followed, it was obvious that he was not in the right frame of mind, so a Doctor was immediately invited. “He is presently under going medical examination at the medical unit of the service,” he said.
