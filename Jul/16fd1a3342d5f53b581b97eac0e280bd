 [FILE] Cross River State governor Professor Ben Ayade  Major roads in the state – including Botanical Garden Road, Target Road, Mary SlessorAvenue, IBB Way etc. – will be locked down between 7 am and 4 pm for the tree planting. “The holiday is to encourage every Cross Riverian and residents to take part in the Green Carnival during which about one million trees will be planted,” Christian Ita, the chief press secretary to the state governor, said in a statement on Monday. “Individuals, schools, homes, churches, mosques, ministries, government agencies and departments, banks, hospitals and all business premises must ensure that they plant trees.” Cross River State Governor Ben Ayade last Wednesday declared July 30, a public holiday. Ayade, in a statement signed by Ita said the tree-planting drive “underscores our readiness for the REDD+ and commitment to forest conservation and management.” “REDD+ is Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, plus the sustainable management of forests, and the conservation and enhancement of forest carbon stocks.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
