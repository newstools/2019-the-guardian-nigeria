Great pressure has been exerted over the last two years to find him!” Trump tweeted. The arrest came days before Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan is due to meet Trump at the White House.

The top US diplomat for South Asia called for Pakistan to ensure the prosecution of Saeed, who has spent years in and out of varying forms of detention. “A full and expeditious prosecution for his involvement in numerous acts of terror, such as the Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people, including six Americans, is necessary,” said Alice Wells, the acting assistant secretary of state for South Asia. “The victims of terrorist attacks deserve justice,” she wrote on Twitter.
