 Federal High Court, Lagos yesterday ordered that a plot of land in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, allegedly belonging to a former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Mrs. Diezani Alison-Madueke, be forfeited to FG  Justice Chuka Obiozor made the forfeiture order following an application by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The anti-graft agency had told the judge that the land, measuring 7,903.71 to 8,029.585 square metres and designated as Plot 9, Azikiwe Road, Old GRA (UAC Property on Forces Avenue), Port Harcourt, was reasonably suspected to part of proceeds of unlawful activities. The commission prayed the court for an order to allow it “to appoint a competent person or firm to manage the asset/property.” It urged the court to prohibit “any disposal, conveyance, mortgage, lease, sale or alienation or otherwise of the asset/property.” Counsel to the EFCC, Ebuka Okongwu, argued that the judge had the power, pursuant to Section 17 of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Related Offences Act 2006, to make the forfeiture order. After listening to him, Justice Obiozor granted the forfeiture order as prayed. Only last Friday, the same court ordered the forfeiture of 2,149 pieces of jewelry and a customised gold iPhone, valued at $40 million, belonging to the ex-minister.
