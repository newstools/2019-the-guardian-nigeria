Herrera was part of the United squad that knocked PSG out of the Champions League in the round of 16 last season. Asked what he had learned from that encounter, the Spaniard pointed out that PSG were without the injured Neymar and Edinson Cavani but won 2-0 at Old Trafford in the first leg playing “extraordinary” football. He carefully avoided the subject of PSG’s second-leg display as they lost 3-1 at home, by saying “I don’t want to talk about the past again”. “You know in Europe, there are eight to 10 clubs who want to win it: Juventus, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester City, Liverpool, Tottenham, Munich,” he said. “But only one can do it. I think we have to continue to be the strongest team in France.” Herrera said he was impressed by the potential at PSG. “We have incredible players! I will also be there to help them improve, and make them better players.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
