Members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Anambra State have decried their exclusion from the scheme of things in the country, saying the party should immediately make amends or be ready have no members in the state. The members spoke at the interactive Roundtable meeting with Vice President Yemi Osibanjo in Awka, yesterday. A former member of the Federal House of Representatives, Chief Fort Dike, who represented Ihiala, threw the first salvos. “Our members are hungry, angry and ashamed at the way we are being treated in Anambra State as members of APC. This is the first time since I joined politics in 1979 that members of the ruling party would be so relegated. Party democracy is never run by gangs, cliques or cabals,” he declared. Dike pointed out that APC members in the state were all in pains despite the fact the party controls the Federal Government.
Chief Olisa Onyeka, a member of the party’s Board of Trustees, in his remarks, called for 400 board appointments for members of the party in the state. He stated that Anambra has 326 electoral wards, stressing that if each ward gets one slot, it would go a long way to buoy the electoral fortunes of the party in the state and even help it to win the next governorship poll. He lamented that the manner the party was being administered had rendered it a regional party. “The way the party and the Federal Government’s affairs are being run has rendered APC a regional party. We have been so sidelined in the scheme of things that it is really in doubt whether any of the leaders is thinking of how to shore up the party in the state and zone,” he said. He described the situation as ugly, urging national leadership to improve on the welfare of her members in the state or they would desert the party.
