American rapper, singer, and songwriter Lil Nas X rose to stardom with the release of his country infused hip hop track “Old Town Road” and now he’s made history with it. His unprecedented success has seen him climb to the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and maintain his position for 13 consecutive weeks. This makes “Old Town Road” the longest-running hip-hop song to claim the top spot. It has eclipsed Black Eyed Peas’ “Boom Boom Pow,” Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth’s “See You Again,” and Eminem’s “Lose Yourself.”  If it lasts one more week, “Old Town Road” will move into an eight-way tie with Whitney Houston’s “I Will Always Love You,” Boyz II Men’s “I’ll Make Love To You,” Los Del Río’s “Macarena (Bayside Boys Remix),” Elton John’s “Candle In The Wind 1997,” Mariah Carey’s “We Belong Together,” the Black Eyed Peas’ “I Gotta Feeling,” and Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars’ “Uptown Funk.” If it makes it to 15 weeks it will stand as one of only three songs to endure that long.
