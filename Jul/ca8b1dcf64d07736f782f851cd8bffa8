The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) said its operatives have arrested Tukur Yabo, Director of Works and Housing, Tureta Local Government Area, Sokoto State, and Hon. Abubakar Maigishiri, a councilor in the local government for allegedly diverting N980,000. Others arrested over the same offense were Danjuma Ibrahim, a cashier with the Ministry of Social Welfare and Community Development, Sokoto State and Sambo Abdullahi, a staff of the same ministry. EFCCâ€™s acting Spokesperson, Tony Orilade, in a statement, yesterday, in Abuja, disclosed that they were arrested on July 25, 2019, following the investigation of a petition alleging that some employees of Sokoto Marshal Corps/Neighbourhood Watch Operatives of Tureta Local Government were not paid their April, May, and June salaries. Orilade alleged that the suspects diverted the salaries for personal use. The spokesman claimed investigations revealed that Yabo conspired with Maigishiri, and the two others to share among themselves, the salaries of
the five Neighbourhood employees. He further disclosed that, in the course of interrogation, they confessed to the criminal diversion of the salaries. He said N300,000, being part of the diverted money, had been recovered from them. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
