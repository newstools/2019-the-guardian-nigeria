Regarding the envoy Darroch, Trump declared: “We will no longer deal with him.” “I do not know the Ambassador, but he is not liked or well thought of within the U.S,” the president said. The British prime minister’s office called the leak “unacceptable” but also defended the work of ambassadors in providing “honest, unvarnished assessments of politics in their country.” “The prime minister has full faith in her ambassador to Washington,” a Downing Street spokesperson said. The release of the cables came just a month after a state visit by Trump that included a 41-gun salute welcome at Buckingham Palace and a banquet dinner with the queen. “While I thoroughly enjoyed the magnificent State Visit last month, it was the Queen who I was most impressed with!” Trump tweeted.
