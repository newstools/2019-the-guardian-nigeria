The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) yesterday handed over a choice property forfeited by the late Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, to the Voice of Nigeria (VON), which now becomes the new headquarters of the broadcast station. The property, located at Plot 1386, Uda Crescent, Off Aminu Kano Crescent, Wuse 2, Abuja, was handed over to VON by the EFCC Secretary, Olanipekun Olukoyede, who represented the Acting Chairman of the commission, Ibrahim Magu. Magu stated: “This is an epic moment in the history of Nigeria. This is one of the buildings that was confiscated from a fraudulent person who stole the money of Nigeria.” He called Nigerians to join hands in the fight against the cankerworm of corruption, saying: “Such was necessary. If not for us, but for the generation coming behind.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
