An Anambra State-based Medical Consultant, Professor Peter Emeka Katchy, has expressed worry over the death of 1.5 million people worldwide yearly from either Hepatitis B or C, saying the disease is claiming more lives than HIV/AIDS. Prof. Katchy stated this yesterday in Onitsha, while speaking on the significance of the 2019 World Hepatitis Day with the theme: Finding the Missing Millions. He said over 80 per cent of those affected with viral hepatitis B and C were unaware of their status, warning that viral hepatitis transcends region or people, as it was a global challenge. “Types A and E hepatitis are typically caused by consumption of contaminated food or water. “Hepatitis B, C and D usually occur as a result of contact with infected body fluids, toxic substances such as alcohol, certain drugs and autoimmune diseases,” he added.
