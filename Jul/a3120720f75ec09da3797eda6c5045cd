Moore said two Walmart employees were killed in what he described as a “senseless violent act.” He said the wounded police officer was “saved by his (bulletproof) vest.” Southaven Mayor Darren Musselwhite told reporters the incident was “an isolated event.” “It was a disgruntled employee,” Musselwhite said. “It’s someone that had a personal grievance with his employer.” A Walmart employee told a local television station the gunman had worked at the store for 25 years before being fired. In a statement, Walmart said it was “heartbroken by the loss of two valued members of our team.” Southaven is a suburb of Memphis, Tennessee, which lies just to the north over the state line.
