 [FILES] Shehu Sani  They, however, said the campaign might be for positive reasons. It was reported on a national daily newspaper that a Kaduna politician was allegedly behind the “faceless groups” responsible for pushing the Asiwaju 2023 presidential agenda, to sow a seed of discord between the President and Senator Tinubu, which could ruin his chances of running for Presidency. Kaduna APC has distanced itself from sponsoring any campaign to create disunity between President Buhari and Tinubu. The State’s APC  Assistant Publicity Secretary, Salisu Tanko Wusono, said he knew nothing about the campaign. Wusono said:  “I am not aware. Maybe the newspaper, which published the story is in the best position to know who is who…’’ Senator Sani said: “ Yes, it is possible, and it may be positive.” Similarly, Dawaki said the chances of the campaign coming from Kaduna State, was high,  as Governor Nasir el-Rufai has many enemies, who are ready to frustrate him. “I don’t think they did this to cause problem between Buhari and Tinubu. They did it because they want to get something from Tinubu and to provoke el-Rufai because of his presidential ambition for 2023. “El-Rufai has been provoking Kaduna citizens and people are now ready to provoke him too. Everybody knows that el-Rufai is not in good terms with Tinubu for now. So, people will do whatever they can to frustrate him, make him irrelevant in Nigerian politics, because he did the same thing to them,” he said.
