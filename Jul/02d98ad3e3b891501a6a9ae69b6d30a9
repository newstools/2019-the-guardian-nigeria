While one might be tempted to store their favourite SPF under the sink because of the damp weather and rainy days, one also has to remember that protecting the skin against UV damage is, in fact, a year-round commitment. Exposure to the sun’s UV rays although incidental might, eventual result in fine lines and sagging skin. As such, a thick layer of one’s favourite broad-spectrum SPF is just as necessary during the current rainy season as it is during the dry season. Although some might still be confused about why it is essential to wear sunscreen even while it is raining, here are five reasons to explain why wearing sunscreen all year long is necessary: MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA – JANUARY 10: Venus Williams of the USA gets sunscreen applied during a practice session ahead of the 2017 Australian Open at Melbourne Park on January 10, 2017 in Melbourne, Australia. (Photo by Michael Dodge/Getty Images) We cannot stress this enough. This rainy, damp weather is even worse because you have to work harder at preventing dry skin and wrinkles. While one might not realise this, this weather is extremely tasking on the skin and dries it out even more than usual, which is a huge horror, especially for those with dry skin. Sunscreen, however, contains clinically proven anti-ageing studies that would prevent the damages caused by UV rays, collagen, and elastin. This means that wearing sunscreen protects you from the harmful effects that might be caused by as little as one UV ray of light. The best sunscreens for 2019 . Photo Wirecutter Unfortunately, many people assume that as they spend most of their time indoors taking shelter from the rain, they are even more protected from UV rays and their harmful effects. New research has shown that pigment cells are not just stimulated by bright UV rays from the sun, lower doses of ambient and infrared rays are also recognised causes of hyperpigmentation. These rays could be emitted from computer screens of lamps. As such, even while being holed up indoors avoiding the rain, you can be largely exposed to hyperpigmentation, which means that there is an absolute need to have on sunscreen all the time. While on very hot days you may have to reapply sunscreen, there is an increased need for this on cold, damps days. This weather erodes sunscreen even faster by wearing it away and thus reducing its effectiveness. Because of this, it is not just enough to apply sunscreen just once in the morning and think that this would be enough for the entire day. It is recommended that sunscreen be reapplied every two hours for more effectiveness. This way, there is a guarantee of more coverage, less prone effects to the harsh effects UV, and infrared rays. Sunscreen should also be worn in this cold, windy period, as it contributes greatly to a maintained skin tone. Sunscreen prevents the skin from all forms of damage due to discolouration and UV rays damage. As a result, the skin is even more protected, allowing it to remain smooth and the skin tone even more even. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-970927 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/A-lady-applying-sunscreen.-Photo-Panpica.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/A-lady-applying-sunscreen.-Photo-Panpica.jpg 1280w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/A-lady-applying-sunscreen.-Photo-Panpica-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/A-lady-applying-sunscreen.-Photo-Panpica-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/A-lady-applying-sunscreen.-Photo-Panpica-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/A-lady-applying-sunscreen.-Photo-Panpica-281x158.jpg 281w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/A-lady-applying-sunscreen.-Photo-Panpica-562x316.jpg 562w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/A-lady-applying-sunscreen.-Photo-Panpica-531x299.jpg 531w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/A-lady-applying-sunscreen.-Photo-Panpica-487x274.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/A-lady-applying-sunscreen.-Photo-Panpica-974x548.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/A-lady-applying-sunscreen.-Photo-Panpica-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> It is well known that cancer, like other diseases, never take a break and can resurface due to unhealthy lifestyles. The sun not shining as often and rain falling even more often do not mean that UV rays and their harmful effects are far off. Even on cloudy days, up to 80% of the sun’s UV rays can still pass through. During this wet, cold season, one is still at risk of cancer and should make sure to protect ones’ self. As 90% of non-melanoma skin cancers have been linked to UV exposure from sunlight, one should wear sunscreen daily. Also, it is important to remember that repeated DNA damage might result in skin cancer. Sun Protection Factor (SPF) sunscreen protects the skin from UVB rays, which are the major causes of sunburn, skin damage, and also significant contributors to cancer. While it might seem safe to go out on a cool, cloudy day without sunscreen, the skin is still exposed to just a little, if not just the same harm as on a normal day. SPF sunscreens are a necessity at all times of the day and all seasons.
