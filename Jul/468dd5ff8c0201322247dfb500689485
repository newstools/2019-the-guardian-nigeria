Umar Danbatta, NCC Boss. Prof. Umar Danbatta, executive vice chairman, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has said that it is an offence for any telecommunication operator to disclose data of subscribers on their network. Danbatta, who stated this at the 88th Edition of the Telecom Consumer Parliament with the theme: “Challenges to Cybercrime: The Role of Telecom Service Providers” recently in Abuja, said that. cybercrime had become pervasive in the country, adding that every consumer should be protected, except in exceptional cases with permission of the security authorities. The vice chairman said the commission came up with such annual events so as to sensitise Nigerians, to ensure adequate protection of networks thereby taking measures to protect access to privacy. He said: “It is wrong for telecommunications operators to disclose any data identity of subscribers on their network without permission. It is unlawful. “If such instances take place, then the subscriber in question can escalate this matter to the NCC and we will investigate and establish whether that is the case and take necessary regulatory measures. “The database of subscribers with network operators is not supposed to be disclosed to anyone. “It can be done lawfully with interception project in place where such data can be acquired in the interest of security of the nation. “We must try to ensure the security and privacy of all subscribers on the telecommunication networks, that is the only way we can instil confidence in subscribers and other Nigerians to patronise telecommunications service.” He, however, said operators had been encouraged to embark on the know your customer programme as it was very important for customers to be enlightened on what to do when challenges surfaced.
