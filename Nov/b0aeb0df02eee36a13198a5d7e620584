As part of the actions targeted at reducing the incidences of rape, defilement and child trafficking in Ekiti State, the Federation of International Women Lawyers (FIDA) and Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Ekiti State Council, has held a sensitisation program against the scourges in the state. The unions, during the public procession, expressed sadness at the increasing rate of rape, defilement, teenage pregnancy and child abuse in the state, saying that strong actions must be taken to stem the tide and protect the rights of the children. The procession, which was part of the activities lined up for the 2019 NUJ Press Week, took off at the NUJ’s office located at Oke Bareke, Ado-Ekiti and down to Irona Market, Atikankan, Okeyinmi junction, Okesa and Fajuyi areas of capital city. Also, the chairperson of FIDA, Mrs. Seyi Ojo, while addressing the people, advised those with uncontrollable libidos to weigh the consequences of their actions, saying the laws are already in place to deal decisively with such individuals. The NUJ Chairman, Ekiti Council, Rotimi Ojomoyela, said it sounds incredible and appalling for a 50-year-old man to be having sex with a minor. “Some men even have incestuous relationship with their own daughters and even going to the extent of impregnating them. Ekiti is a land of honour and integrity. So, this sordid scenario should not be allowed to continue.” Also, Chairman of the Trade Union Congress (TUC), Sola Adigun, urged parents to comply with the government’s directive that all children of school age must be registered in school. “Don’t make children slaves by asking them to hawk during school hours. This can expose them to sexual molestation or deprive them of education.” Monitor your children’s movement and don’t allow anyone you can’t trust to take them away for sexual slavery,” he said.
