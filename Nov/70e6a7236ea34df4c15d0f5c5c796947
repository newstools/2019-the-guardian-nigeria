Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has said that synergy between the church and the government at all levels is very critical for national development. Chief Obasanjo made this assertion yesterday at Igbor, Gwer East Council of Benue State, while laying the foundation for the construction of the School for Children with Special Needs. The former president commended the Bishop of the Makurdi Catholic Diocese, Wilfred Anagbe, for establishing a school for children with special needs.He explained that the idea to establish the school by the Catholic Diocese of Makurdi was in fulfilment of God’s word. “Giving a sense of belonging to the less-privileged like the blind, the deaf and the cripple will attract God’s blessings on Benue,” he stated.
 According to him, people with disabilities are human beings created by God and should be given a sense of belonging in all ramifications. The Ota farmer urged Benue people and the Christian community to embrace farming, adding that “land is a renewable resource while oil is not.”Earlier, Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue had told Obasanjo that the strong partnership between Benue government and the Catholic Church was for the overall good and development of the state.He thanked the former president for honouring the church’s invitation to lay the foundation for the school building.On his part, Bishop Anagbe described the ground-breaking ceremony by the former president as simple but symbolic in the history of the Christian community in Benue. After laying the foundation, Obasanjo proceeded to Ihowe also in Gwer East to inspect his farm.He assured Benue people of abundant opportunities when the farm resume full operations.
