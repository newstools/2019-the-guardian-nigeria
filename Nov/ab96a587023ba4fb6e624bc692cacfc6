As of now, everything is okay.” Djokovic suffered a shoulder problem at the US Open in September but recovered from it to win in Tokyo and Paris. “I think it’s going to be enough time for him to prepare for our first match which is going to be on Wednesday,” said Zimonjic. Serbia opens their campaign against Japan on Wednesday morning before meeting France in their second group match 24 hours later. The Davis Cup’s new 18-team format has replaced the former World Group. The nations have been split into six three-team groups, with the winners and two best runners-up advancing to the quarter-finals.
