Pressed to provide more homes for the teeming populace, the Lagos State Government has pledged its commitment to the upscale Ilubirin foreshore housing project completion and delivery of the estate by 2020. The expeditious development is a joint venture between the government and the First Investment Development Company (FIDC). FIDC also made a commitment to the project. Ilubirin first Residential offering, the “Premier Collection” will provide a total of 108 spacious apartments across five blocks consisting of 20 studios, 64 two-bedrooms and 24 three-bedroom apartments. Speaking during a recent inspection/facility tour of the on-going work at the estate situated on the side-view of the picturesque lagoon, Lagos Island, State’s Commissioner of Housing, Moruf Akinderu- Fatai said with the commitment from both parties, the dreams of Lagosians for a novel, all-purpose housing complex that seamlessly fuses living, commercial offerings and leisure will soon be fulfilled. “We have plan to deliver the first phase of the project (residential) in the fourth quarter of 2020 to be followed by the commercial and entertainment/leisure parks in 2021. “ Ilubirin estate is a critically important development for the city that will rejuvenate the area. We have a duty to ensure that more Lagos residents become home owners and that the homes themselves are built to global and international standards”, Akinderu-Fatai declared. While commending the initiative and steadfastness of the management of FIDC to the realisation of the Ilubirin dream, the Commissioner expressed optimism that when fully delivered, the project will go a long way in addressing the housing deficit in Lagos, the seventh fastest growing city in the world. Re-echoing the Commissioner’s resolve, FIDC Project Director, Wale Bamgbelu said there is “a collective determination and commitment from both parties to the timely delivery of Ilubiri, which will set a new standard for mixed-used housing estates”. He added: “Ilubirin will create a benchmark for future community development in Lagos state anchored on the concept of ‘live, work and play’ with not only residential offerings but also offices, shopping, new school, hotel, medical center, leisure facilities and a brand new Marina for the Lagoon”. Bamgbelu further disclosed that a revised master plan was recently completed, stressing that this will help in optimizing the Marina and “creating a new shopping spine through the new neighborhood”.
