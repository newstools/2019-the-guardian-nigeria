The National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools (NAPPS) and Women-in-Arts have come up with the idea of using theatre to raise 1,000 bags of rice for different orphanage homes in Lagos State. NAPPS, in conjunction with the Women-in-Arts, a strictly-women performing Arts group in Nigeria, said it was part of their humanitarian and corporate social responsibility (CSR) support for the motherless children, aimed to set the record for the largest humanitarian food-raising initiative in Nigeria. Tagged “Motherless Babies Day with Adumadeyin and Friends”, is championed by the president, NAPPS, Lagos State, and will bring together every member school under NAPPS, Lagos State, to the musical performance of DEAR MAMA, by the Women-in-Arts Group, to help raise 1000 bags of rice for orphanages in Lagos State. According to the group, the event, which would be marked on Motherless Babies’ Day, November 15, 2019, would be the first edition and would be celebrated by Alhaji Wasiu Adumadeyin and the entire NAPPS in Lagos State, with the Women-In-Art and other kind-hearted Nigerians. Women-In-Art Humanity Ambassador, Miss Diamond Chukwuma said: “The project is entirely a no-cash project, as donations is strictly a bag of rice by schools, organisations and individuals. “It is a humanitarian project committed to raising food support for the orphanages in Nigeria, thereby showing our strong love and care for the motherless.” She said the focus is to support the orphans, and make them feel truly loved and appreciated. She called on public-spirited Nigerians to support the project, adding that the group will also continue to support the orphans through her 90 days ride across Nigeria through 30 states with the Ride Nigeria Team.
