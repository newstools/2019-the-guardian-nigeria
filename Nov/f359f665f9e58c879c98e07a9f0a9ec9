Ochor Extends hands of fellowship to opposition
The Deputy Speaker of Delta State House of Assembly, Christopher Ochor Ochor, has described the Appeal Court judgment in Benin City at the weekend as victory for people of Ukwuani Constituency and democracy. The Appeal Court Election Tribunal sitting in Benin City, headed by Justice Haruna Tsammani, struck out the case on technical ground that the All Progressives Congress (APC) failed to nominate the appellant, Mr. David Ochonogor, at the time of the election within the time allowed to nominate candidate and that his party failed to nominate him as its candidate. In a statement in Asaba yesterday, a copy received by The Guardian, Ochor stated that the ruling finally put to rest who is the authentic winner of the March 2019 state Assembly election for the constituency, as the people gave their mandate on that date. According to him: “Today’s Appeal Court ruling in my favour is a great victory. It showed that the people of Ukwuani spoke in March 2019 when they voted for the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and elected me as the best choice of Ukwuani State Constituency. “The court had exonerated me and removed the stress, which had been a big burden on not just me, but also the entire people of the constituency. This is the fourth victory in this election matter, and this is the second victory in the Appeal Court decision in my favour. I give God the glory, as He stands firmly by me and the people of Ukwuani. “With this victory, I promise to focus on the main job of effective representation of Ukwuani, and I call on the entire people to be patient as they will not regret electing me, and PDP. “I extend the hands of fellowship to the opposition to take part in building our local council and move it to enjoy the dividend that democracy brings to society worldwide. Today’s Appeal Court ruling is for the people of Ukwuani.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
