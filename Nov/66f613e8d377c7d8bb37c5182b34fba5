Majority Leader of the House of Representatives, Alhassan Ado Doguwa, has refuted media reports that principal officers of the lower legislative chamber have been allocated official cars. In a statement issued by his Media Assistant, Hassan Inuwa, he said it was not true that he and other principal officers of the House received three official cars from Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila. The House Leader, who is warming up for a court ordered rerun election in his Doguwa/Tudunwada federal constituency of Kano State urged those behind what he described as campaign of calumny to desist in the interest of the country. “It is on record that no principal officer, serving or non-serving, have been allocated any vehicles yet by the House. Therefore, to say that the former member collected official vehicles during this transition was out of place, derogatory and wild machinations from political opponents to smear his name. “That as a law abiding citizen, Doguwa would never indulge in any action that could undermine the honour of the House and sanctity of the rule of law. “That it is a fact that Doguwa enjoys tremendous respect and good rapport with his colleagues, the Speaker, leadership of the house and the media and he wishes that the camaraderie remains intact.” “While he prays that the rerun election would prove him victorious again, he urges political actors to desist from taking actions that could unnecessarily overheat the polity,” the statement reads.
