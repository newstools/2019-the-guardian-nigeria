The rally in the domestic equities market was sustained for a third consecutive week and being the first time since May 2019, as investors continue to hunt for positive returns amidst depressed fixed-income yields. Consequently, the All-Share Index (ASI) appreciated by 0.52 per cent to close the week at 26,991.41 points, following four consecutive days of gains. All other indices finished higher with the exception of NSE Premium, NSE Banking, NSE-AFR Bank Value and NSE Industrial Goods indices which declined by 0.49 per cent , 0.86 per cent 0.28 per cent and 2.25 per cent respectively. Analysts expressed optimism that the stock market will continue to soar, especially as fixed-income yields remain on the downtrend. Specifically, analysts at Codros Capital Limited said: “In our view, the still compelling valuations and attractive dividends yields have driven market performance over the past few weeks, a reaction to a limited outlet for investments given recent policy directives limiting domestic participation in the fixed income market. “In the short term, we expect that the stock market will continue to benefit, especially as FI yields remain on the downtrend.” The Chief Research Officer of Investdata Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omodion, said the current undervalued state of the market offers investors opportunities to position for short and medium-to-long-term views. “We expect that investors would target fundamentally sound and dividend-paying stocks for possible capital appreciation as the year draws down. “Also, traders and investors need to change their trading strategies due to NSE’s pricing methodology, CBN directives and its impact on the economy in the nearest future,” he said.
