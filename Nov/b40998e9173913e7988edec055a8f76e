Nigerian lawmaker Senator Biodun Olujimi on Tuesday reintroduced the gender equality bill. The bill was first rejected in March 2016 when some lawmakers argued that the Nigerian Constitution was clear on the rights of all citizens whether male or female is one of the 12 bills read for the first time. Christened ‘Gender and Equal Opportunity Bill, 2019’, the legislation sought to guarantee the rights of women to equal opportunities in employment, equal rights to inheritance for both male and female children, equal rights for women in marriage and divorce, and equal access to education, property/land ownership and inheritance. It also seeks to protect the rights of widows, guarantee appropriate measures against gender discrimination in political and public life and ensure the prohibition of violence towards women. The proposed law also seeks equal opportunity, development advancement for all Nigerian citizens irrespective of gender as well as promote girls’ access to education, freedom for women to participate in any economic activity and their right to freedom from violence. Reintroducing the bill, Olujimi said the proposed law has been re-engineered to suit everyone. Olujimi said the bill is aimed at eliminating all forms of discrimination against women and would guarantee equal opportunity, development advancement for all Nigerian citizens irrespective of gender. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters headed by David Umaru for study and consideration.
