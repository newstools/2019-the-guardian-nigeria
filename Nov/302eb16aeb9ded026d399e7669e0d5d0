The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) have accused the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of awarding over 100,000 votes to candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Yahaya Bello in Okene Local Government area of Kogi State. “The PDP issues a stern caution to the INEC over the fictitious votes being bandied from Okene and other arears to favour the APC,” PDP spokesman Kola Ologbondiyan said in a statement. “The party demands the immediate cancellation of such allocated results, particularly in Okene Local Government Area.” The opposition party said it cannot “accept the provocative alteration of results from polling units as well as allocation of fictitious votes, particularly the awarding of 112, 000 votes to APC in Okene.” Although the PDP did not present any evidence to support its allegations, it said “the people of Kogi state have glaring evidence of alterations of figures to reduce the vote of the PDP and allocate imported figures to the APC.” The PDP also accused Yahaya Bello and the APC of comprising highly placed INEC officials with huge sums of money to alter result in their favour. Ologbondiyan noted that the declaration of “the figures being bandied for the APC will be a validation of the bribery allegation.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
