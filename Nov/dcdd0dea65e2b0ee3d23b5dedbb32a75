Acting Director-General, Nigeria Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NNRA), Dr. Idris Yau, has charged radiation safety officers in the Oil and Gas Industry to always comply with international standard of acquisition, using radiation equipment, as well as calibrated dosimeters and survey meters to ensure the safety of lives and property. He said this while declaring open the 10th national training course for radiation safety officers in the oil and gas industry, organised by the National Institute of Radiation Protection & Research (NIRPR), Ibadan; and NNRA, in collaboration with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), at the Conference Centre, University of Ibadan, Oyo State. Represented by the Acting General Manager, Department of Authorisation and Enforcement, NNRA, Mr. Adamu Hussaini, Yau said it was compulsory for any facility using ionizing radiation to have among its radiation protection equipment well-calibrated dosimeters and survey meters. The five-day training course, according to Yau, had over 100 participants in attendance who are expected to be certified at the end of the training. He said: “It is an obligation for any facility using ionizing radiation to have among its radiation protection equipment, well-calibrated dosimeters, and survey meters. Such instruments used in dose measurements anywhere in Nigeria, including the ones you will be using in your various departments, must be standardised against the Secondary Standards available in the laboratory. “ The laboratory has traceability to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) primary standard laboratory, where ionization chamber is also calibrated.” NNRA was established in 2001 by the Nuclear Safety and Radiation Protection Act 19 of 1995 and charged with the responsibility of Nuclear Safety and Radiological regulation.
