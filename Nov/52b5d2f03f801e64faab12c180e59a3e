The Plateau House of Assembly has restrained the Jos Electricity Distribution (JED) from distributing bills to customers in Pankshin council area and parts of the state until it meters them and improves power supply. The resolution followed a motion of urgent public importance moved by the member representing Pankshin North, Philip Dasun, on the power company’s “shortchanging” of its customers in his area.

The session presided over by Speaker Abok Nuhu Ayuba, summoned the electricity firm to clarify the poor power situation.
