I had the pleasure of learning how to make this soup during my NYSC days in Bayelsa State. You see, before my ‘stint’ in Bayelsa, I did not know that it was possible to eat rice with Banga soup. Every restaurant or ‘food place’ I visited while in Bayelsa sold rice but never sold stew with it. You either eat it with Banga or you don’t eat it at all. So, I had to adjust my Lagos taste buds, learn how to make Banga soup and live like a Bayelsa indigene and I haven’t stopped making it since then. See below for the recipe. You can thank me later. Ingredients   Method: Kindly remember to remove the Banga stick before serving, serve with Starch or Fufu.
