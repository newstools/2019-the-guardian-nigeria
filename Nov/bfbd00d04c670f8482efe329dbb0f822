Daniel Craig is officially 00-Done with being James Bond. In a chat with Stephen Colbert on Friday’s episode of “The Late Show”, the actor confirmed that the upcoming “No Time To Die” is his last outing as the fictional British spy James Bond. Are you done with Bond?” Colbert asked. “Yes,” replied Craig. “You’re done with Bond?” repeated Colbert. “It’s done,” said Craig. Craig debuted as Bond in 2006′s “Casino Royale” and also portrayed the character in 2008’s “Quantum of Solace,” 2012’s “Skyfall” and 2015’s “Spectre.” The longest-serving Bond had, however, initially been hesitant to reprise his role in the 25th installment of the franchise, which is slated for an April 2020 release. Craig told German website Express earlier this week that “someone else needs to have a go,” reported Esquire magazine. Although Idris Elba has repeatedly shut down rumors that he will become the first Black Bond, it is still unclear who will replace Craig in the role. Elsewhere on “The Late Show,” Craig (who was promoting his new movie “Knives Out”) taught Colbert how to speak with a Welsh accent.
