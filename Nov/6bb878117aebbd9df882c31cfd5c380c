Coach Robert Moreno has rewarded Morata for his rich vein of form after the striker was left out for games against Norway and Sweden last month. Moreno also called up Dinamo Zagreb attacking midfielder Dani Olmo for the first time while Borussia Dortmund forward Paco Alcacer came back in after previously being omitted due to injury. Jordi Alba aggravated a hamstring strain against Slavia Prague on Tuesday, meaning Sergio Busquets is the only Barcelona player in the squad. Real Madrid are only slightly better represented with two in Sergio Ramos and Dani Carvajal. Spain sit top of Group F, five points ahead of Sweden, after winning six and drawing two of their eight matches so far.
