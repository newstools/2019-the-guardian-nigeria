As unchecked arbitrary charges that have bedevilled Nigerian seaports bite harder, some concerned operators have resolved to withdraw their operations, if urgent actions are not taken to halt the trend.
   
The group, under the aegis of Concerned Freight Forwarders and Transporters, has vowed to withdraw their services from the nation’s seaports over illegal charges by shipping companies and terminal operators.
   
Speaking with journalists in Lagos, yesterday, the group also threatened to take legal steps against erring shipping companies and terminal operators, even as they issued a 14-day ultimatum to withdraw their services if the government fails to take urgent action.  Secretary to the group, John Ubaka, said the meeting aimed at ensuring 48-hour cargo clearance is feasible.
