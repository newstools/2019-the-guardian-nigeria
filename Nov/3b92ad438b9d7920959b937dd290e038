Iggy Azalea and Alice Charter It was nearly four months ago that four times Grammy-nominated rapper, Iggy Azalea dropped her sophomore album, In My Defense, which spurned hits like ‘Sally walker’ and “Start”. Ahead of the release of her extended play (EP) “Wicked Lips” that is slated for release next week, the Australian rapper has unveiled the first single, “Lola”. On this track, she collaborated with rising star Alice Chater and in the accompanying music video, the two blonde bombshells could easily pass as twins. The Thom Kerr directed music video is set in an asylum (Celestial Heights) while the song itself samples Mambo Italiano. The video begins with three older women dressed as nurses giving Iggy and Alice their medication.  After taking their pills, Alice and Iggy’s tongues become extended and the room changes red and green colour scheme with bold art on the walls. They then move into different scenes throughout the clip – a hallway adorned with artwork and a Japanese-inspired room. Other parts of the video see the girls lying in baths filled with pills and wearing hospital gowns in a brightly-lit room. With multi-platinum smash hits such as Fancy, Black Widow, Problem, and Kream, Iggy is one of the most successful female artists of all time. Check out her latest effort below:
