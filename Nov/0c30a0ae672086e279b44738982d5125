The fraudster, Hope Olusegun Aroke, a convicted internet scammer, is serving a 24-year jail term. The EFCC said Aroke recently masterminded an internet scam worth $100 million from prison. “Investigation revealed that he masterminded the commission of internet scam worth over $100, 000, 000 whilst serving his jail term,” the EFCC said. The anti-graft agency said the jailed fraudster was still in active communication with other high valued targets. It, did not, however, say how Aroke bypassed prison officials to still stay in touch with his crime network. EFCC disclosed that Aroke’s accomplices are being investigated for various offences relating to computer fraud and money laundering.
