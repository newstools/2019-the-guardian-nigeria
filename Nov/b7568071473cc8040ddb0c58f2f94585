Twenty-one years after he ascended the throne of his forebears, the Eleruwa of Eruwa, Oba Samuel Adegbola, was, yesterday, dethroned by the Supreme Court in a judgment by a A five-man panel of the apex court, led by Justice Muhammad Dattijo, dismissed the appeal by Adegbola and six others. It would be recalled that an Oyo State High Court had on January 26, 2011 dethroned Adegbola. But not satisfied, the appellants had appealed against the concurrent decisions of the Oyo State High Court and the Court of Appeal, which had both ruled against them over the chieftaincy tussle. In upholding the decisions of the two lower courts, the apex court resolved all the five issues raised in the appeal against the appellants.The sacked monarch was installed the Eleruwa in 1998 by the Oyo State Government amidst protracted protests by members of the rightful ruling house after the last Eleruwa, the late Oba Bolanle Olaniyan, who was from the Akalako Ruling House, passed on on May 1, 1994. Although his nomination and selection by the kingmakers were challenged by the Laribikusi Ruling House, who argued that he was not a member of the ruling house, but belong to Akalako Ruling House. From where the previous monarch emerged, the state government went ahead to inaugurate him. Those who challenged the authenticity of Adegbolaâ€™s claims to the throne were Mr. James Olatunde Idowu and Alhaji Ajao. Joined in the suit, besides Adegbola, were the Governor of Oyo State; the Attorney General; Ibarapa Local Government; Chiefs Jacob Adewusi; Femi Atanda; Idowu Okeowo, E. Ojebisi and Mr. Kasali I.
