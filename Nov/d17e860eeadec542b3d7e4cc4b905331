“Christian Genius Billionaire” Kanye West will be paying a visit to televangelist Joel Osteen’s Houston megachurch this Sunday. West, who released his first gospel album, Jesus is King, last month, will be having a 15-to-20-minute conversation with Osteen at Lakewood Church’s 11 a.m. service, the Houston Chronicle reports. Lakewood spokesperson Donald Iloff Jr. told the Chronicle that the conversation will revolve around West’s journey to faith. The rapper will reportedly make another appearance at the evangelical church’s 7 p.m. young adult service, this time with his Sunday Service choir. However, West’s visit has not yet been announced on Lakewood Church’s website. As of Tuesday afternoon, the site still advertises that the evening service will feature performances by the Christian musician Tauren Wells. West’s visit to Lakewood comes months after he started holding pop-up religious events across the country, sometimes at churches and accompanied by pastors. His wife, the reality star Kim Kardashian, has described these “Sunday Services” as a “musical ministry” where “they talk about Jesus and God.” According to CBS affiliate KHOU 11, Osteen was the one who invited West to bring his Sunday Service performance to Lakewood,  The pair apparently struck up a friendship through phone conversations about faith. “Kanye and Joel are friends,” Iloff told the Chronicle. “He’s been wanting to come out for some time and it just worked out for this weekend.” Osteen’s church draws about 45,000 members every weekend, filling out a 600,000-square-foot stadium that was formerly home to the Houston Rockets. Millions more watch Osteen’s sermons through weekly television broadcasts. The pastor regularly packs stadiums around the country during his preaching tours.
