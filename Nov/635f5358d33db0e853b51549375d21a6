The death row inmate’s brother, Rodrick Reed, says he got to meet Kim, Kanye, and Joel Osteen on Sunday at the Lakewood Church, where Ye held a “Jesus Is King” performance that night with his choir. Rodrick says he was brought backstage during Sunday’s events and discussed his brother’s case with Joel and the Wests. Kanye said he still plans to visit Rodney but needs to work out the legal works to make it happen. Earlier in the year, she was with Rodney when word came in the Governor had granted a stay of execution. Rodney was set to be executed Wednesday, but now the courts are ready to hear his case again, so, he could be vindicated after 20 years in prison. His brother, Rodrick, says he and Kim talked about how she became so passionate about Rodney’s case, and she told him it was a Dr. Phil special the show that showed the interview with Rodney Reed, that got her interested. As for Joel, Rodrick says the preacher told him he’d pray for Rodney. Rodrick added that he’s grateful Kim’s giving his family a megaphone for their cause. Rodney Reed was scheduled for execution on November 20, however, he maintains his innocence. He has been on death row for the past 21 years for the murder of Stacey Stites in Bastrop, Texas, despite an enormous amount of evidence that supports his innocence.
