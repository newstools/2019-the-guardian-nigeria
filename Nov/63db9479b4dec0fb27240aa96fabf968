She said the present administration understands the critical role MSMEs play in providing employment opportunities and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The Consultant added that the need to enhance the competitiveness of MSMEs in the state made the Governor recently approve the establishment of the state’s Enterprise Development Agency.
