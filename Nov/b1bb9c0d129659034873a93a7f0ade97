The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)has said there was no robbery attack at its Benin branch in Edo State. “Stories that armed robbers attacked CBN Benin branch on Tuesday 12/11/19 are untrue,” CBN tweeted late Tuesday. There were unconfirmed reports on Tuesday that some robbers attempted to break into the CBN branch in Benin when a bullion van carrying cash to an unknown commercial bank was exiting the premises. The reports claimed that the robbers were, however, repelled by the police security team at the bank. But the Edo State Police Command denied the reports. Edo State Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of operations Ayoola Ajala said that the reports were not true as there was no robbery attempt at the bank. He said that the incident had to do with some cultists who were being chased around the Museum area of Benin city. “When we heard about the incident, we called the unit commander of security at the bank, who denied that there was any robbery attempt there,” Ajala said. Ajala said the cultists were only trying to escape through Akpakpava road where the CBN is situated and did not attempt to rob the bank. He, however, said that two of the cultists had been arrested some arms, while others escaped.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
