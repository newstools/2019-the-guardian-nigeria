The Department of State Services (DSS) has said that it can only release the convener of #RevolutionNow protest, Omoyele Sowore, to his sureties. Spokesman of the secret police, Peter Afunanya, stated yesterday that since no surety had shown up, Sowore would remain in DSS custody. He added that despite serial and unwarranted provocations, the service, as a professional and responsible organisation, did not shoot at the so-called protesters and could not have done so. “For emphasis, the service reiterates its avowed readiness to release Sowore once the processes are concluded. It maintains that the appropriate persons have still not turned up to take delivery of Sowore,” he said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
