However, there has been an assurance from one of the actors: Handler Massey, who portrays Will Horton on “Days,” who took to Twitter following the news; “We’re not being cancelled,” he tweeted Tuesday. “We are pausing production because we are so far ahead of schedule (and it saves us $). Days will still air during the entire hiatus, so you won’t miss anything!” “Days of our Lives” reportedly shoots eight months in advance and has enough content to air episodes through next summer, while Sony Pictures Television and NBC decide whether or not the series will be renewed for Season 56, THR reports. If the series is renewed, the cast will negotiate new contracts and resume taping next spring. The soap opera has won several Daytime Emmy Awards during its long run, including the outstanding drama series title in 1978, 2013, 2015 and 2018.
