The Country Representative of the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), Mr. Suffyan Koroma, has disclosed that 2.6 million people face worse “food insecurity and hunger” in the Northeastern Nigeria. The decade-long insurgency in the region has also displaced over 7.7 million people in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states.
Koroma raised the alarm in Abuja at Cadre Harmonise (CH) report presentation workshop. The CH analysis also found about 4.02 million people in 16 northern states and Federal Capital Territory facing food insecurity from October to December this year. According to him, Boko Haram insurgency in the northeast continues to have devastating impacts on food and nutrition status of people in the three states. “In the current period of October to December, 2019, an estimated 2.6 million people in the three states are classified as facing crisis or worse levels of food insecurity,” he said. “There was a reduction of about 300,000 people from the verge of starvation last June,” said the report.
