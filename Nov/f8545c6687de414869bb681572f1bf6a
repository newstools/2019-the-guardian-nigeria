 People of Ondo State trooped out en-masse waiting for his arrival. Photo: TWITTER/ROTIMIAKEREDOLU  Party members and leaders received the governor in a carnival-like atmosphere at the Akure Airport. While away, there was speculation that the governor was sick, the reason he stayed that long in Abuja, though the state government refuted the claim. Speaking after landing at the airport, Akeredolu said he attended to his health and stayed back to recuperate in Abuja. The governor said: “Yes, I needed to seek medical attention. It was nothing so serious as overblown because it is routine. But on my return, I needed to take some time off to strengthen the attention based on advice. But my stay in Abuja was, indeed, not a serious period to even rest, because I had to attend to a lot of issues that will move the state forward.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
