Kristofer Hivju, who played Tormund Giantsbane, said the different ending exists, but he doused hope of it being shared publicly or replacing the one that caused such an uproar in May when the show concluded after eight seasons. “Well, we shot an alternative ending,” the Norwegian actor told Metro. “That was mostly for fun but I don’t know if I’m allowed to tell you about that.” Pressed for details, Hivju replied: “I won’t tell you! But it was fun.” Game Of Thrones ended with Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) being murdered by Jon Snow (Kit Harington), Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) being named Queen in the North, and younger bro Bran Stark (Isaac Hempstead-Wright) ascending to King of the (now) Six Kingdoms. More than 1.8 million viewers signed a petition for the final season to be done over, which was eventually brushed off by those in charge. Despite the show’s lukewarm reception, the final series won the Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series at this year’s ceremony. Now that the critics know there’s an alternative Game Of Thrones ending out there, even if it was never intended to be seen, they might want it to be released. A new prequel titled House Of The Dragon is currently in the works, set to debut on HBO in 2020, after it was reported that plans for a Naomi Watts-fronted spin-off had been shelved earlier this year.
