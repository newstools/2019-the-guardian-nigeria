 Radical77  The Afrobeat rising star returns to close out the year, with the hugely anticipated Moe Musa directed the music video for his latest hit single titled Boom Boom, a track off his third album, which is scheduled to be released next year. Nicknamed Radical by his mother because of his tenacity, perseverance and extraordinary will to live, having survived a childhood virus, poison, ran over by a heavy-duty truck and pronounced dead at the scene but was revived at the morgue. “The Radical came from my mum due to my way of seeing things differently and standing my ground from my childhood,” he said. For his infectious sound and uplifting lyrics, tastemakers across Africa and the UK including the likes of Wazobia FM, Cool FM, Beat FM London, Colourful Radio, Soundcity TV, Hip TV, Capital Xtra, NTV Uganda, and Magic One Uganda, among others have championed the rapper. Speaking on the inspiration behind the new hit, Radical77 said, “Boom Boom is a lovers tune, it’s inspired by a girl I met, with whom I took things further; it’s about the everyday things lovers do together.” “You meet someone and you’re both attracted to each other, which obviously leads to some sexual tension, and we tried to capture that in the music video. It’s a fun sensual love song, which I hope, will captivate the listeners,” he added. On what makes him unique as an artiste, the singer states: “I sing for the people; it’s mostly about the lyrics, the catchy hooks and the message I intend to deliver.” Despite a degree and career in Counselling and Psychology, Radical77, honed his craft as a rapper. “I started out as a poet, performing before fellow school mates. A professor at my university encouraged me to try rap, as my style suits and can be likened to more conscious-styled rap.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
