 Hajj  Alhaji Mohammed Tunde-Jimoh, the Executive Secretary of the Board, stated this in Ilorin on Monday, shortly after a meeting with Hajj coordinators from the 16 local government areas of the state. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the meeting, which was also attended by Hajj registration officers across the state, was aimed at reappraising Hajj activities in 2019 and preparation for the 2020 Hajj operation. The Executive Secretary said the disqualification of intending Pilgrims without clean certificates of  health was to save them from the rigours during the Hajj rites that could worsen their conditions or lead to death. He advised individuals, groups or organisations intending to sponsor pilgrims to the 2020 Hajj to be sure of their health status in the interest of the beneficiaries. “The Board will not process traveling documents of any intending Pilgrims to 2020 Hajj exercise found not to be medically fit or confirmed to be afflicted with one ailment or the other,” he said. Tunde-Jimoh explained that the development followed the decision of the Saudi Arabia authority to no longer be responsible for the care of sick pilgrims brought into their country. He advised aged persons among the intending Pilgrims to make arrangements for a relation to accompany them and to care for them while in the holy land. Tunde-Jimoh also appealed to Hajj coordinators and registration officers in the local councils, to be honest with their clients and allow the fear of God to guide their dealings with the intending pilgrims.
