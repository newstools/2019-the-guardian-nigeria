Meanwhile, following an ankle injury to Hong Kong China’s Wong Chun Ting, Africa’s top seed, Quadri Aruna, has been given the nod to take his place at the Chengdu Airlines International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) Men’s World Cup holding between November 29th and December 1. Quadri’s appearance in Chengdu will afford the 31-year-old Nigerian the opportunity to compete in the group stage of the competition. It will be recalled that the World Cup in Chengdu will be Quadri’s fifth appearance. The 2014 edition in Düsseldorf saw Quadri recording a landmark in the table tennis when he got to the quarter-final stage of the competition, which is the highest by any African.
