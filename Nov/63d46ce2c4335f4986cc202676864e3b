Larry Gaaga who recently released his ‘Living In Bondage: Breaking Free’ Soundtrack album has now released the music video to the track, Tene. The track is off the newly released project and features celebrated highlife musician, Flavour Nabania. Sampling scenes from the film, the video sees a shirtless Flavour singing in the rain and his drenched love interest is also seen in the rain. In other scenes, the lovebirds are seen cosying in bed as they express their affection for each other. Flavour doesn’t disappoint as he gives us some of his famous waist twisting moves.
