Towards creating sustainable and livable cities and communities, the Lagos State Government has expressed readiness to begin the regeneration of Ilasan estate and other parts of the state.
 
The programme, The Guardian learned would involve reconstruction of dilapidated structures and repair of rundown infrastructure, which are no longer safe for further human utilisation. 
 
Lagos state Commissioner for Housing, Hon. Moruf Akinderu-Fatai who disclosed this in the review of the activities of the ministry last week explained that the regeneration of Ilasan and other parts of the state was in line with sustainable development goal SDG 11 which is focused on creating sustainable and livable cities and communities. He disclosed that about 400 residents that would be directly affected by the reconstruction would be temporarily relocated to one of the state-owned schemes, which will soon be completed. Akinderu-Fatai explained further that the decision is based on the need to set good standards of sustainability for future generations of Lagosians. He said: “ In regenerating the estate, we will also take cognizance of access to quality education, health facilities, efficient public transportation, refuse collection services, sewage, human safety, and good air quality, among other things.” “Furthermore, along with other ministries and agencies of the state, ministry of housing will work towards promoting a robust neighborhood life through the availability of structures that encourage community activities,” he added. He also noted that further habitation in Ilasan is dangerous and injurious to healthy living hence the state government is determined to intervene by reconstructing the estate as soon as possible. The future of the state, he said, is very important hence we must make the right decisions today in order to bequeath a legacy of sustainability to the generations yet unborn.
