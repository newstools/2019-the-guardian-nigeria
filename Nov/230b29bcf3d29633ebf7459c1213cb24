A Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Charles Oko Enya, who recently filed a suit at the Federal High Court, Abakaliki, seeking the removal of the constitutional clause barring President Muhammadu Buhari and governors from seeking a third term in office, has said he would not be intimidated by any threat of expulsion or arrest from his party or any other source. He stated that his desire for the removal of the term limits for President Buhari was in national interest, stressing that his anti-corruption efforts should be allowed to consolidate or else the country would face regression. Enya was reacting to a statement from the national leadership of the APC last Thursday, where the party threatened to expel him over the suit. APC National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Issa-Onilu, who signed the statement had disclosed that investigations were ongoing to ascertain the true membership of Enya after which he would be expelled from the party. But in a statement personally signed and made available to The Guardian in Enugu, yesterday, Enya stated that he was a loyal member of the party, adding that no person or group sponsored him to institute the suit.He said: “I wish to state that having approached the court, it is left for the court to rule on the suit. I restate my intention to abide by the court’s decision on the matter, although hopeful that it will be in line with the submission of my counsel. “Let me also add that I will never be intimidated by any threat of expulsion, arrest or any other untoward action from any person or group of persons, as I sincerely believe that the President’s anti-corruption efforts should be allowed to consolidate, otherwise Nigeria will regress back to the locust years of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
