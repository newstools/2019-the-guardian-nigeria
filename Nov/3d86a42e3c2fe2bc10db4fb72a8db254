Vector Blasts MTN For Unsatisfactory Service | Image: Youtube With scars fresh off the MI-Vector rap battle that rocked the Nigerian music industry just about a month ago, rapper Vector tha Viper has now found a new combatant to go up against – MTN Nigeria from whom he demands a better service. Vector, whose birth name is Olanrewaju Ogunmefun, took to his Twitter page to call out MTN Nigeria for offering “crap” services. Apparently, the rapper was dissatisfied with MTN data service and was not interested in being placated by the rep that attended to him on Twitter. “@MTN180 @MTNNG you guys think it’s okay to treat the people who spammed [spend] money on your business like crap? There are other networks true but you will do right by the people you take money from. You will respect the people you just wait and see. #MTNdoBETTER.” In a series of tweets, the “#JudasTheRat” rapper further reiterated his displeasure with the company: “Some of us work for every penny we spend. You are in my dm telling to chill and nothing is done and the data finished. What stupid data finished? The one we didn’t really use? You will no bully anyone into accepting the substandard. #MTNdoBETTER.” “We are a country of young vibrant people who must work our ways ourselves. The internet has become the new world and you claim to provide services that is clearly not working as majority have always complained about your services. #MTNdoBETTER” “The new business age is heavy on data usage and you are also 3rd trimester heavy the pressure your network puts on people in a Country where life is harder than your connection connecting these days. You will give them what they deserve. Especially if they pay for it #MTNdoBETTER” It appears that a white flag is in sight as Vector is in a conversation with an MTN rep as at the time of this writing: “So I am taking to a rep on the phone right now and the network is going in and out. This is just sad.”
