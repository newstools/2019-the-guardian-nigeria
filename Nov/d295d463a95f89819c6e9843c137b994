For allegedly importing 120,000 brands of substandard electric cables in 13 containers, a Federal High Court, Lagos yesterday remanded in police custody, a businessman, Ifeanyi Okoli. Justice Nicholas Oweibo made the order following Okoli’s arraignment by the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) on a three-count charge of conspiracy and importation of substandard goods. Okoli’s sole co-defendant in the suit marked FHC/1/388/2019, is Natures Breeze Ltd. The SON alleged that Okoli, 34, of No 5, Igbeyin Adun Street, Shibiri, Lagos, and Natures Breeze of the same address, committed the offence on or about October 31, 2019 and at the latter’s warehouse. Prosecution counsel, Babatunde Alajogun said both defendants conspired to import “about 120,000 different brands of substandard electric cables in 13 containers which did not comply with the Standards Organisation of Nigeria Mandatory Industrial Standard before importation”. The offences, Alajogun added, contravened Section 516 of the Criminal Code Act, 2004. Count One of the three-count charge reads: “That you Ifeanyi Okoli, 34 years, of No. 5, Igbeyin Adun Street, Shibiri, and Nature’s Breeze of No 5, Igbeyin Adun Street Shibiri on or about 31st day of October, 2019, while at a warehouse at No 5 Igbeyin Adun Street, Shibiri, did conspire to ‘commit a felony to wit: imported about 120,000 different brands of substandard electric cables in 13 containers which did not comply with the Standards Organisation of Nigeria Mandatory Industrial Standard before importation and thereby committed an offence contrary to Sections 516, 26(2)(b)(iii) and (3)(a) of the Criminal Code Act CAP C39 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004 and punishable under the same Section.” Okoli pleaded not guilty.
