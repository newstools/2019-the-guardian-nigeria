 The Access Bank Lagos City Marathon has been elevated to a silver label race.  IAAF Head of Road Races, Alessio Punzi, conveyed the elevation of the Lagos City Marathon from a bronze label to a silver label a few weeks ago. Olopade, who is the Chief Executive Officer of Nilayo Sports Management, organisers of the Access Bank Lagos City Marathon, told The Guardian yesterday that the attainment of the silver label would spur them to do more. “As the race promoter and organiser, I am still in celebration mood, and I must thank the Nigerian media for the support. I must say also that the feat would not have been possible without the backing of the Lagos State Government.” The maiden edition of the Lagos City Marathon in 2016 recorded about 50,000 participants, but the number increased to over 100,000 participants at the last edition held in February this year. The organisers are already preparing for the 2020 edition. Olopade thanked the Lagos State government for wholly believing in the noble idea and for offering full support financially, technically and in terms of security and logistics since inception. He also expressed gratitude to the headline sponsor, Access Bank for its open-door policy and embracing the marathon, just as he commended other partners like 7Up, Bet9Ja, Kia Motors, Revolution Plus and Eko Atlantic for their supportive roles in the past years. Meanwhile, Olopade, a former sports commissioner in Ogun State, says the next target for the Access Bank Lagos City Marathon is to go for gold and then the platinum label, which is the highest award by the global body.
