Hundreds of Children who lost their parents to Boko Haram terrorists yesterday hosted police detective, Abba Kyari, who visited them.  The purpose of his visit was to motivate and encourage them to work hard. The orphans are kept in a facility owned by El-kanemi College Of Islamic Theology in Maiduguri, Borno State. The Guardian learnt that the officer visited their classes, hostels and had discussions with their teachers and matrons. According to him, “I have seen and learnt a lot today by my visit. “I spoke to the orphans at length, encouraged and motivated them to study and strive very hard. I also told them that as human beings, they have equal chances of achieving their dreams in life just like many other orphans and non-orphans have become in life”.
