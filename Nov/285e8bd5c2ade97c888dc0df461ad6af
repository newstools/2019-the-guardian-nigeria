Court of Appeals sitting in Ibadan, Oyo State, has faulted the ruling of the Oyo State Governorship Election Tribunal. Justice Yahaya, the lead judge of the four-man panel, on Monday declared that there was a miscarriage of justice by the tribunal and thatÂ  the right to fair hearing of the All Progressive Congress governorship candidate Bayo Adelabu was breached. Yahaya held that the documents tendered by the appellants ought to have guided the tribunal through proper investigation, stressing that the pieces of evidence were also not adequately evaluated. The panel, however, affirmed the victory of Makinde of the Peoples Democratic Party in the Oyo State governorship election. It upheld the decision of the tribunal, which declared Makinde as the winner of the March 9 poll, in a unanimous judgement delivered Yahaya.
