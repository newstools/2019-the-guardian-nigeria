 Zidiq  Directed by Michel Dessources Jr, the video tunefully applauds the irresistible beauty of the African woman known for a beautiful face, external elegance of shape, great hair and smooth skin. A perfect mix of both the physical and internal beauty, the addictive jam is defined by its fusion of Caribbean and dancehall vibe laced with lively electronic soundscapes. Commenting on the visual, Zidiq said, “the director and I wanted to present the video as a stylish colorful, high energy montage of a mix of performances and drama, which has its elements edited together to create a stunning look of a well-told story using interesting camera angles and lightings.” The camera work accentuates each woman and highlights the uniformed dance routine taking place beneath the glossy neon lights of the club. The satisfactorily tuneful song is produced and mixed by Irish producers Brian Sheil and Alex Flood. Poised to establish a fierce position in the electronic music sphere, customizing it with cultural influences and preparing future projects, Zidiq enjoys a wide array of music, as he showed his admiration for the vocal prowess of Wande Coal, the energetic vibes of Burna Boy, as well as the royal swaggz of the queen of house music, Niniola. African Mama is the first of its kind not just Nigeria but the African music scene as a whole. A perfect blend of the widely accepted Afro sound garnished with the energetic electro dance music tune called ‘Afro Electronic Dance Music’.
