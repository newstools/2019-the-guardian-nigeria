Governor Emeka Ihedioha of Imo State has promised to ensure that under his watch, the Land of Hope did not take loan to finance any project. The governor disclosed this at his private residence in Owerri while briefing journalists on his six-month-old administration. He maintained that unlike the immediate past administration, he would utilise the resources available to him judiciously. “I will take no loans to develop Imo State, though I inherited an epileptic state; the worst-run state in the country,” he said. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governor, whose mandate has been ratified by the election petition tribunal and Court of Appeal, said the state was so bad before he became governor, explaining that there was total collapse of infrastructure. “I noticed devastation in the land. Imo had the highest number of Garnishee Court Orders in the country. “Before I came in, judges in the state were owed 36 months. Their cars were not serviced for years. “The Chief Judge lives in his private residence. The Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the House of Assembly have no official residence. “As we speak, the Ministry of Works has advised that we evacuate members of the House of Assembly from the complex because of the bad state of the building.” On his achievements so far, he pointed at his efforts to revive agriculture. “Avutu Poultry Farm will soon be revived, as well as Adapalm, though there are litigations surrounding them,” he added.
