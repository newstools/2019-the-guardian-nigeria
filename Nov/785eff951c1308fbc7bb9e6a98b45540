The Governorship candidate of the Allied Peoples Movement (APM) in Ogun State, Adekunle Akinlade, yesterday declared his readiness to approach the Supreme Court, to contest the result of the March 9, 2019 Gubernatorial election in the state. Akinlade, who disclosed this while addressing representatives of the party from the 57 Local Governments and Local Council Development Areas at the party secretariat, Abiola Way, Leme, Abeokuta, said he was sure of victory at the Supreme Court. While expressing his conviction and belief in the legal system, Akinlade, however, asked his supporters to remain calm and resolute as the party takes his case to the Supreme court. Akinlade had dragged Governor Dapo Abiodun of All Progressives Congress (APC) before the Appeal Court, sitting in Ibadan, which upheld the decision of the governorship election petition tribunal, in favour of Abiodun. The Justice Yusuf Halilu-led governorship election petition tribunal had on September 14 dismissed Akinlade’s petition; declaring Abiodun as the winner of the March 9 election. Upholding the decision of the lower tribunal, the Appeal Court on November 11 also dismissed the petition. But Akinlade, who is undeterred with this, said the decision was unanimously agreed by elders and leaders of the APM, whom he said met at the weekend for a review of the entire process. “Our conviction and believe in the legal system is unshaken despite the two previous judgments. On November 15, 2019, elders and leaders across the state met and unanimously agreed that we must approach the Supreme Court to test the strength of our case,” Akinlade stated.
