The actor who filed for divorce in late 2017 from his now ex-wife, Sheletta Chapital, has completed the divorce process. However, the two are still good friends, TMZ reports. Even though it is still unclear why things went south between them, the pair are said to be in good terms. Mackie married Chapital, his reported childhood sweetheart, at a low-key wedding back in 2014; it looks like he followed the same model on the way out too. They both met when they were seven-years-old in New Orleans, before embarking on an on-off relationship since grade school. While they did briefly split, the pair rekindled their romance when the actor was helping to rebuild houses in New Orleans in 2009. They since maintained a very quiet relationship profile. Mackie and Chapital share four kids together.
