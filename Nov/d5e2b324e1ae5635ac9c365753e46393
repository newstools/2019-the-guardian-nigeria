 Prof. Charles Dokubo  Beneficiaries of the professional development course drawn from communities in the Niger Delta were trained at the Onshore and Offshore Safety Institute of Nigeria in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, as part of fresh initiatives to extend gains of the amnesty programme to inhabitants of communities impacted during the Niger Delta crisis. Co-ordinator of the Presidential Amnesty Programme, Prof. Charles Dokubo, while presenting certificates of the institute to the beneficiaries at a ceremony in Abonnema, Akuku Toru Local Council of Rivers State, said it signalled the commencement of implementation of a robust action plan for the training and empowerment of youths in the Niger Delta. “The presidential amnesty programme under my watch will ensure aggressive engagement of youths in the Niger Delta to achieve sustainable peace and development in line with President Muhammadu Buhari’s vision for the region. I am determined to ensure that gains of the amnesty programme extend beyond beneficiaries enlisted in the programme to youths in the crisis-impacted communities.” Dokubo, who expressed joy with the certification of the 500 youths after training, said they were now fit for engagement in all sectors of the economy, particularly the oil sector, as they had acquired broad training in health, safety and environment. Meanwhile, speaking on behalf of beneficiaries of the training, 30-year-old Bobmanuel Fabiawari Merima commended President Muhammadu Buhari and Dokubo for inspiring the people of Niger Delta with youths’ empowerment programmes. “We thank them for sponsoring us for this intensive professional development programme at the end of which we were awarded Health, Safety and Environment Level One, Two and Three certificates. With this, I can fight fire, manage waste, issue work permit, identify hazardous areas and manage environmental safety,” she said.
