There is excitement in the air, as the date for the launch of Africa’s first indigenous teen channel gets closer. On December 1, 2019 at the Balmoral Hall, Federal Palace Hotel, Lagos, Teen Africa TV, a brainchild of Charles Novia who’s the Founder/CEO, will launch with a bang.
According to Novia,  “Teen Africa TV is the biggest indigenous visual ecosystem for Teenagers in this part of the world. We speak the language of the Teens and we understand what they want. Our programmes are borne from research by them and all our original programmes have teens and young adults as presenters. We have given them their own world and there is nothing like this.” He said, “the TATV presenters and brand ambassadors are some of the best teen talents in the country and we are very proud of them. We have assembled the next breakout youth talents who will take over the entertainment scene in Africa and the world in a few years and TATV is the natural springboard for these talents to ‘blow’.” After the launch, Teen Africa TV will be on DSTV and Gotv as a 24 hour daily channel with the best original content for the teens and family audience. It was  gathered  that the opening performance on December 1, which will be aired,  Tuface Idibia, the teen favourites Joeboy and Crayon as well as other teen acts from the TATV performing ensemble are expected  to be  on parade
