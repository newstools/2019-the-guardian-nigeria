Chilli Con Car| Photo Miles Tea and Coffee Nothing gives me joy like having international cuisine replicas in Nigerian cuisine. It gives this sense of balanced equation in comparison to international food either by accidental imitation or an old fusion of culture. A lot of cuisines are inter-related all thanks to globalisation and migration. This is also the case of our popular beans and corn pottage as against the American Chilli con Carne. In as much as chilli con Carne is just a little upgrade of our beans and corn, it is easy to upgrade our “ewa and agbado” by simply adding fish or meat as well just to be at par with Chilli con Carne. After all, chilli con Carne is an upgrade of chilli sin Carne-this is made without the beef. I have always chosen chilli con Carne over our beans and corn. In the absence of corn, the dish still holds its unique and exquisite taste as opposed to beans and corn that will change course and become just beans pottage. Here is the recipe for Chilli con Carne. This recipe serves 4 persons. Ingredients Method
