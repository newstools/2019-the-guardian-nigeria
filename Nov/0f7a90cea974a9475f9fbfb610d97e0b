Adam Sandler’s Acting Professor Told Him To Quit. PHOTO: Variety “Uncut Gems” actor Adam Sandler and “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” actor Brad Pitt sat down for a chat for the cover of “Variety Studio: Actors on Actors”. During the course of the conversation, Sandler confirmed the story of how his acting Professor at the New York University had discouraged from acting and rather advised him to pursue another career path. Pitt narrated the story he first heard from director Bennett Miller: “You were at NYU, and it was your acting coach, or acting professor, I believe. He took you out for a beer and he kindly said to you, ‘Think about something else. Listen, you got heart, but you don’t have it. Choose another path.'” Brad continued: “There’s a second part to this story. This is why it’s my favorite Adam Sandler story, and I think it says a lot about you. “That you ran into him at your height, when you’re getting the ultimate payday, and you’re with a bunch of friends, out at a bar. “Anyone would think that’s the opportunity where you rub it in his face. And reportedly, what you did was you introduced him to your friends, and you said: “This is the only teacher to ever buy me a beer.” True?’ Sandler replied, “Yeah.” Some of the films Sandler has featured in include Billy Madison (1995), the sports comedies Happy Gilmore (1996) and The Waterboy (1998), the romantic comedy The Wedding Singer (1998), Big Daddy (1999), Mr. Deeds (2002), Grown Ups (2010), Grown Ups 2 (2013) and voicing Dracula in the Hotel Transylvania franchise (2012–2018). “Variety Studio: Actors on Actors” is an Emmy Award-winning series that highlights the best TV and movie performances of the year. The issue will hit newsstands Nov. 12.
