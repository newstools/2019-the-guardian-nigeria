Scientists have recorded a major breakthrough in their efforts to eradicate the Ebola Virus Disease with the prequalification of worldâ€™s first Ebola vaccine by the World Health Organisation (WHO), a key step in speeding up its licensing, access, and use in countries most at risk of Ebola outbreaks. This is the fastest vaccine approval process ever to have been conducted by the global agency.	Also as part of efforts to increase treatment for diabetes in low- and middle-income countries and boost access to cheaper life-saving insulin for diabetics, the WHO yesterday announced the commencement of a pilot programme to prequalify human insulin. The decision, announced ahead of World Diabetes Day (November 14), is part of a series of steps WHO is taking to address the growing diabetes burden in all regions by increasing the flow of quality-assured products in the international market and providing countries with greater choice and patients with lower prices.
