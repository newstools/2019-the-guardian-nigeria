Many social media users have been left stupefied after the photo of a woman’s corpse standing at her own funeral surfaced online. The image was shared by a Twitter user who goes by the handle @Stravensky7. Sharing the image of the corpse, he captioned: dead woman Andaris Palulun is given new clothes by his brother Ferri before returning to the family tomb. He died 20 years ago. | Claudio Sieber Several months after internment the body is exhumed and the skull removed, oiled, polished, and offered tobacco and food. After the remainder of the body is re-interred, traditional islanders keep the skull on a shelf in their home and believe the native god Nakaa welcomes the dead person’s spirit in the northern end of the islands. Another good example is a Viking funeral that sees the Viking funeral with the body laid out on the deck of a dragon ship, floating into the sunset while warriors fire flaming arrows to ignite the pyre.

The person’s belongings and food were placed beside them. Men took their weapons to the next world, while women were laid to rest wearing their finest jewelry and accessories. If the deceased was a nobleman or great warrior, his woman was passed from man to man in his tribe, who all made love to her (some would say raped) before strangling her and placing her next to the body of her man.
