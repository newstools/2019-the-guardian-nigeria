Statistics show that one female in South Africa is killed every three hours and each day 137 sexual offences are committed. The past few months have seen a swelling outcry against gender violence, sparked by a string of shocking murders. Ramaphosa lambasted the scourge as “a great shame on our nation”. He vowed to crack down on perpetrators after “femicide” protests flared across the country in September, setting aside 1.6 billion rand ($108 million/98 million euros) for a six-month emergency plan. The plan is meant to improve access to justice for survivors, carry out prevention campaigns to change attitudes and behaviour, and create economic opportunities for women who are vulnerable to abuse. Government is opening more specialised Sexual Offences Courts across the country to expedite trials and police stations are being equipped with more rape evidence collection kits.
