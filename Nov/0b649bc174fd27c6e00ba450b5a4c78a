4 Signs You Need A Break From Your Relationship. Photo: The Praying Woman One can’t overstress the fact that there is no such thing as a perfect relationship. All relationships go through rough times. For some, these rough times are mild and can be easily resolved, for others, the relationship is threatened and they quickly decide on a breakup. Mind you, taking a break is not the same as a breakup. When you begin to find yourself wondering whether or not the relationship is right for you on a regular basis, maybe all you need is to take some time off to re-evaluate the relationship. In case, you are not sure whether or not to take a break from your relationship, here are four things to consider: Constant Fight Are you always arguing and fighting over everything? It is really annoying when you and your partner always seem to be at the opposite end of every issue. You don’t seem to understand each other, neither are you both ready to compromise. No Strong Connection Love and attraction may cover up for a lot of things but only for a while. After some time, the veil begins to drop then you realize that what you both share is not enough to last. Many confuse attraction and passion for qualities that make a relationship last. Doubts Do you find yourself having doubts about the relationship? Do you find yourself wondering if you still want to be with your partner or not? A break would give you and your partner space and time to figure out if the relationship is still important to you. You Have Been Cheated On Not everybody handles a cheating partner the same way. You may choose to forgive and move on. You may also decide to take a break from the relationship, especially if your partner is a serial cheater.
