PHOTO: LUCY LADIDI ATEKO  The Federal High Court had on October 4 granted Sowore and the second defendant, Olawale Bakare, bail on conditions they had applied to be varied because they considered them stringent. While the defendants were expected to be released from the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS), the judge, however, denied an application for adjournment by Mr. Falana, ordering the continuation of trial. The prosecution was then asked to call the first prosecution witness (PW1).Although the defense counsel had argued that the defense was at a disadvantage because the DSS had refused access to defendants to prepare their case. He therefore sought an adjournment to allow the defence take full instructions from Sowore so they can be fully prepared for the trial, adding that he had practically been declared persona non grata at the DSS premises. The prosecution counsel though countered, maintaining that Falana never went to the DSS office and therefore, was not denied access.The SAN recalled that Justice Taiwo Taiwo granted bail on September 24 which the secret police did not obey.He said he went to serve the bail papers on the DSS DG but he was allegedly denied access while others were given audience while he sat in the reception. Falana also said the prosecution had applied to the court for witnesses to be recorded behind a screen.The prosecution had allegedly also made plans to swap the position of the dock and witness box to protect them. The set up had been reportedly dismantled by the time the judge came in and Justice Ojukwu summoned the DCR’s rep to explain what had happened.In his defence, the prosecution said only ‘administrative’ arrangements and not judicial were made Consequently, the matter was adjourned to December 5 and 6, 2019.
