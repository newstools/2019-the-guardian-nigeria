Distributing the birds and other items, the Chief Executive Officer of Norgem Nigeria Limited, Mrs. Norman Nwoga, urged the beneficiaries to ensure the birds are well fed and given proper treatment as prescribed by the veterinary doctors. According to her, the five-week-old chicks would survive in favourable conditions with economic benefits, disclosing that the effort came from Amo Farm Sieberer Hatchery (AFSH). She noted that the choice of Imo State was strategic in ensuring that the enthusiasm demonstrated by the female indigent poultry farmers was sufficiently encouraged through the donation of the birds, as a contribution to eradicating poverty in the land. Nwoga said other parts of the state, would benefit from the programme during the second phase. The Imo State representative of the firm, Peace Opara, traced the advent of the chickens (local and higher birds -half cast) to six years ago when the United Nations introduced it due to lack of nutrients among the rural women, with the recommendation of white meat and eggs for consumption.
