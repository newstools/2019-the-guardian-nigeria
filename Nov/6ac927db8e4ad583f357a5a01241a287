 President Buhari  In other words, the world is the presidential administrative space. The ruling party’s national chairman, oblivious of our immediate historical impasse re-echoed Andoakaa’s infamous statement in a fit of historical amnesia. In his words, “I think by signing the bill into law at the Nigerian House in London, it shows that where the President is, he is presiding over Nigeria and with the benefit of modern technology. We have passed the Mongo Park era…So, signing it in London for me has also made several statements. Namely, that where ever national interest is involved, the President is on duty and wherever he is he is presiding.” Apart from this, it was argued for the effect that if the president was abroad and signed a document in so far as it was performed in the embassy precincts, it would perhaps have the force of law or some validity.  Finally, it will be interesting to note what the dateline of the law reads. In other words, was the law signed in Nigeria or United Kingdom? If a wrong thing had been done in the United Kingdom, the president’s men should swallow their pride and vanity and get Nigeria’s leader to sign a proper bill into law inside Nigeria.
