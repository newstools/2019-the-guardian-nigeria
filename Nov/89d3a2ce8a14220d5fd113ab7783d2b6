The Senate yesterday swore in Abiodun Christine Olujimi representing Ekiti South after the Independent National Electoral Commission issued her Certificate of Return. The Court of Appeal in Kaduna had affirmed the judgment of the election petitions tribunal declaring Olujimi of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) winner of the 2019 National Assembly election in Ekiti State. The court also nullified the victory of Dayo Adeyeye, the former spokesperson for the Senate.President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, congratulated Olujimi who was the Minority Leader in the Eighth Senate, saying: “With this, we now have eight very solid female senators. We pray that this addition will bring additional productivity and stability to the Senate. “I will call for unity, of course we should remain focused and do only those things that will make our country great.”The other women senators include Stella Odua (PDP, Anambra North), Rose Oko (PDP, Cross River North), Oluremi Tinubu (APC, Lagos Central) and Aishatu Dahiru (APC, Adamawa Central). Others are Uche Ekwunife (PDP, Anambra Central), Betty Apiaffi (PDP, Rivers Central) and Akon Eyakemi (PDP, Akwa Ibom South).
