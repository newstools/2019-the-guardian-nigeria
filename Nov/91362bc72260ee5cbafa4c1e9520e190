 Former Arsenal boss, Arsene Wenger.

Kovac’s assistant Hansi Flick has taken over as interim coach as Bayern search for a more permanent replacement, with club president Uli Hoeness saying on Tuesday they expected to name Kovac’s successor by November 23. However they have been publicly rebuffed by both Paris Saint-Germain boss Thomas Tuchel and Ajax’s Erik ten Hag, who said on Monday he would be staying with the Dutch champions until at least the end of the season.
