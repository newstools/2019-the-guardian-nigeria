Chairman, Nigerian Governors’ Forum (NGF), Dr. Kayode Fayemi; Bayelsa State governor, Seriake Dickson; and business mogul, Arthur Eze, will grace the public presentation of The Powers That Be: Thoughts and Reflections on People, Power and Politics, a book authored by the Managing Director/Editor-in-Chief of The Sun Publishing Limited, Onuoha Ukeh. While Governor Fayemi of Ekiti State will chair the event that will hold on Monday, November 25 in Abuja, Dickson, and Eze will be chief presenters. According to Ukeh, a former employee of The Guardian, the book is his views on the socio-political and economic development of Nigeria. “The book is simply the story of Nigeria and the world written over the years as they happened. It is the view of a critical journalist/columnist who is both disappointed and satisfied with the conducts of people in government and corridors of power,” Ukeh added.
