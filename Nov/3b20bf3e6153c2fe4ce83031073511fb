Nigeria’s electoral body in Kogi State has declared 30 staff posted to Olamaboro Local Government Area (LGA) missing. The LGA officer-in-charge of collating and announcing the local government’s results, Garba Mahmood, said they were reported missing after the observation of some police officers who raised concern that they were last seen shortly after voting ended at 2 p.m. on Saturday. Mahmood said repeated calls to their telephone numbers did not go through. A lot of the ad-hoc staff INEC employ for elections are serving members of the National Youth Service Corps. They were declared missing around 1 a.m. on Sunday during the final collation of results in the local government. Subsequently, the results of the LGA has been declared missing.
