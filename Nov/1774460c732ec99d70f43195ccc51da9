Experts that gathered at the just concluded 2019 FMDQ Nigerian Capital market Conference in Lagos, at the weekend, underscored the need for sector regulators to ensure that the nation’s financial system is well positioned. The positioning, according to them, would be in such a manner that identification and settlement of all traded securities in the market become seamless by investors in line with global best practice. Beside easy identification of securities, they also hinged a functional market on the creation of a flexible market structure that would guarantee easy entry and exit. The stakeholders, therefore, identified Central Counter Party (CCP) as a crucial market infrastructure, stressing the need for regulators to create a robust regulatory framework around the instrument and make it more resilient as a navigator of risks.

They want to see a market that is highly regulated with relatively stable forex market,” she said. The Chief Executive Officer of Granite Central Securities and Depository, South Africa, Leone Rossouw, said infrastructure in South African market is so robust that it is a driving force in the financial market. He said the CCP market is currently generating high level of liquidity and investors’ confidence for the market. “In building CCP infrastructure, we involved professionals that have vast knowledge oh how deep a financial market should be. “Most importantly, you must follow international best practice in CCP. You need to lower the cost of capital with international standard. You also need high concentration to lower your risks,” he said. Also contributing, the Deputy Director and Head Registration, Exchanges, Market infrastructure and Innovation Department of the Securities and Exchange Commission Nigeria, Emomotimi Agama, said all participants in CCP must work together in agreement to give confidence to clients that CCP in Nigeria is in line with international best practice. He pointed out that Nigerian financial system must identify various elements that would help attract participants and funds into the nation’s CCP. “CCP is a very important market infrastructure, We are working to create regulation that is robust.
