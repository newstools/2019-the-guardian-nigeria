If you are a Lagosian and you have that “owambe” spirit, you must know you have to dress to kill at any event you are going for especially, this festive season. Apart from jollof rice and a bottle of good wine, another important thing for Nigerian owambe is that outfit that screams comfort and class. Hence, it was not a surprise to see the gorgeous fashion statement being made at the Moet and Chandon “life in pink” party. The party held at a secret location with the “1 per cent of the 1%”, the creme de la creme of the society, “the real Lagosians” in attendance. The colour code was pink and black and never has justice been done to that combination as much as the guests did. They slayed in their different outfits and it is totally difficult to give the award of best dressed to any of the attendees. Below are some of the spectacular and best dressed for the party: Which is the best dressed to you and which style are you using for your “Detty December Parte After Parte” mood?
