Ghanaian music star, Nana Richard Abiona, better known by his stage name Fuse ODG has followed up his new single, ‘Osu’ with a music video. On the song, the ‘Antenna’ hitmaker teamed up with fellow Ghanaian artist, Toyboi who also happens to be from Osu, Accra. The song is about the experiences of a sex worker who has to take to the streets of Osu after suffering abuse from her father. Located about three kilometres east of the central business district, Osu is a neighborhood in central Accra, Ghana, known for its busy commercial, restaurant and nightlife activity. It is locally known as the “West End” of Accra. The music video opens with some vixens acting as commerical sex workers getting ready for a night’s work. From a catfight, huddling together in one taxi to lining up on the streets to peddle their trade, the women give a glimpse into the lives of prostitutes. The women vie for the attention of customers who check them out before making their selection of pleasure for the night. Toyboi takes the second verse and brings his own style of rap to the song by infusing a native flow. Watch the video below:
