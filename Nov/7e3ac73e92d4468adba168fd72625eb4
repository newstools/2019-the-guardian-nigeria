The Federal High Court, Lagos has fixed December 11,2019 for the re-arraignment of a former speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Adeyemi Ikuforiji, and his aide, Oyebode Atoyebi. The pair are facing 54-count charge of money laundering to the tune of N600 million.The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) is trying the duo for allegedly misappropriated the sum belonging to the legislature. Justice Mohammed Liman fixed the date yesterday after the defence counsel, Mr. Tunde Akinrinmisi, prayed for an adjournment. The prosecuting counsel, Rotimi Oyedepo, while grudgingly conceding to the adjournment, lamented that, “this is a case that the prosecution has given evidence and closed its case but Justice Ibrahim Buba discharged the defendants on no-case submission, which travelled from here up to the Supreme Court. Here we are six years after.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
