The Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA) said it has expelled six students for assaulting a fellow student. “The expulsion is in line with the position of Page 48 of the 2019/2020 Students Handbook which prescribes expulsion from the University for Students who engage in physical assault or battery on another student outside the university premises,” FUTA spokesman Adegbenro Adebanjo said in a statement. “As a consequence of their expulsion, their studentship of FUTA ceases forthwith with all its rights and privileges.” The school temporarily suspended the students- Popoola Olaniyi, Oluwadare Faith, Nandi Jessica, Ajuwon Emmanuella, Emmanuel Taiwo and Alao Cecilia for physically assaulting the student on Saturday, November 17. One of the expelled students recorded the assault and posted it on social media. In the viral video, two of the students slapped and flogged the victim with objects. The victim pleaded but was ignored. Adebanjo thereafter said the university would not tolerate indiscipline or any act that contravened its rules and regulations. “At the conclusion of the ongoing investigations the full weight of the law of the university, as contained in the handbooks and oath of matriculation which all students are made to sign and subscribe to, will be visited on those found culpable,” Adebanjo said.
