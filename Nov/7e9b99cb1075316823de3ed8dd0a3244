As his way of celebrating his birthday, Mr P has released a brand new single titled ‘Too Late’. Too Late addresses the issue of domestic violence and calls on everyone to join in on the fight against domestic violence and protection of loved ones. The PClassic Records frontier singer brings his musical dexterity to this track that has its video directed by him while the song itself was produced by Goldswarm. ‘Too Late‘, serves as Mr P‘s third output for the year, it comes after the release of his previous record tagged ‘Karma‘. The music video starts with an abused woman crying alongside her watching daughter and messages scrolling across the screen about a need to put an end to domestic violence. An emotional Mr P bursts in but his family is gone with only the haunting memories of them. He laments being unable to tell them how much he loves them and how much they meant to him while they were there. Scenes of domestic violence are recorded in the video as Mr P plays the character of an abusive husband who is cheered on by his brothers. Ironically, the same brothers who urged him on when batters his wife treats their own wives like queens and with respect. He shoots himself in the head while crying in the rain to show the depth of his sorrow but he wakes up to realise he has been dreaming and his family is still by him. Watch the video below:
