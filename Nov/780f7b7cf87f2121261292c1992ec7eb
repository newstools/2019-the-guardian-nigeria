Lauper is recognised for her work to end LGBTQ youth homelessness in the US. The award is a partnership between the United Nations and High Note Global Initiative, which said the award has been referred to as the “Nobel Prize In Music.” Cyndi Lauper will receive the award at her Cyndi Lauper & Friends: Home for the Holidays benefit concert, which will take place at the Novo Theater in Los Angeles on December 10. Pop sensation Kesha is expected to present the award on the day that is also marked globally as Human Rights Day. “Musicians hold a special place in society, as they have the ability to inspire people to action,” UN Human Rights Chief External Outreach Laurent Sauver. “We are proud to support The High Note Global Initiative and The High Note Global Prize in an effort to galvanize global awareness of the importance of human rights, and at the same time honor artists who passionately use their work to promote and protect the rights of others.” 66-year-old Lauper is the singer of American classics such as “Girls Just Want To Have Fun” and “Time After Time”. She has two Grammy awards to her name, first of which she won in 1985 in the Best New Artist Category. The singer has also won one each of Tony, Emmy and MTV awards. Her Emmy award was for Outstanding Guest Actress In A Comedy Series.
