Security experts have cautioned secondary school students across Lagos State against cyber crime and other nefarious activities.They all noted that it is a crime against humanity. They gave the advice during a discussion with students from different secondary schools across the state, as part of the police-citizens partnership in preventing cybercrime to celebrate the National Cyber Security Awareness Month (NCSAM). The Programme, which was organised by International Center for Leadership Development Nigeria (ICLDG) in partnership with the Nigeria Policing Programme (NPP) with the theme “Own it, Secure it, Protect it”, educated the participants on the consequences of cybercrime in the society, economy and individuals. Speaking at the event, the Operations Officer in charge of Anti-Cultism Unit of Lagos State Police Command, Stephen Kuti said the aim of the programme was to enlighten the students against Internet fraud and cybercrime related activities, as it has negative consequences on the nation and individuals. He said: “ We are looking at eradicating cyber crime from the mindset of this young ones. Our aim is to impart this knowledge into them because whatever they have in their minds now is what they grow up with. From this tender age, if you can correct the impression that it is very wrong to do cybercrime related activities, then we must have gone a long way in tackling the menace before it gets out of hand. The Lagos Sate Intervention Officer, NPP, Ivy Basil-Ofili said, “It is more possible to cub the excesses of this young people now before they grow up to making decisions of their own” adding “The police can only do the work of protecting lives and properties by arresting offenders, but the duty of prosecution is left for the judiciary to handle.”She said if there were stern punishments for cybercrime offenders, the rate of crime would reduce in the society.
