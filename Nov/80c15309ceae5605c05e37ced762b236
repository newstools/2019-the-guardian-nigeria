The cabin at Ota was commissioned by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Health, Ogun State, Dr. Adesanya Ayinde, who represented the governor, Dapo Abiodun. According to the Past District 9110 Governor, Dr. Deinde Shoga, the project was initiated by Past District Governors Wale Ogunbadejo and Serdar Unlu in 2017 when the duo met at a programme in Florida, preparatory to their assumption of office as District Governors. He narrated various challenges that confronted the project, which led to the involvement of clubs in Districts 9110, 2430 and clubs in other Districts in the United States of America, Brazil and the Rotary Foundation. “Clearing of the consumables for the cabins at the port when they were shipped to Nigeria was a herculean task as customs officials refused to co-operate and believe that the items were imported on humanitarian grounds. This led to millions of naira incurred on demurrage and the delivery of the project deferred for about three years. “Commendation must go to the PDGs, Dr. Wale Ogunbadejo and Serdar Unlu who initiated the project and did not rest until its fruition as well as the their successors who also laboured gallantly towards its execution. Kudos also go to the Project Chairman, PAG Wole Kukoyi, for his relentless effort to the end and PAG Ramesh Biswal, who saved the districts a lot of money by giving free warehouse to keep the consumables after they were collected at the port,” he said. District Governor, Dr. Jide Akeredolu, while reiterating the various challenges confronted before the exercise came to fruition, commended the initiators of the project and the PDGs who also contributed to the exercise. He implored the beneficiaries to make good use of the cabins to impress the givers to do more. Ayorinde appreciated the gesture, which she said would enhance accessibility of quality healthcare delivery for the people of Ogun State.According to Shoga, other Medical Health Cabins would be donated to Taffi in Ojo Local Government; Iworo, near Badagry; Idi-Araba; Ajaganabe in Epe, Okungbolu PHC, Ifo Local Government and Oke Agbo PHC in Ijebu Igbo.
