Lions Clubs worldwide have been charged to be at the forefront of transformational change in their communities, despite economic, social and political challenges. Speaking at the investiture to install Engr. Leke Awofeso as the 38th President of Ikorodu Doyen Lions Club, the new president, who noted that the harvest is ripe but the labourers are few, said: “You can give without loving, but you cannot love without giving because of love.” Awofeso promised to take the club to greater heights, even as he gave assurance that all club projects for the less privileged in the society, would be completed within one year. Such projects, he said, include distribution of reading eyeglasses to 110 beneficiaries of Agbele-Ikoro community, a cataract operation for 12 identified members of the community and provision of potable water in three public schools in Ikorodu division, among others.
