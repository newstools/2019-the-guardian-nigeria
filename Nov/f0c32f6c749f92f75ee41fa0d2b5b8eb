Operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), Imo State Police Command have arrested alleged fake United States (US) based Nigerian, Emmanuel Obioma, 43, for obtaining money by false pretence from his online girlfriend, Ugo Emake. Two others were also arrested for allegedly belonging to the syndicate. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the state, Godson Ikeokwu, confirmed this Sunday, disclosing that the suspect allegedly worked with a syndicate, using social media to defraud their victims. According to Ikeokwu, a Superintendent of Police (SP), the prime suspect got his victim, Ugo Emake, in an online platform, fielding her with false information that he was residing in the US.
Others apprehended by the operatives in connection with the crime are Iheanacho Amanda Francisca, 22; and Agbo Samuel, 42. Ikeokwu, explained that Obioma, who had been living in Imo State, had installed a special gadget on his phone, which indicated foreign number each time he called Ugo, for discussions, adding that on one occasion, Obioma told her online girlfriend that he was traveling to Nigeria, but sadly, was involved in a ghastly auto crash that led to the death of two passengers and himself critically ill with injuries in a hospital, requiring N821, 000 for treatment. Ugo, the PPRO, said sent the said amount to Obioma, on two installments, not knowing that it was all fraud. Ikeokwu added: “on another day, the prime suspect, told her online girlfriend that he was traveling to Owerri by road, but was abducted along Kogi road, while the abductors demanded N1million ransom. “The last incident broke the camel’s back, leading to her suspicion that everything was scam. She then came to Nigeria and reported to the police about her experience, which led to the arrest of the suspects”.
