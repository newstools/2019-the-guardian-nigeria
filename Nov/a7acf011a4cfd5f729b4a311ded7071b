Organisers of one of the biggest concerts/shows in Nigeria and Africa, Warri Again, have promised to make this year’s edition bigger and better. The show, which started on October 1, 2013, in Warri, Delta State, has blossomed to become one of the best and biggest shows across the continent of Africa. Brownhill Events Inc, a creative organisation that provides excellent event solutions within and outside Delta State, is the main organising body. According to the organisers, the Warri Again concerts/shows has re-awakened and reignited the perception that Warri, one of the major oil producing cities in south-south region, is indeed peaceful and investment friendly. “The show has also portrayed the people as hospitable, warm and receptive.” Having staged the show successfully in Warri since 2013, the organisers decided to move it to Lagos in 2017. This year’s edition will be the third time in Lagos, and the 15th edition of the gig. Speaking ahead of the 2019 edition, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Brownhill Events Inc, Mrs. Julie Pinnick said: “Staging the event to Lagos became expedient because most of the amazing talents in Music and Comedy from Delta that we have been able to discover and nurture over time need such audience to test their acceptability and wider reach as well as their ingenuity. “This factor will eventually launch them into stardom and allow them to join other prominent Deltans that have made their marks in this enterprise of comedy and music such as Alibaba, AY, Bovi, Omawumi, Oritsefemi, Solid Star, Uti Nwachukwu (Big Brother Africa), I Go Dye and Harrysong,” she stated. According to Mrs. Julie Pinnick, wife of the President of Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick, past editions of Warri Again featured 90 per cent of prominent Nigerian musicians/comedians/dance groups, as well as international stars like Ja Rule, Ashanti, Awilo and Maxi Priest. Also speaking during the week, Project Director, Victor Wokocha said: “We, at Brownhill Events Inc. having participated in carnivals held in the tourist sites in some of the major cities of the world, is domesticating same in Nigeria come December 27, 2019 when a galaxy of renowned musicians, comedians and other household names in the entertainment industry will converge in the Warri Again Festival Night at the Eko Convention Centre to showcase what they know best. This is the 15th edition because each year, we do organise three or four events.” Meanwhile, Event Producer, Onye Ubanatu, has revealed that four international actors have confirmed their participation for the December 27 show in Lagos. They are Stefflon Don, Zanda Zakuza, Mad Cobra and Gyptian. “I can also confirm that we have Africa A-list actors like Davido, Burnaboy, Mayorkun, Teni, Omawumi, Timaya, Zlatan and Niniola.
