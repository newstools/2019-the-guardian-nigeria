The lawsuit was filed with the Federal Court of Australia on 22nd November of this year. Jay-Z claims that the firm has breached his intellectual property, by including his name in a children’s book titled AB to Jay-Z and also by drawing on lyrics from his hit song 99 Problems. The advertisement from the said book reads, “If you’re having alphabet problems I feel bad for you son, I got 99 problems but my ABC’s ain’t one!” Further in the back of the back cover, the book teaches letters by referring to the names of other famous rappers including Snoop Dogg and Biggie Smalls. The lawsuit by the hip-hop artiste claims the company traded on his likeness and infringed the copyright of the lyrics to 99 Problems. It was reported that Jay-Z’s lawyers requested the retailer to stop selling the products in 2018, but the situation remained unresolved. It said the business continued to “deliberately and knowingly” use his likeness in a “flagrant, glaring” way. Jay- Z whose real name is Carter Shawn is an American rapper, songwriter, producer, entrepreneur, and record executive. He is regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time. He first began his musical career after founding the record label Roc-A-Fella Records in 1995, and subsequently released his debut studio album Reasonable Doubt in 1996. The album was released to widespread critical success and solidified his standing in the music industry. He has gone onto release twelve additional albums, which have all attained generally positive critical reception and commercial success, including The Blueprint (2001) and The Black Album (2003). Jay-Z has also released the full-length collaborative albums Watch the Throne (2011) and Everything Is Love (2018) with Kanye West and wife Beyoncé, respectively.
