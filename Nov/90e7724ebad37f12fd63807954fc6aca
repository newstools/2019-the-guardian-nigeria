Lagos State Government has pledged its commitment to reduce high level of unemployment in the State, noting that deliberate employment intervention policies of the State have been impacting positively on job creation.
 
Governor, Babajide Sanwo Olu, added that tackling the scourge of underemployment and unemployment particularly among the nation’s teeming young population is vital to ensuring economic growth and development.
  
The Governor, who was represented by his Special Adviser on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Solape Hammond, at the launch of Eko Job Centre initiative in Lagos, said: “We are going to go on a business-friendly expansion of the economy where we are waking up Lagos to its potential. We are not only talking of potentials, but actualising it and people are very central to achieving this.”  The Managing Director, Eko Job Centre, Lucia Cobbina, said the centre is a private public partnership recruitment and employment initiative in conjunction with the Lagos State Government designed to provide full range of assistance to job seekers and employers.
 
She said the mission of the centre is to increase productivity in the State by maintaining an efficient database of the workforce; be a centre of hope amongst job seekers and provide access to information and advisory services.
