 Nigeria’s German coach Gernot Rohr .  / AFP PHOTO / PIUS UTOMI EKPEI  The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) yesterday revealed that it has queried Super Eagles’ Technical Adviser, Gernot Rohr over alleged several breaches of the contract he signed with the body, which forbids him to divulge to the public/media information on some aspects of the contract.
 
NFF’s Technical Director, Bitrus Bewarang said in Abuja yesterday that Rohr’s new-found love for disclosing information beyond technical matters to the media is highly unprofessional and against the spirit and letter of his contractual relationship with the football–ruling body.
 
“In as much as we appreciate the work that Mr. Rohr has been doing with the Super Eagles in the past 40 months, his recent penchant for breaching provisions of the contract he signed with the NFF and the Code of Conduct for coaches is not good for the relationship.  He explained the delay in paying the players’ bonus for the AFCON 2021 qualifiers against Benin Republic and Lesotho, saying, “we are in the process of negotiating with the players on a new template of bonus payments based on performance after qualification for championships. This is still being discussed.
 
“The NFF is very much alive to its responsibilities but will not tolerate disrespect for the body and the country Nigeria by anyone. NFF can never be happy owing coaches in its employ, which is the reason why the present administration took the unprecedented step of putting in place a sponsor specifically to pay coaches’ salaries.”The technical director revealed that the NFF paid all the national team coaches their salaries last week, adding, “We are putting in place mechanism to ensure we don’t owe them going forward.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
