The Acting General Officer Commanding (GOC) 7 Division of the Nigerian Army, Brig.-Gen. Abdul Ibrahim has inaugurated a general court-martial, presided over by Brig-Gen. Wisdom Etuk, to try over 70 soldiers deployed in the ongoing counter-insurgency operations in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states. Inaugurating the panel yesterday at Maimalari Cantonment Officers’ Mess, Maiduguri, Ibrahim charged the members to be fair to all. His words:  “The ability of the military to ensure success in operations is achieved when ethics and traditions aimed at enhancing discipline are encouraged. “Acts of cowardice, desertion, un-soldierly and other forms of indiscipline have no place in any army executing (a) war.” He added: “The powers conferred on me as GOC under Section 131(2) (d) of the Armed Forces Act CAP A20 LFN 2004 are brought to bear in fulfilling this command responsibility.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
