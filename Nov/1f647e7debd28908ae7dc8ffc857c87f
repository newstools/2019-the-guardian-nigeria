The Federal Capital Territory [FCT] Ministerial Task Team on Free Flow of Traffic has joined forces with the Department of Road Traffic Services (DRTS) to enforce the ban on Tricycles popularly called ‘Keke NAPEP’ operating along major highways in the metropolis. Chairman of the task team, Comrade Ikharo Attah who led his team to join the DRTs’ sensitization campaign yesterday in Abuja said that the full enforcement would not only restore sanity to the nation’s capital but would help in the fight against traffic gridlock. The Ministerial Task Team is drawn from the Civil Society, and various law enforcement agencies were inaugurated over two months ago by the FCT Minister; Malam Musa Bello to among other things rid the roads of hawkers and allow free flow of traffic. Attah, who debunked claims that the order was designed to unleash hardship on the operators of the Tricycles and residents, noted that the ban was in line with the transportation master plan of the FCT, which stipulates that the operations of all means of transportation must be regulated and controlled. He explained that the Ministerial order was meant to enhance the safety of the operators, as well as that of the passengers, as they will no longer be allowed to move on highways. He further stated that the Abuja project would not succeed if laws and regulations that govern operations of businesses are not enforced and obeyed. “What the Minister is asking them to do is just to restrict themselves to areas designated for them to operate. They cannot be everywhere across the city, particularly on major highways and in the city centre. The ordered deployment of high capacity buses from the fleets of Abuja Urban Mass Transport will cushion the effects of the ban”.
