•ATCON insists service should be optional The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Pantami, has ordered the deactivation of Automatic Voice Mails (AVM), across all Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) in Nigeria. Pantami claimed that based on recent reports reaching his office, the practice has gained momentum in recent times.
   
The Minister in a statement yesterday said the latest trend of financial exploitation by MNOs in the country is through automatic activation of voicemail service on their platforms. According to him, the voicemail service should be accessed at the discretion of the subscriber and not by default. Pantami said the exercise is worrisome and totally unacceptable, as telecoms subscribers incur financial charges for a service they are compelled to use by default.
  
“Voicemail is not a popular service among mobile phone users in Nigeria, coupled with the language challenge among rural dwellers, who mostly do not understand the language deployed by these networks.‘‘It is apparent, that the recent clampdown on the exploitative activities of some MNOs in the country has beamed the searchlight on the sector properly, and some unpatriotic elements in the system are devising subtle, ingenious methods of defrauding Nigerians,” he stressed.
