Ciara has released a new powerful anthem titled “Melanin”. On it, she teams up with City Girls, La La Anthony, Ester Dean, and surprisingly, 12 years a slave star actress Lupita Nyong’o (under her Troublemaker pseudonym ). Produced and co-written by Dean, the track serves as an anthem of self-love that Ciara has been showcasing since the release of her Beauty Marks album. “It celebrates the beautiful shades of culture that comprise the inner and outer beauty of everyone. Embracing the unique nature of our skin tones threads together the tapestry of humankind,” she said in a statement. Melanin which is four-and-a-half-minutes kicks off with Dean’s catchy chorus followed by a number of verses from Ciara. Anthony, JT, and Troublemaker (Lupita Nyong’o) come in halfway through the song, with Nyong’o referencing Wu-Tang, “C.R.E.A.M,” her Mexico City birthplace and Kenyan heritage, as well as Kenyan long-distance runner Eliud Kipchoge.
