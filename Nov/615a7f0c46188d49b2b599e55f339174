An analysis by the NGO of the top 100 bogus news stories about US politics that went viral on Facebook in the 10 months ending October 31 showed that politically tinged false news got more than 158 million views.

It goes against everything that we stand for as a company. We’re listening and working hard to do better.” Incidents described in the Medium post included being targeted for negative performance reviews or snide comments. “On the inside, we are sad. Angry. Oppressed. Depressed,” the post read. “And treated every day through the micro and macro aggressions as if we do not belong here.” The anonymous post maintained that the atmosphere at Facebook has worsened in the past year when it came to non-white workers being recognized, empowered and treated equitably. “The problem is not just with black employees of different genders,” the post read. “We are remaining anonymous because Facebook creates a hostile culture where anyone that is non-white is made to feel fear for their job and their safety to report any bad behaviours.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
