One of the facilitators, Prof. Anthony Kanu of Tansian University, Umunya in Anambra State, who lamented the negative effects on the Nigerian economy, noted that the skills of remaining nationals are not sufficient to grow industries, academia and other sectors of the economy. Kanu stressed the need for the government to identify the nature, extent, and causes of brain drain and its consequences, adding that the government must trace the outcomes of brain drain in the countries of destination. The university don called on the government to establish an atmosphere conducive to private sector opportunities that would provide alternative employment or part-time employment to pay professionals within the public service. He said: “Review and increase salaries applicable to highly skilled professionals employed within the public sector. Design strategies for the replacement of qualified persons who have left Nigeria, for example, through providing scholarships for training in professions that are highly affected, committing those who receive these scholarships through bonds and the provision of guarantees from top government officials to a period of subsequent employment within the country.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
