The Minister further explained that the certification and repair of faulty equipment locally would not only save foreign exchange, but also generate additional revenue for Nigeria. Also, the Minister of State, Dr. Uchechukwu Ogah, tasked the management to make Nigeria the mining hub of Africa, and assured of the Ministry’s to enable them achieve set mandate.
