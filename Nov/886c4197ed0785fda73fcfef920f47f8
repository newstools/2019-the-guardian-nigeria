Some communities in Bayelsa State were yet to commence voting in the state governorship election as at 1:00 pm on Saturday. Our correspondent observed that while voters arrived at the polling units early to cast their ballots, voting materials were not available yet. At Edepie Community Primary School, materials arrived 15 minutes before 12 noon, our correspondent said. Our correspondent also gathered that the situation was not only perculair to the school but also in other polling units. The Polling Unit 17 Presiding Officer who preferred to be anonymous told The Guardian that materials arrived due to delays caused by transport hitches. Foreign Observers told The Guardian that Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had made transportation arrangements with local transporters but was breached for unknown reasons. This, however, led to delays in delivery of sensitive materials to several Polling Units in the communities.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
