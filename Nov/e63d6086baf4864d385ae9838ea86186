 Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr  Pinnick also added that Rohr’s salaries up to October have been paid by the sponsor, saying that there was no  dispute between the NFF and the Eagles manager. “The NFF would start discussing with Rohr on the renewal of his contract by January.. if he agrees with the clauses, terms and conditions in his contract, the federation will give him a new contract before his current deal expires next year. “We will talk about his refusal to pick home-based players because the domestic players need to play for his national team to gain recognition. That way, he can be seen by good foreign clubs. “This does not mean that we will impose any player on the coach. If the coach finds any player worthy to play for the Super Eagles in the NPFL, he should use the player.“The federation has never imposed any player on Rohr since he took charge of the Super Eagles. I want to also bring to clarification that Rohr’s salary  has been paid till date, the only money that will be paid soon to the team is the AFCON Bronze medal bonus,” he said. On the performance of the Golden Eaglets at the 2019 U-17 World Cup in Brazil, Pinnick said the players gave their best to excel at the championship.“The Eaglets should not be castigated for not excelling in Brazil. It is a developmental championship. Countries like France, Netherlands and other notable football nations are growing in youth football development. “Nigeria have won the championship before. We need to go back and work out modalities to do better next time. When the NFF gets the technical report of the Eaglets, we will figure out what went wrong in Brazil,” he declared.
