Also speaking at the event, Chairman of Blaugrana Sports Group, Leslie Oghomienor, who welcomed the Southampton team, said it was important for groups like Southampton and Barcelona to come into Nigeria to help develop youth football in the country.He said the partnership was imperative as the two clubs would collaborate and learn from each other, adding, “There is quite a lot they can learn from Barca academy because we have been here for three years and we have the experience, which we will be able to share with them.  “We are going to share information and resources definitely, so you will be seeing a lot more of this kind of collaboration in the future. “The opportunity for Nigerian youth footballers is here, so the platform is going to be improved upon to teach them how they are expected to perform as young processionals.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
