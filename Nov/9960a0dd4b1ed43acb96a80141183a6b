Yesterday, the trending hashtag on twitter was KFCProposal. Wondering what that is? Yesterday, a man proposed to his girlfriend as KFC South Africa and what was supposed to be just a proposal turns out to be one of the biggest days in the life of the couple. A man, Hector, went to KFC South Africa to ask his girlfriend to be his fiancee and tweeted the good news on twitter. However, one of his followers thought that was a very demeaning proposal and replied to him saying “SA men are so broke they even propose in KFC….they have absolutely no class, I mean, who proposes at KFC.” However, what was meant as a bitter sneer turned out to be the tweet that will push the couple to the limelight. As much as it was an insult directed at the couple, KFC took it up and decided to react to the insult by requesting that people help them find the couple. Other companies saw this as a chance to jump on this thread and contribute to the couple’s proposal for the sake of love. Huawei Mobile S.A promised them “two devices to capture all of their memorable moments. Please get Hector and Nonhlanhla to DM us”. That is not all, PUMA S.A also joined the thread as they tweeted, “Bhut’ Hector and his lovely bride Nonhlanhla each deserve R10 000 of in-store #PUMA threads. Get us in touch with them” More than 25 Brands supported this proposal, other brands that supported this proposal include Tsogo Sun that promised them hotel, Audi S.A, FNB S.A, rain S.A, Emerald, Coca-Cola, Total, Vodacom, Banks, DSTV, Takealot and many more”. The promises include hotel accommodation, car, money, unlimited data subscription for a year, rings, a year DSTV subscription and many more.  Today, KFC SA showed a video of the couple totally happy and dancing with joys at the good news and offers they got.
