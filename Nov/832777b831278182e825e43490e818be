Lagos State Government on Thursday warned residents against dropping dirt on drainage channels. The state’s ministry of information and strategy in a sensitisation message urged commuters to endeavour to clean gutters regularly and to immediately remove the filth and silt after cleaning. Nigeria’s commercial capital faces various flood problems as some parts of the city is always overrun by water, especially the island area of the state. Lagos is one of the fastest-growing cities in the world and a 2008 report warned that millions of people were at risk of losing their homes because of rising sea levels. “Lagos is a megacity with 15 million people, half of them at two meters (6 ft) above sea level, and that puts them at risk as hardly any other big city in the world,” Stefan Cramer, an adviser to the Nigerian government on climate change, said in a Reuters news report. The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) also recently listed five states in Nigeria that should be on “Red Alert” of imminent flooding. Clement Nze, Director-General Of (NIHSA) listed Edo, Delta, Rivers, Anambra and Bayelsa states. Nze said the cause of the current flood in northern states is due to the opening of the Lagdo Dam managed by the Cameroonian government from October 10 to 31. He also said the flood level as at 2019 on River Benue measured at Makurdi is 11.28m, as against a much lower of 9.01m in 2012.
