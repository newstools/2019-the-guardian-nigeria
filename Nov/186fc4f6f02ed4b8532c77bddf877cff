In a report by TMZ, Champagne Papi named his weed business “More Life Growth Company” off Drizzy’s 2017 mixtape More Life. He first gave a hint about the business on Tuesday when the rapper’s team sent flowers across downtown Toronto to promote a mysterious business venture called “More Life Growth Co.” and was posted on Instagram by the recipients. According to legal documents, Drake wants to lock up the rights to his company’s name and then use it to sell vapes, pipes, rolling papers and hookahs, plus a ton of merch like shirts, boots, coats, dresses, gloves, hats, hoodies, jackets, jeans, sweats, shorts and sneakers; he’s even included lingerie in his trademark application. Asides the Marijuana business, Drake is also going into herbal teas for medicinal, recreational purposes and medicinal herb extracts.
