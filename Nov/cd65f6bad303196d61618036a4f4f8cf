Australia-based Nigeria’s former Commonwealth and Olympics boxer, Nestor Bolum says his opponent for the World Boxing Foundation (WBF) Australia/Asia Crown Lightweight title fight, New Zealand’s Shiva Mishra won’t last the distance in the November 16 bout in Sydney, Australia. The fight is already generating interest among boxing followers in that part of the globe. Speaking with The Guardian yesterday, Bolum, who is making a comeback to the ring after spending two years in retirement, said that he was fully prepared for the fight. In November 2016, Bolum made big headlines in Australia when he defeated his challenger, Apichet Siakane of Thailand, on points. Bolum was one of Nigeria’s strong performers at the Athens 2004 Olympic Games. “I have what it takes to beat him on November 16,” Bolum told The Guardian from his base in Sydney yesterday. “I have been preparing for this fight, and I don’t see Shiva Mishra lasting more than three rounds.” The fight will take place in Sydney, and is being promoted by the Neutral Corner Fight Promotion, property of Mr. Paul Nasiri Nicolas and Afif Mikael of AMS Scaffolding in Sydney, Australia. At Athens 2004 Olympics, Bolum fought in the Bantamweight 54kg class, where Thailand’s Worapoj Petchkoomin edged him out in the quarterfinal. Bolum, a former Nigerian Air Force officer, who hails from Ughelli, Delta State, grabbed a silver medal for Nigeria at the Abuja 2003 All African Games and was a semifinalist at the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne in 2006, where he lost to the eventual winner, Akhil Kumar. He took his professional boxing career to Canada some years ago before relocating to Sydney, Australia. The fight against Apichet Siakane of Thailand in 2016 was the first for Bolum since he quit active boxing in January 2011.
