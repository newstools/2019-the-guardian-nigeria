Photo: TWITTER/MINDGAMEACADEMY  The MPC grand finale, according to the organisers, is the biggest championship for both chess and scrabble players in the country, as the best players in board games from across the federation are expected to compete for honours in the three-day event. Among the players listed to join their Nigerian counterparts in the championship is Aba Hydara, who represented the Gambia at last year’s edition of the championship. Hydara, a medical doctor, according to the organisers (MGI), said the competitive and organisational standard of the previous event gave him the confidence to be part of the 2019 edition. “It’s a great feeling playing among the best players from across the world when you play in Nigeria, which is the hub of scrabble in the world. “The experience you get will make you want to come again for the next one,” he said. The organisers stated that the MPC grand finale is the climax of the season, adding that players qualified for the final after taking part in the Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt qualifiers. The convener of the championship, Lukmon Owolabi revealed that over N3 million would be on offer with top winners in the chess and the scrabble events guaranteed a cash prize of N600, 000 each. At the 2018 edition, Abdurrahman Akintoye won the chess event, while Eta Karo claimed the title in the scrabble event.
