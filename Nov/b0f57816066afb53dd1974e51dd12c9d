Over the years, we have seen amazing onscreen chemistry between Nigerian singers, Flavour and Chidinma. It appears we are still in for more lovely treats for them if their latest music video is anything to go by. The two singers came together for an extended play (EP) titled 40 years (Everlasting) that was released earlier today. The 5-track EP boasts of a track titled 40 Years and in the accompanying music video, they set out tongues wagging once again as to whether they are simply great collaborators or lovers. “40yrs Everlasting” EP had exceptional production preference from Oscar, Masterkraft, Fiokee and Elense Bakassi. Many men would definitely be sporting a six-pack right now if they decide to hit the gym with a female counterpart as we see Flavour doing press ups with Chidinma reclining on his back with a drink in hand. The video gets even cosier as they share an intimate hug filled with smiles and laughter before Chidinma opens the track, singing about loving a man forty years from now. Flavour takes over as he sings about his love being deeper than the ocean for his baby. In coordinated outfits, the two serve more chemistry as they sidle up to each other. Watch the video below:
