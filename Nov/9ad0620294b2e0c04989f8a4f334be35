Telecommunications operators in Nigeria now pay over 40 different taxes and levies to various agencies of governments at federal, state and local government levels.
  
These taxes, according to them, are slowing down their expansion drive across the country, while also limiting digital inclusion and mobile penetration, as the vicious cycle continues.
  
Speaking during the presentation of a report on, Tax and Enabling Business Environment in Telecoms sector, at an event in Lagos, operators said the multiplicity of taxes and levies in the industry has a direct negative impact on the affordability of telecommunications services.  The report called for an urgent re-evaluation of Nigeria’s fiscal priorities fit for population explosion set to occur over the next two decades.
  
“The current fiscal landscape reflects an approach that emphasises short term unsustainable gain at the expense of long term sustainable growth. No nation has ever taxed itself into prosperity. Governments do need money. How often, and from whom they take it, are difficult political issues; but we must ask the questions that lead us on a path to envisioning a better Nigeria for us all.
   
“We must designate telecoms assets as critical national infrastructure, to safeguard the lifeblood of our nation from disruptive actions with rising insecurity and terrorist activity, our intelligence and emergency forces,” the report stated.
