According to Oghogho, the programme tagged: ‘Let’s make Nigeria green again’, will expose participants to modern agricultural techniques and technologies.
 
He said participants would learn about writing business plans and feasibility studies for agricultural investment, adding that each housemate would be assigned 20 unemployed youths as direct trainees.
 
Oghogho said: “At the end of the first year of the FHS, a total of 1,050 Nigerian youths will be involved in agriculture across the country. These additional 1,000 direct trainees will equally be assigned 20 indirect trainees each at the end of their second year (that is year three).
 
“Overall, at the end of year five, a total of 65,250 Nigerians will become entrepreneurs or employees in agriculture while cultivating approximately 50,000 hectares of land across a minimum of 10 states in Nigeria (5,000ha/state).”
 
Another promoter, Gloria Sambo, said the selection process would start from online registration, audition of participants across five cities, and eventual camping of successful participants in the farmhouse.
 
She said the participants would be exposed to the various areas of agriculture including food and cash crops as well as animal husbandry and aquaculture.
 
“Qualified applicants will equally be exposed to the various government incentives and funding programmes for agriculture in Nigeria,” she added. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
