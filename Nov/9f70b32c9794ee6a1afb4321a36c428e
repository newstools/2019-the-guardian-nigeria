The former ‘RHONY’ star recently slashed the listing price from $5 million to $3,995,000, equivalent of 1,448,187,500.00 in Nigerian Naira, and now it’s got a new mystery owner. The 2,392-square-foot SoHo loft looks amazing. It’s on a cobblestone street in the historic cast-iron district, with a wood-burning fireplace and a small balcony, the only one of its kind in the building. The home is decked out with walnut flooring throughout, plus an internal atrium and a sunken living room with 14-foot ceilings and triple-paned arched windows. The master bedroom includes a huge walk-in closet and a marble bathroom with a steam shower and soaking tub. Floor-to-ceiling glass windows encompass the bedrooms, and the second room comes with built-in speakers. There’s also a grand hallway perfect for displaying art, and a powder room. The building includes a common rooftop terrace. Bethenny Frankel is an American reality television personality, entrepreneur, and author.
