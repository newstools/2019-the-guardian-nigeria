A Lagos State Traffic Management Authority, (LASTMA) official, Ola Oyeshina who was attacked at about 5:00 pm on Friday, 29th November during the course of sanitising  Iganmu-Sifax axis of Apapa has died. The Guardian learnt that the officer was hit with a huge stone which got him severely injured and was immediately rushed to Area “B” police station along with two of the people that attacked him. ACP Bayo Sulaimon thereafter ordered the detention of the two attackers that were arrested while a letter of medical referral was issued for the victims attention at the hospital. Due to the trauma experienced, Oyeshina was immediately referred to LUTH from Randle Hospital, Surulere, but died Saturday morning. Speaking on the incident, LASTMA General Manager Olajide Oduyoye condemned the attack on the officers in the course of carrying out the function of traffic management entrusted to them by law. The LASTMA general manager said it is unfortunate that the agency lost the young promising officer. He said the perpetrators of the act that were caught will be prosecuted in the court of law to serve as a deterrent to other members of the public who may harbour committing such crime in future. Oduyoye revealed that “LASTMA was established to manage and control traffic in order to reduce the people’s travel time on our roads, increase economic growth through increased productivity and ensure the populace safety and security, a situation where road users will now turn against any government official in order not to answer the consequences of breaking the law is unacceptable and would not be condoned henceforth”. The LASTMA boss emphasised that with the recent inauguration of a committee on war against traffic and environmental offenders, there is no more hiding place for Lagos residents or visitors that go against the law.
