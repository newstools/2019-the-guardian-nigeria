Nwoko Former House of Representatives member and founder of STARS University, Prince Ned Nwoko, has canvassed peace and security as veritable tools for sustainable development, prosperity and resilience of the society. He spoke at the Delta State Peace and Security Summit, declared open by Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, who was represented by his Special Adviser on Peace and Security Matters, Chief Edwin Uzor. Speaking in his capacity as chairman on the topic, “Sustainable Peace and Security For All Deltans”, Nwoko said: “Every segment of the Nigerian society has a huge role to play in promoting peace and security, as sustainable peace and security are best guarantees against instability.” Represented by his Director of Security, Bolum Michael Okwuchi, the ex-Rep commended the state government, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and the Search for Common Ground “for organising the summit at this critical moment of our nation’s search for sustainable peace and security.” He stated that no state or nation could develop its full potentials socially, politically and economically without adequate security, peace, law and order. The governor enjoined Nigerians, especially Deltans, to uphold moral values like hard work, honesty, integrity, patriotism and good neighbourliness, reminding them that, “peace and security are important not just in Delta and Nigeria, but the world over to engender development.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
