No fewer than eight persons yesterday morning lost their lives while seven sustained various degrees of injury when the brake of a trailer laden with petrol failed and it rammed into vehicles. The mishap, which occurred at Felele community along Lokoja/Abuja highway involved four tricycles, two motorcycles, three cars, and a bus. A witness, who identified himself as Moses Johnson, told The Guardian that the accident occurred around 8.45 am, adding that the trailer was coming from Lagos with petrol when it lost control as a result of brake failure. The tanker was up in flames when our correspondent got to the scene of the accident, while an official of the federal fire service drafted to Lokoja for the governorship election was making frantic efforts to put out the fire that covered one lane of the highway.
