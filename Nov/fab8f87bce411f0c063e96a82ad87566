Lagos based human rights lawyer, Mr. Osita Enwe has written a freedom of information letter to the minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, requesting the details of the contract specifications for the work at Akanu Ibiam International airport, Enugu.Enwe said he would like to have the information requested in a tabular format. According to him, the disclosure should include the names of contractors, contract sum, project, project timelines and project milestones together with all payment plans and amounts of money actually disbursed to contractors as at November 13, 2019; powers to sub-contract any or all aspects of the contract; termination for convenience and breach; damages for delay as well as whether the specifications are designed or performance specifications. “The disclosure would include your publishing the information on your website as well as circulating it in print and electronic form, including your social media handles pursuant to the enabling provisions of the FOI Act 2011,” he stated in an open letter to the minister, dated November 13, 2019. The information, the lawyer said, would enhance and embolden the federal government’s clear commitment to openness and corrupt-free administration of public funds, adding that the disclosure should enable non-governmental organisations and public interest groups to prudently provide additional monitoring on the approved works at the airport. He said: “Note that the disclosure relates to the ministry’s “operations, activities and businesses” as well as “information relating to contracts”, which the FOI Act requires you to maintain proper records and to disclose to any applicant under the FOI Act. “Should you consider that the disclosures are exempted information under the FOI Act, we request that you disclose to us the information on the ground that public interest outweighs any need to deny this disclosure. “Finally, should you consider that another ministry department or agency (MDA) has greater access to or interest in the information we have requested, we enjoin you to act in accordance with the FOI Act by forwarding our application to the said MDA within the time limit imposed on you by the FOI Act and to communicate any such decision to us.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
