To diversify the economy, tourism experts have stressed the need for government, and the organised private sector to invest in the tourism sector so as to reduce dependency on oil. They lamented that despite being blessed with a lot of tourist attractions, the growth of the sector remains slow, and the potentials untapped. The experts at a media parley in Lagos State said access to destinations, stronger transportation links and robust training workshops for creative tourism and tourism entrepreneurs will grow the economy and help the country harness some of its significant tourism potentials. Senior Advisor, Red Clay, Dr. Adun Okupe said according to the World Tourism and Travel Council, the country is currently at two per cent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), but has the potential to grow this to five per cent over the short to medium term. Okupe said that different stakeholders at the Nigeria Travel Week (NTW) 2019, would brainstorm on issues revolving around tourism, and proffer sustainable solutions. She said the theme, “Harnessing the Creative Tourism Potentials of Culture Rich Destination,” would promote increased networking and the partnership between the different stakeholders in the travel industry. Convener, Nigeria Travel Week 2019, Efetobo Awhana harped on the need to create awareness about opportunities and the potential in domestic and inbound tourism in Nigeria, as well as intra-Africa travel. Awhana said it was important to nurture a culture of travelling and holidaying, both domestic and internationally.
