The League Management Company (LMC) is set for a big announcement tomorrow, an official of the body managing the Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) has revealed.The league, which kicked off its 2019/2020 season on Sunday, suffered a huge setback last season with the withdrawal of some of its sponsors, including television rights holder, SuperSport. The lack of sponsors’ funds forced the delay in the beginning of the current season by five months. But an LMC official, who pleaded anonymity, told The Guardian that the company is gradually recovering and would announce a major deal tomorrow.   He said the league body has been working hard to ensure that the NPFL returned to its position as one of the best 10 leagues in Africa, adding that the 2019/2020 season would be different from the last season. “We are recovering after the recent setback and by Wednesday we will make a big announcement,” he said.He added that it was not true that the NPFL had been running without a sponsor, adding that what they don’t have is a title sponsor.“Three seasons ago we announced that we would no longer have a title sponsor. That does not mean that we don’t have sponsors. “We have some sponsors contributing to the development of the league, but not a title sponsor.”He revealed that the LMC would also meet to fix a date for the Week One games involving Enyimba and Enugu Rangers, who were involved in the continent at the weekend. Enyimba beat TS Galaxy 2-1 in South Africa in their second leg of their CAF Confederation Cup final qualifier, while Rangers defeated ASC Kara of Togo 1-0 in Enugu to make the group stage of the competition.While Enyimba qualified on a 4-1 goals aggregate, Rangers reached the group stage with superior away goal as the first leg ended 2-1 in Togo a fortnight ago.Enyimba will be away to Katsina United at the Muhammadu Dikko Stadium, while Rangers will be in Yola to confront Adamawa United this weekend.
