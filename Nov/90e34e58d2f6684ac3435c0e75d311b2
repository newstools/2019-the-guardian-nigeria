Bill Gates officially surpassed Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos as the world’s richest person on Earth with a net worth of $110 billion – according to the latest Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The Microsoft co-founder had briefly topped Bezos as the world’s richest man last month after Amazon’s Q3 results resulted in Jeff Bezos losing nearly $7 billion in stock value. Jeff Bezos had ended Bill Gates’ 24-year run as the richest man in 2018 with a net worth of $160 billion. According to CNN, Bill Gates regained the lead on Friday after Microsoft stock went up nearly 48 percent this year, helping boost the value of his stake in the tech giant. Bill Gates debuted on Forbes’ first-ever billionaire list in 1987 with a net worth of $1.25 billion. Jeff Bezos first joined The Forbes 400 list of richest Americans in 1998, one year after Amazon went public, with a net worth of $1.6 billion, the report added.
