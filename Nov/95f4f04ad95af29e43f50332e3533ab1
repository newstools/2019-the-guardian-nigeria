According to The Mirror, a man who has an uncanny resemblance to Michael Jackson has been urged to get a DNA test done to prove he is not Michael Jackson. The Michael Jackson’s lookalike with the name Sergio Cortes has amassed a huge following online thanks to his MJ videos and performs his songs at gigs around the world.    A post shared by  Sergio Cortés (@sergiocortesparra) on Oct 29, 2019 at 7:07am PDT  He has the same curly black hair and striking features that the late Popstar has. In a video, he says: “Hello to all Michael Jackson fans, come and watch me perform at Hollywood Pattaya on December 23rd. I love you guys and see you there. I am Sergio Cortes, see you soon.” Fans have flooded the clip’s comments with pleas that he prove that he’s not the real Jackson. Even though he has a semblance to Michael Jackson, his voice and accent is totally different from that of the “King of Pop”. Michael Joseph Jackson was an American singer, songwriter, and dancer. Dubbed the “King of Pop”, he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century and one of the greatest entertainers. Jackson’s contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades.
