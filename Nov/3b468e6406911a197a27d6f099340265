Promises to make state nation’s food basket
Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun has vowed to maintain a policy of zero-tolerance for potholes on township roads across the state from the next fiscal year. He said that no stone would be left unturned at ensuring maximum premium on road rehabilitation within the state. Abiodun gave the promise while appraising the 2020 proposed expenditure of the Ministry of Works and Infrastructure in Abeokuta yesterday. He said that his administration would not be defined as an administration that allows potholes to take over its township roads, adding that the issue of bad roads across the state would be phased out as work had begun with the most specific ones. He said: “Our vision of ensuring that we have zero-tolerance for potholes on township roads will be the policy of our administration.” Meanwhile, the governor has said that his administration is planning to make the state the food basket of Nigeria. He said he would stop at nothing to ensure that everyone interested in farming is provided the needed encouragement for the state to become the nation’s food basket. Abiodun stated this while reviewing the plans of the agricultural sector at the treasury board meeting in preparation for the 2020 budget.
