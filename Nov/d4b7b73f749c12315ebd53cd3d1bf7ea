Nigeria’s first Olympic Medalist, Nojeem Maiyegun will be honoured at the 24th edition of the KARIS Award billed to hold on December 15, 2019 at  the main auditorium of the Household of God Church, Ikeja, Lagos.
 
Maiyegun, who won a bronze medal in the Lightweight Division of the boxing event at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and the Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica two years after, will receive recognition for his heroism and contributions to the development of the Nigerian sport, as well as a cash prize of N2 million, according to the organisers.
 
The Committee Member and Assistant Head of Benevolence Department, Household of God Church, Mrs. Adewale said the Karis Award was introduced by the founder of the church, Rev. Chris Okotie in 1996, in line with his philosophy that “greatness does not consist in being great, but in the ability to make others great.”
 
She said the award recognised and gives cash reward to Nigerian citizens who must have distinguished themselves through their contributions to the development of the country in one area or the other, which has not been adequately recognised.
 
Adewale explained that the Karis Award was borne out of patriotism and the need to foster national unity and zeal, without any religious, political, tribal, or social bias, noting that it is a social/charity event to celebrate God’s grace, encourage patriotism, support heroic efforts, the needy and the poor.
 
She noted that the identities of the previous Karis Awardees, shows that Nigerians from different walks of life, different faiths, tribes, political leanings, geo-political zones and social backgrounds are honoured.
