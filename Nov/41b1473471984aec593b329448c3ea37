Black has dominated the months of 2019 so far and there is no doubt we will be seeing more of it in 2020. Black is not a trend and definitely not a ‘colour of the year’ because it is the lack-of-colour of every year.
No matter your style preferences, something we can all agree upon is the unwavering relevance of the colour black. It’s classic, simple, and can be totally versatile. Here are reasons you should wear black more. Classic
Ever since Vogue called a little black Chanel dress “The Ford” of a woman’s wardrobe in 1926, black has been regaled as the definition of classic, the epitome of timeless and the rare aesthetic option immune to the voracious appetite of trend cycles, which have grown increasingly hungry in the digital age.
