Nigerian gospel artist Chookar has previewed her upcoming single ‘Impose Melekos’ The song produced by Kelly Lyon was previewed at the just concluded Christ Embassy LIMA Awards, where she performed the song to a worldwide live and online audience. The gospel artist continues to promote her self-styled fusion genre named ‘Colors’. She said the song was inspired by the Christ Embassy founder pastor Chris Oyakhilome. Chookar said it means to impose the supernatural on situations/circumstances that are contrary to who you are as a new creature in Christ. ‘Impose Melekos’ is “tongues,” Chookar said. “It was composed from a message by Pastor Chris some years back.” “Impose tongues, impose affirmations, impose the fight of faith, impose the supernatural, basically.” ‘Impose Melekos’ is scheduled to be released in two weeks, though it will stream exclusively as a compilation of the Lima 2019 Songs on the LIMA Streaming Platform this weekend. This new release follows Chookar’s October 2019 effort, ‘Loving Me’.
