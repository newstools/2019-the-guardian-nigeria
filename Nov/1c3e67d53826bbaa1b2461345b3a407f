The Oyo State Government has said that 23 of the rescued inmates of the illegal Olore Correctional Centre in Ibadan have been admitted at the Adeoyo State Hospital in Ibadan. The state Commissioner for Women Affairs and Social Inclusion, Alhaja Faosat Sanni, who disclosed this at the weekend, said the step was to ensure that the victims receive better health treatment before being released to their families and that about hundred others had been reunited with their families. The notorious centre was last week discovered and the inmates were rescued by security personnel after which Governor Seyi Makinde visited the place and ordered the demolition of the structure used for the centre. Sanni, who urged parents and guardians to always seek government assistance in correcting societal ills rather than subjecting their children to the care of unregistered correctional centres, said: “After due profiling of the rescued inmates by the relevant state government agencies and security agencies, over hundred rescued inmates were handed over to their relatives and right individuals with an agreement not to take them to such centres again. “Parents and guardians should always consult the ministry for correction and rehabilitation of their wards in a better way rather than subjecting them to torture.” She stressed that government would ensure that adequate food, water and conveniences were provided for the evacuated victims as about 23 of them are still receiving treatment at Adeoyo State Hospital due to their critical conditions.
