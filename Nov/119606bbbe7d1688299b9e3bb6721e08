Nigerian afro-dancehall artiste, Inetimi Timaya Odon, better known as Timaya, has dropped the official visuals for his new single titled “Sili-Kon”. He teams up with producer, Kel-P Vibes, to create a heavy mid-tempo tune on this one, with a catchy hook laced in his local dialect. The song is centered around the praise of the female anatomy with emphasis on their behind which, according to him, he appreciates better when they are in large sizes.   The video begins with Timaya at a confession booth with a priest (unsurprisingly is played by controversial media personality Daddy Freeze) to confess his obsession with the female backside, as he sees them everywhere he goes and can’t help but ruminate over the sight. Sili-kon features an array of beautiful well-endowed ladies who flaunt their big backside raunchily, which might become a topic of discussion on social media when it comes to the objectification of the female body in most Nigerian music videos. The video was directed by Unlimited LA and was shot in Lagos Nigeria. Watch Sili-Kon below:
