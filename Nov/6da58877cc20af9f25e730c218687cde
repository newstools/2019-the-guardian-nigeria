Nigerian-American singer Thutmose and Africa’s coolest kid Rema have joined forces together on a new track titled, ‘Love In The Morning’. The new single comes with an accompanying music video and it is lit. ‘Love In The Morning’ serves as Rema’s first feature outside the Mavin Record label. The Femi Ladi directed music video was shot in London and has an ethereal theme to it as well as flashing scenes of a party/celebration. The song is about a profession of affection for a lover who both singers are ready to shower with their very best at any given time of the day, especially in the morning. Watch the video below:
