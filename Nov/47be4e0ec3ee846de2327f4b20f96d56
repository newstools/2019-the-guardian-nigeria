Singer-songwriter and record producer, Idahams has joined Universal Music Nigeria as part of a joint venture deal with Grafton Entertainment. The singer who put out the 6-track Amayanabo EP earlier this year has now followed a new record, Billion Dollar which serves as his first major release under Universal Music Group Nigeria (UMGNG). The song, a rhythmic earnest prayer for God to bless the works and businesses of every hardworking individual, takes on an inspirational theme; addressing the desire to acquire wealth and transcend penury. Also, as cited by Idahams through a compelling video, the song represents the aspiration of everyday Nigerians. “Just like you, I have a strong desire to attain wealth and become a blessing to my family, my friends and my world. This is what the song is about,” he explained. Speaking on his deal with UMGNG, he said: I have been pushing to achieve mainstream success over the last three years and I have been fortunate with the reception that my music has received thus far. The deal with Universal Music Group Nigeria, allows me to tap into the label’s resources and experience within the industry. The goal is to have my music heard beyond the continent and I believe this deal will help me achieve this. Stream “Billion Dollar” below:
