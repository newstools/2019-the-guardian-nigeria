The Nigerian Environmental Society (NES) has urged the National Assembly to speed up the passage of the Bill for an Act to establish the Institute of Environmental Practitioners of Nigeria intended to regulate and professionalise environmental practices and practitioners in the country. National President of the NES and Vice Chancellor, Igbinedion University, Okada (IUO), Prof. Lawrence Ikechukwu Ezemonye, stated this yesterday at the 29th national conference and yearly general meeting of the Society with theme, “Narratives of the Nigerian Environment Needs – A Holistic Approach”, in Benin City, Edo State. He said the Society had been in the forefront for the establishment of an institute that would be a cesspool of trained and skilled environmental practitioners, experts, scholars and professionals that would be committed to standardising environmental activities and practices in Nigeria. Ezemonye, who added that the institute would also conduct studies, diagnose and recommend solutions to the multiple environmental challenges in the country, said: “The Bill was successfully passed by both chambers during the Eighth Assembly and transmitted for presidential assent. Unfortunately, the bill only lapsed due to time and was never declined.   Presently, this Bill is again receiving attention for the re-passage by the Ninth Assembly and just recently passed through the second reading in the House of Representatives and has been referred to the Committee of Whole. We would continually request for the support of all well-meaning stakeholders to ensure that this very important Bill is passed into law by the Ninth National Assembly.” He said the theme of the conference was intended to x-ray the myriad of environmental challenges the country is grappling with and to proffer practicable solutions for containment, adding: “It is instructive to note that in the last two years, the society has actively been involved in strategic partnership with several organisations and agencies to effectively address the myriad of environmental challenges in Nigeria. Some of these include the partnership with the Regional Environment Office of the United States Embassy towards addressing critical environmental challenges in the country.” Meanwhile, Director-General, National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), Mr. Idris Musa, who said that the Nigerian environment must be protected, cautioned against poor waste management system, which poses environmental challenges in the country.Musa, represented by Mr. Dipo Obanewa, stressed the need for sustainable environmental practices in the country, adding that environmental responsiveness cannot be over-emphasised. Some prominent Nigerians, including the Esama of Benin Kingdom, Chief Gabriel Igbinedion; Founder and Chancellor of Igbinedion University, Okada  (IUO) and Senator Ike Ekweremadu, Chairman, Senate Committee on Environment and Habitat, were conferred with Lifetime Green Label Award and Honourary Fellowship Award of the Nigerian Environmental Society respectively.Other personalities at the conference include Director, International Collaborations, Lancaster University, Prof. Kirk T Semple.
