Nigeria’s First Lady Aisha Buhari is facing criticisms after asking voters in Kogi State to forgive the state governor Yahaya Bello for not paying workers’ salaries for more than 16 months. Mrs Buhari also asked voters to reelect Bello, All Progressive Congress candidate in the governorship election holding in the state on Saturday, despite this. Mrs Buhari subsequently invited the governor to the podium, saying, “I want Yahaya Bello to talk to you about timely payment of salary.” She blamed the non-payment of salaries on delay from a verification process. “But this time, vote for him for continuity of payment of salary on time,” Mrs Buhari said. Her pleas were not only shallow, but they also belittled the sufferings of the people. Usually revered for her willingness to speak truth to the leadership of the All Progressives Congress publicly, Mrs Buhari’s pleas on behalf of Kogi State governor disappointed many.  Deji Adeyanju, a staunch critic of the APC, tweeted “Clowns trying to bury Kogi.” “Aisha Buhari and her children living in affluence and flying about in 1st class flights but begging Kogi state Civil Servants to wallow in abject poverty and die of hunger for Yahaya Bello to stay put in power, he has done nothing with but enriches himself More,” Ella James, Co-Founder Just World For Women and Children Initiatives tweeted. Another twitter user also wrote “Aisha Buhari has joined them in pleading on behalf of the donkey called Bello but what’s more laughable is that some pple still hold this woman in high esteem. I believe it was Einstein who said he was more certain of human stupidity being infinite than he was of the universe.”   To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
