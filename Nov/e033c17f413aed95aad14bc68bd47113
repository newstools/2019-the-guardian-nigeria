A survivor of sickle cell disease and Editor of African Sickle Cell News magazine, Ayoola Olajide, 55, has advised sickle cell patients to always stay hydrated, to prevent them from having vaso-occlusive crises, pain crises, strokes and infections associated with the disease. He said drinking eight to 10 glasses of water daily could help to control some of the pains. Speaking at Easy Competition, organised for Falomo Junior High School, Lagos by PIDGIN OPERA, in conjunction with Richard Coker Foundation, Song Queen and Sickle Cell News Magazine in Lagos, Olajide implored parents to always encourage their children, who have sickle cell, to take enough water, especial early in the morning before breakfast, as this would help them stay healthy. Founder of PIDGIN OPERA, Baba–Jalla Epega, explained that the yearly programme was to promote sickle cell awareness through reading, writing, sharing personal stories and reasoning among junior students in public schools. He said Lagos Island School received financial contributions towards updating its library and computer room. Song Queen’s composer, Helen Epega, said a similar exercise held in June 2019, with three selected junior secondary schools in Lagos mainland– Immaculate Heart Junior Comprehensive High School (Maryland), Opebi Junior Grammar School and Yewa Junior High School Ikorodu, Lagos. She said: “This opera is about celebrating that which brings Nigerians together and sharing African art and culture with ourselves and the world in an inclusive way. “SONG QUEEN is the world’s first ever production of its kind. A blend of the rich African story-telling tradition, using Pidgin English combined with classical English opera. It has been performed in Europe and South Africa to rousing critical appraisal and spellbound audiences.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
