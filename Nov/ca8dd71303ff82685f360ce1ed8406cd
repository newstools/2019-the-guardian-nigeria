Michael Jackson | Photo: NPR The 2 men who sued Michael Jackson’s estate and were the subject of the “Leaving Neverland” documentary are set to get their day in court to press their sexual abuse claims against the singer’s estate, reports TMZ. Wade Robson and James Safechuck sued MJ for sexual abuse, but their lawsuits were dismissed in 2017-partly due to the statute of limitations. Both men appealed their rulings and the cases have been stuck in appellate court until now. The California Court of Appeal just issued a tentative ruling which would overturn the dismissals, on grounds a new California law extended the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse cases. That means Robson and Safechuck can have their cases heard before a jury. However, the ruling is tentative. Oral arguments are set for this week, and the justices could change their minds, but the tentative ruling stands. Wade and James’ story aired on HBO in January, and their molestation claims sparked a movement to mute Michael Jackson and further tarnished his legacy. Jackson’s family called “Leaving Neverland” an unfair “public lynching.” Robson was friends with pop singer Michael Jackson as a child. When Jackson was charged with child sexual abuse, Robson testified under oath at Jackson’s trial, saying that Jackson had never abused him. In 2013, he reversed his position, saying Jackson had abused him.
