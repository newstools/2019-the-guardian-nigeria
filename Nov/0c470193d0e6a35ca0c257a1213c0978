Amid criticisms, the Kaduna Urban and Property Development (KASUPDA) yesterday maintained that the demolished structures in parts of the state were erected in unauthorised areas. The Governor Nasir El-Rufai administration at the weekend began demolition of houses and others in the metropolis, Karji, Babban Saura, Old Kamazo, Janruwa and Unguwar Mai Gero communities. The victims had accused the state government of selectivity in the exercise. But KASUPDA officials clarified that the affected structures were illegal. It was gathered that not fewer than 300 houses had been marked for destruction. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
