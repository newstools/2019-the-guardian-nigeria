The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has concluded plans to establish a large- scale poultry farm at the Federal University of Agriculture Makurdi (FUAM), Benue State to cater for poultry needs in the North Central region. Vice-Chancellor of the university, Prof. Anande Richard Kimbir disclosed this in Makurdi at the weekend during a media briefing to mark his two years in office. Prof. Kimbir also stated that in line with the mandate of the university as a specialised institution with a high premium on research, the institution has developed and produced cowpeas 1 and 2, a feat that has not been achieved by any specialised institution in the country. He said the feat has earned the university many accolades from various individuals, reputable organisations within and outside the country, stressing that it was as a result of such innovations that the CBN developed an interest in establishing a large poultry farm at the institution.
