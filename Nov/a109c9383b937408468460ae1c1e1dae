The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), has rallied industry players to explore benefits of the Africa Continent Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), which Nigeria recently signed.
   
Specifically, NCC posited that Nigeria as the leading telecoms market in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), can offer the continent’s 1.2 billion people telephony services that will boost regional trade.
   
The Commission however, said as much as there are huge benefits, Nigeria must also prepare for the challenges.
With liberalisation of telecommunications as one key area of the continental agreement, NCC said operators in the country will need to invest more in infrastructure to remain competitive in the liberalized African market, which also offers them the opportunity of providing services for 1.2 billion people in the continent.
