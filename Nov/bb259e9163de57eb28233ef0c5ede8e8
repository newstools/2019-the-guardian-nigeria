The National Council on Mining and Mineral Resources Development (NCMMRD), has called on the Federal Government to establish mineral laboratories in the six geo-political zones of the country. It also urged the government to upgrade the existing Nigeria Geological Survey Agency (NGSA) Laboratory, in Kaduna, to international standards and provide reliable geoscience data to attract investment to the sector. In a communiqué, yesterday, the Council argued that the government should fast track the decentralisation of Registration Points in the zones, adding that miners’ risks would be reduced if they applied for Mineral Titles. It equally wants the Ministry to collaborate with relevant organisations to sensitise informal/artisanal miners, to ensure effective formalisation of artisanal mining operations. The Council said: “There should be strict enforcement of the Nigerian Minerals and Mining Act, 2007, through the strengthening of relevant agencies and provide facilities for easy accessibility to mine sites and markets.” Also, both the Federal and states governments are tasked to carry out mining activities within the ambit of the law as stipulated in the Nigerian Constitution, and the Nigeria Minerals and Mining Act, 2007. The communiqué continued: “There should be increased partnership with countries where our minerals are smuggled to, so that illegal activities can be tracked and checked, and block loss of revenue by the government. “We want the government to train personnel to properly estimate the quality and quantity of the minerals being exported, to ensure proper capture of revenue due to Government,” it added.
