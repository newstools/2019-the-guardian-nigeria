Speaking in an interview yesterday, Mba, who acknowledged that his more illustrious opponent might be considered by some fans as the favourite, said he was well primed to create an upset that would catch the current sub-regional champion and boxing enthusiasts off guard. “I respect ‘Babyface’ for being the West African champion, but he will be roundly shocked by the time I am done with him in the ring. He barely survived his last fight and thanks to his last opponent (Eden Biki), I now know his weakest point. So, I will just ramp up my punches hard to make sure he is dazed by the time I knock him out,” he boasted. Mba lauded sponsors of GOtv Boxing Night Mini for introducing the event, describing it as a welcome development for Nigerian boxing and an opportunity for the boxers to improve and pile up their professional record. Other bouts for the event include a national lightweight challenge between Rilwan “Real One” Oladosu, reigning West African Boxing Union (WABU) lightweight champion, and Ola Adebakin; a national cruiserweight challenge between Kabiru “KB Godson” Towolawi and Tunji “Germani” Olajide; and a national light welterweight challenge between Waheed “Showmax” Shogbamu and Semiu “Jagaban” Olopade. There is also an all-female clash as Cynthia “Omo Bobby” Ogunsemilore will take on Omowunmi “Mummy’s Pet” Akinsanya in a national super featherweight challenge.
