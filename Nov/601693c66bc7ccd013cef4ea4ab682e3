Adejumoke Aderounmu is known for her role as Esther in Jenifa’s Diary and Kelechi in Industreet. A rising star known for her interpretation of any script giving to her, The Guardian Life spoke to her on her aspirations, journey from the world beyond and her intentional impacts in the industry. Describe your “Jenifa’s Diary” experience? My Jenifa’s diary experience was ordained. I had auditioned for the role twice. I didn’t impress the director much the first time, but the show creator called me back to try again then decided to cast me regardless. I haven’t been on the show since 2017 November and God made sure I didn’t leave the audience’s heart. He made me the Biblical Queen Esther, even at the end of 2019 I say with all humility, she is still a hit. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1062610 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ADEJUMOKE-ADEROUNMU-1.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="1080" /> Are there any work-rituals you need to perform before being able to blend into any role/character? My work ritual is basically aggressive researching. I take work very seriously, so I get to it by listening diligently to my director during the first conversation I get back home to give thanks to the giver of my talent and the grace to share it with the world. Then we move. A little birdie told us that you almost died last year, care to share that experience with us? I don’t like to be completely open about my private life (and that’s an experience I don’t wish to recall), but I’ll just touch a tiny bit of it to return all the glory to God for a rebirth. This time last year, 30th Nov- 1st Dec, I had suffered an attack in my former house whilst I was indoors and it almost ended my life, but for my siblings and family. I am grateful to God for giving me back my life and full restoration. It is often said “women are their own problem”, do you find this true? And how have the women in the industry helped and shaped your career growth? My honest take on the narrative “Women are their own problems” is that, not all women are the same, there are very kind hearted wise women, who have helped me cross at every point in my life in the industry, from contracting me for work, to giving me international scholarship exposure. I don’t take their support for my growth for granted.  There are different rumours that acting in Nigeria generates low income, how true is this? I’m here thinking an obvious fact cannot be a rumour.  What is your best character and why? Being “Kelechi” On Industreet had me in my feelings, because she taught me I will make a good mum, and she shares a bit of similarities with Adejumoke, so I’m biased towards her. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1062611 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ADEJUMOKE-ADEROUNMU.jpg" alt="" width="785" height="1080" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ADEJUMOKE-ADEROUNMU.jpg 785w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ADEJUMOKE-ADEROUNMU-435x598.jpg 435w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ADEJUMOKE-ADEROUNMU-405x557.jpg 405w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ADEJUMOKE-ADEROUNMU-174x240.jpg 174w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ADEJUMOKE-ADEROUNMU-349x480.jpg 349w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ADEJUMOKE-ADEROUNMU-436x600.jpg 436w" sizes="(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px" /> What kind of stories do you tell with your stories? I try to constantly remind myself of the importance of my stories’ originality and substance. Do you believe films in Nigeria will work if the “art for art’s sake” slogan is applied in the Nigerian scene? I believe every filmmaker have their audience. It’s okay to find what your audience enjoy, if it’s the “art for arts” slogan, be loyal to them. If you weren’t an actor, who would you be? If I wasn’t an actor, I would be in full time singing ministry. I had the privilege to lead my family choir’s first album when I was 9years.
