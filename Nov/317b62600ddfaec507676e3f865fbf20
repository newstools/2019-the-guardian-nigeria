After eight weeks of persistent downturn, the nation’s equities market closed in upbeat last week, causing both the NSE All-Share Index and market capitalisation to appreciate by 0.08 per cent, ending the week at 26,314.49 points and N12.810 trillion respectively. The upturn may, however be attributed to the recent policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) aimed at redirecting funds into the real sector and stimulate economy growth. Analysts argued that the directive have significantly softened fixed income yields and triggered buying interest in some stocks with attractive dividend yields. Last week, all other indices finished higher with the exception of NSE premium, NSE ASeM, NSE Consumer Goods, NSE Oil/Gas and NSE Lotus II Indices, which declined by 0.34 per cent, 0.18 per cent, 5.91 per cent, 0.25 per cent and 2.63 per cent respectively Reacting on market performance last week, analysts at Codros Capital Limited said: “ln our view, the market is a reflection of investors’ views about the expectations for the economy given the still uninspiring macro story. “Nonetheless, we expect the market might benefit over the short-term from recent policy directions as investors seek alpha-yielding opportunities in the face of lower yields in the fixed income market.” Analysts at FSDH Research also said: “The market may remain volatile in the near term. We advise investors to buy quality stocks with a long term investment horizon.” At the end of transactions last week, a total turnover of 2.063 billion shares worth N18.431 billion were recorded in 16,778 deals by investors on the floor of the exchange in contrast to a total of 1.511 billion units valued at N16.193 billion that was exchanged in 15,544 deals during the preceding week.
