The Department of State Security (DSS) has arrested five suspects including a staff of Usman Danfodio University Teaching Hospital, Sokoto, (UDUTH) over an alleged sale of three children abducted from Zuru in Kebbi State. The arrest happened after a complaint by the parents Yusuf Henso and Rabi Kabiru to the vigilante group in the area over the disappearance of one of their twins. The parent said the twins – Hussein and Hussana – disappeared four months ago before being rescued by operatives of the DSS. Kebbi State governor Atiku Bagudu, while handing over the three children to their parents on Sunday in Birnin Kebbi, named the suspects as Comfort Nwanko of UDUTH, Dorothy Okonkwo, Uchenna Benedict, Helen Samuel and one Moses, a resident of Zuru. He said the three children, including a set of twins, were sold in Anambra in connivance with Nwankwo and Moses. Bagudu commended the security operatives for tracking and rescuing the children. He assured the parents that the suspects would be prosecuted. He urged parents to be vigilant and monitor their children to prevent them from falling victims of such occurrences. Bugudu appealed to the media to help expose criminal elements in society, adding that there was a need for the enactment of a law to protect children from abductors.
