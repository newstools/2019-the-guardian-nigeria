President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated Archbishop Ignatius Kaigama on his appointment as Archbishop of the Catholic Archdiocese of Abuja by Pope Francis, following the retirement of John Cardinal Onaiyekan. As the immediate past president of Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria (CBCN), former archbishop of Jos, former president of the Episcopal Conference of West African Catholic Bishops and former chairman of the Plateau State Inter-religious Committee for Peace, the President recognised the roles Kaigama had played in promoting peace, inter-faith dialogue and mutual understanding between Christians and Muslims in the country. A statement signed by the president’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, yesterday read in part. “As His Grace, Archbishop Kaigama begins a new phase of his ministry, the president joined the Catholic faithful across Nigeria in praying for a successful and memorable tenure in office that will see the Church accomplish great things for the unity and prosperity of the nation, while complementing government’s efforts at human and material development.” The president also felicitated with Onaiyekan on his retirement, commending him for his dedicated service to the Catholic Church, and invaluable contributions to the spiritual life of Christians under his pastoral care. Recounting previous audiences with CBCN in the past few years, the president appreciated the many contributions Catholics have made to Nigeria’s development and assured the leadership of the Church of his government’s active support to faith-based organisations as partners in progress. Buhari also congratulated the Serving Overseer of the Latter Rain Assembly (LRA), Tunde Bakare, on his 65th birthday. In a personally signed letter, the President stated: “I rejoice with you as you gracefully clock 65 years of age in good health. I am glad that you have remained faithful and true to your calling, particularly as a pastor and preacher, contributing to pointing people to God’s kingdom, teaching them how to get there, and live acceptable lives before God. “We have shared ideas on how to engender a better country, and formed a tag team for political power. May the ideas germinate fully, proliferate and give us the country of our dreams. “As you turn 65, I pray that your indomitable spirit will continue to point Nigeria to all that is noble and just. I wish you longer life in good health and strength.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
