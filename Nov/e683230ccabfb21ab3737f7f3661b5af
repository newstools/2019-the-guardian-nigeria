As Nigeria millennial takes a larger per cent of the global workforce, they have been urged to explore sustainable ideas and projects to enhance growth.
  
Speaking during the Inspire, Innovate and Influence event, Founder, David Owumi, said the youth of today have realised that Africa is in their hands unlike before.
  
Owumi added that Africa should be proactive by taking drastic decisions in this line or suffer a major setback into neo-colonisation.  “We propose nine subjects only for children in primary and secondary schools. We want to have an impactful time for the new generation, with a high sense of creativity and innovation. We want to channel the children’s strength to solving problems.
  
“The current curriculum does not reflect the future, even 10 years from now. We want the children to be thinkers. We are pushing this narrative and we hope that things changes in no time,” he said.
   
As a matter of urgency, Nimi said the old curriculum is not at par with the global standard. “It is a collective responsibility. Parents should be responsible for what their children are learning,” he added. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
