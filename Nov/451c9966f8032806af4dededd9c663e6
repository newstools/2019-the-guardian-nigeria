Unfortunately, the country is yet to produce to meet local demand for these commodities.” He also cited the effects of post-elections; an exercise he noted gulped several billions of Naira, adding, “As we speak, the same government is just releasing the 2019 capital budgets into the economy.” Onyenkwere’s comment comes against the release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) that measures inflation by the National
Bureau of Statistics (NBS), which rose to 11.61 per cent in October or 0.36 percentage points above the 11.24 per cent recorded in September. In the inflation report released yesterday, the highest in the last 17 months, similar to same level in May 2018. The month-on-month index also increased by 1.07 per cent in October, or 0.03 percentage points higher than the 1.04 per cent recorded in September. The report reads in part, “The consumer price index, which measures inflation, rose by 11.61 per cent year-on-year in October 2019. “This is 0.36 percentage points higher than the rate recorded in September 2019 (11.24 per cent).” The NBS report put urban inflation at 12.20 per cent year-on-year in October from 11.78 per cent recorded a month earlier, while rural inflation rose to 11.07 per cent from 10.77 per cent between September and October.
