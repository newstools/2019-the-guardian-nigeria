So, these are the things we hope to achieve, to help better the lives of the youths.
 
“We have about 16 games and sports holding every Saturday and Sunday from November 2 to 24, 2019.”
  
Also speaking on the festival, the Chairman of the Local Government, Dr. Valentine Oluwaseyi Buraimoh said, “I am happy with this initiative as it has also helped Amuwo Odofin to curb social vices. “This is the second of its kind… we did the first one in October 2017 and it was a success. This is an avenue for us to bring our youths together and to discover talents among the participants.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
