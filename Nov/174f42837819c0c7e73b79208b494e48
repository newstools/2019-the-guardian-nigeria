AS the world grapples with the challenges of global warming, a professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH), Anthony Okonkwo, has called for less consumption of livestock to prevent its negative health consequences. Okonkwo, who spoke on ‘Reducing Business Risk Through Good Environmental Stewardship’ at the 2019 Health Safety and Environment Week organised by the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) for its staff in Benin City, said livestock products have the capacity of producing methane that helps trap down heat within the earth. “The essence of cutting down livestock is based on the premise that livestock in themselves produced methane. “Methane is a greenhouse gas and greenhouse gas traps heat within the earth. You and I will agree that we have noticed that the weather is hotter than normal. And the hotter the weather is, the more rain we have because it follows the natural principle of the water cycle. If there is more sun, water evaporates and if water evaporates, we have more rain. “It is a continuous cycle like that. So if that effect of the greenhouse gases can be reduced by reducing livestock because if there is a demand for livestock, then it means that you have to require more livestock. “So, if there is no much demand for it, it means we have to reduce livestock and if we reduce livestock, by extension, we will reduce methane gas which is one of the greenhouse gases,” he said. He further suggested the intake of soya beans and cowpeas instead of the livestock. Managing Director, Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC), Mansur Sambo, stressed the need for safety measures in workplaces to reduce disasters.
