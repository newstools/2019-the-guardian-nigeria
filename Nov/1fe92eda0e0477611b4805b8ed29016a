 Dr. DanAzumi Ibrahim, Director general of NOTAP  Briefing newsmen yesterday on the achievements of the agency, the DG explained that the agency had embarked on the automation of Technology Transfer Registration (TTR) process in 2017. The process, he stressed, would enable clients to track their applications and quickly respond to any query that might be raised by NOTAP after evaluating the agreements. Ibrahim said 1,190 Technology Transfer Agreements (TTAs) were received while 1,050 (88.24 per cent) were registered, adding that during the period, a number of 283 companies were monitored. He also said since he assumed office in 2015, the revenue generation of the agency increased by over 50 percent from N322 billion to N489 billion in 2018. This development earned the agency ‘The Most Improved MDA in Transparent Service Delivery’ award this year from the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC) chaired by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, he noted. This might have prompted President Muhammadu Buhari to renew the appointment of the DG for another four years, through a letter dated October 18, 2019 and signed by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha. The letter read in part: “I am pleased to inform you that Muhammadu Buhari, the President Federal Republic of Nigeria, has approved the renewal of your appointment as Director-General/Chief Executive Officer, National Office for Technology Acquisition and Promotion (NOTAP) for a second and final term of four years with effect from October 18, 2019.” NOTAP in 2015 initiated some projects in partnership with private sectors to provide scholarships to five talented Nigerians pursuing their doctoral studies in five universities in the country, he added, noting that in 2018 10 candidates were also selected to do their Ph.Ds. On patent assistance to Nigerian researchers, Ibrahim stated that under his tenure, 122 patents were secured from the patent registry in 2018 on behalf of Nigerian researchers. There were six in 2015, 16 in 2016, 50 in 2017 and 58 in 2018. On his plan for the next four years, the GD noted that some of the projects embarked upon during his first tenure would be completed, particularly the completion of its headquarters.
