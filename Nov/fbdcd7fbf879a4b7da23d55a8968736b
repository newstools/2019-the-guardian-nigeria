Nigerian singer-songwriter Timi Dakolo has signed a record deal with an international UK based record label, Virgin EMI Records, a subsidiary of Universal Music Group. Dakolo shared the news of the deal with a picture of himself in a handshake with Virgin EMI Records chairman Ted Cockle: “He said Hello Timi,My name is @ted_cockle and I am the Chairman of Virgin EMI Records @virginemi @universalmusicgroup . I just want to personally welcome you home.” Virgin EMI is a British record label owned by Universal Music Group, the American record label which signed Tiwa Savage in May. Dakolo shot into the limelight in 2007 when he won the West African Idol singing competition. Although he has not been very prolific in the years after that, he has not been idle either. From releasing the Beautiful Noise album in 2011 and having popular songs like Iyawo mi, The Vow to his credit, he went on to becoming a judge on The Voice Nigeria, where he took on the challenge to mentor Idyl – the 2017 winner of the singing competition. Despite not releasing another album since his last in 2011, Dakolo has been able to stay relevant in the Nigerian music space, releasing acclaimed singles each year between 2014 and 2018. A few of the hit singles he has to his credit include “Iyawo Mi” (2014), “Wish Me Well” (2015), “The Vow” (2016), “Medicine” (2017) and “I Never Know Say” (2018).
