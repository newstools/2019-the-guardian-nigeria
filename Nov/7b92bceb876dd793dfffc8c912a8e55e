Joker Becomes First R-rated Film To Gross $1 Billion. Photo. Digital Spy As “Joker” becomes the first R-rated film to gross $1 billion (N361,500,000,000) worldwide, the picture that comes to mind is the scene in which Joaquin Phoenix (Joker) dances as he climbs down the now famous Bronx stairs. The Tod directed film is the fourth Warner Bros.-DC titles to hit the billion mark after “Aquaman” and fellow Batman films “The Dark Knight” and “The Dark Knight Rises.” Despite mixed reviews and security concerns, the Todd Phillips directed “Joker” has accumulated a number of records since its October debut. In its opening weekend, the film made $93.5 million in the US (the highest debut for a film released in October in cinematic history) and $140.5 million internationally. The “Joker” achieved this feat against a modest $62.5 million budget and without a China release. A few weeks ago, Warner Bros confirmed that “Joker” had surpassed “Deadpool” to becomes the highest grossing R-rated film of all time. In “Joker” Joaquin Phoenix features as failed comedian Arthur Fleck who seeks connection as he walks the streets of Gotham City. Arthur wears two masks — the one he paints for his day job as a clown, and the guise he projects in a futile attempt to feel like he’s part of the world around him. Isolated, bullied and disregarded by society, Fleck begins a slow descent into madness as he transforms into the criminal mastermind known as the Joker.
