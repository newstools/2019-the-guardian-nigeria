Security operatives at Malam Aminu Kano International Airport (MAKIA) arrested a suspected trafficker with a 6-month-old baby Sunday morning. A reliable source at the airport told The Guardian that the suspect was tracked while attempting to board an early flight departing for Lagos. The eyewitness, however, revealed that a suspected accomplished suddenly sneaked out of the departure hall as soon as the initial suspect was detained. Although, it was not certain whether or not she was arrested, our correspondent gathered the security operatives had since moved against the escaped suspect. The National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in Person (NAPTIP) confirmed the arrest. When contacted, police spokesman of the Police in Kano, DSP Haruna Abdullah Kiyawa who did not deny the incidence asked for time to find out about the development.
