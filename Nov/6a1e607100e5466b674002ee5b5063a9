 Moyosore Onigbanjo  In a statement, yesterday, he explained that a petition was sent to his office by M.E  Akobundun and Associates of Alpha Chambers, solicitor of one Mrs. Catherine Monisade Dada alleging that the arrested persons encroached and illegally dispossessed Mrs. Dada of a four and half plot of land situated at Farm Tank Depot, Ijegun Egba, Satellite Town, Ojo, which she bought 7 years ago. “On receiving the petition, officials of the State Special Taskforce swung into action. Both parties were invited for a meeting to establish the veracity or otherwise of the petition. It was however discovered from our findings that the suspects conspired and resulted to self-help in illegally recovering the property in question from the complainant and in the process maliciously damaged structures on the property thereby committing an offence contrary to section 2(1) and 3(1) of the Lagos State Properties Protection Law of 2016 and section 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015,” Onigbanjo stated The Lagos State Commissioner for Justice while expressing optimism that justice will be served, warn all land grabbers to desist from their illegal activities stressing that the Lagos State Special Task Force on Land Grabbers have been re-energized to arrest and prosecute anyone who uses force and intimidation to dispossess or prevent any person or entity from acquiring legitimate interest and possession of property acquired. “Members of the public are therefore advised to bring to the notice of the Taskforce on Land Grabbers or any issues bordering on land grabbing by addressing a petition to the office of the attorney general,” he said.
