Super Eagles celebrating their win over the Squirrels of Benin Republic in the first game of AFCON Group L fixture played at the Godswin Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo Akwa, Ibom State, on Wednesday. Will they do the same today? The Super Eagles of Nigeria will be aiming to extend their lead in today’s fixture of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) Group L qualifier clash against the Crocodiles of Lesotho at the Setsoto Stadium in Maseru. Nigeria currently tops the group with three points after coming from a goal down to beat Benin Republic 2-1, with goals from Victor Osimhen and Samuel Kalu played at the Godswin Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State on Wednesday. A win in today’s encounter will give Super Eagles a comfortable lead on the log. After the end of the match day one of the AFCON qualifier in Uyo, Super Eagles captain, Ahmed Musa, had expressed worry over the artificial turf in today’s clash with their host, adding that his teammates are not used to the synthetic pitch. ”As you can see, it was a tough game for the team against Benin Republic but at the end of 90 minutes we have three points. So we are going over to Lesotho to have another win because we know that the game is going to be very tough. ”We are going to play on an artificial pitch, it is not that easy because some of the players are not used to playing on a synthetic pitch,” he said, adding that back home Nigerians expect a lot from the team to qualify for the next AFCON. “But we know what everybody expects from us so we are going there to do our best to win,” he stated. Meanwhile, Coach Thabo Senong’s players have promised hell for the three-time AFCON winners, stating that their visitor must fall in today’s fixture.
