The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), in collaboration with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and with the financial support of the European Union (EU), has released the first report on illicit drug trafficking and abuse in West Africa. The report aims at shaping evidence-based policy decisions and practice, addressing the social, health and economic consequences of substance use by identifying risk factors for drug use and targets for preventive healthcare in the region. The West African Epidemiology Network on Drug Use (WENDU) Report, which covers 2014 to 2017, provides information on the drug situation based on the latest data reported by ECOWAS member states and Mauritania.
