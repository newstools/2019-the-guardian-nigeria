Board disagrees, describes allegations ‘cheap blackmail’ The Computer-Based Test Centres Proprietors’ Association of Nigeria (CPAN) has knocked the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) over the 2019 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) that “was marred by both biometric and browser failures.” CPAN noted that contrary to claims by the board that the examination was a success, the exercise “was marred by both biometric and browser failures from JAMB as most candidates were denied the opportunity to write the examination.” The association said that there were over 2000 candidates who could not write the 2019 UTME due to biometric and browser failures. It noted that the affected, who purchased the forms for the examination, had been denied the opportunity to gain admission this year. CPAN president, Maxwell Akwuruoha, at a press conference yesterday in Abuja said despite the introduction of CBT examination and biometric verification, “ there were JAMB workers deployed on the examination days, who were either incompetent or connived to carry out malpractices.” Specifically, Akwuruoha identified “biometric and browser failure, incompetence of technical staff, inadequacies in CBT centres and excesses in sales of novels, syllabus and brochures” as some of the technical challenges during the test. The CPAN boss added that such technical challenges should not be allowed to happen during the conduct of the 2020 examination.Reacting, JAMB Head of Information, Fabian Benjamin, dismissed the allegations, describing them as a “cheap blackmail.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
