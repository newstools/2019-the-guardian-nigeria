The Appeal Court in Calabar has reserved judgment in the matter by the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate, Mr. Nsima Ekere, against Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The same panel also reserved ruling for Cross River governorship election in which former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Usani Uguru Usani, is challenging INEC that he was the governorship candidate of the APC in the last election.Justice M.A. Mishelia, who led four other judges, adjourned the two governorship cases to a date yet to be fixed. The second three-man appeal panel, led by Justice S. T. Usen, also reserved judgment in the case of Senator Godswill Akpabio of APC against Senator Chris Ekpenyong of PDP for Akwa Ibom North-West Senatorial District and seven others. Meanwhile, judgment is expected today for five National and State Assembly cases of Cross River and this will be delivered by the three-man panel chaired by Justice Tijjani Abubakar.For the Akwa Ibom governorship election matter, counsel to the appellant, J. S. Okwepa, said their appeal was based on seven grounds urging the Appeal Court to “nullify the purported election” because the “trial tribunal” engaged in technical areas rather than engaging in substance and merit of the matter.” But counsel to Emmanuel (first respondent), Mr. Onyekachi Ikpeazu (SAN), assisted by Chief Assam Assam, Solomon Umoh (SAN) and others, urged the Appeal Court “to dismiss this appeal.”Counsel to PDP, Mr. Tayo Oyetibo and that of INEC, Mr. Sylvester Ogwemoh, also urged the Appeal Court to dismiss the appeal.
