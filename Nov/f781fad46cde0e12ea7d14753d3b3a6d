The governor said: “The test of leadership is when a mosquito is blowing your ear, if you keep quiet, nobody will hear and if you shout mosquito, mosquito everybody will hear…may we not be provoked by it.” Oshiomhole had in July likened the political situation in the state to that of a buzzing mosquito around the ear. But Obaseki during the Edo Women Summit held in Benin City to mark his third year in office said: “They say we are mosquito, but we will show them mosquito can cause malaria. If you are not careful, malaria will kill you.” Also, the Commissioner for Social Development and Gender Issues, Mrs. Maria Omozele Edeko, called on women from all of the state’s 18 council areas to back the governor in his second term bid. Her words: “So I call on all women to give the greatest support to the governor in the struggle for a second term. No matter the money that may be given to you by those that want to steal our common patrimony, we must resist this evil and stand by the government of Mr. Godwin Nogheghase Obaseki. “The salvation of women, children, the elderly, persons living with disabilities and the entire people of Edo State lies in the survival of the administration of Obaseki. Take it as a fight for your survival and that of your children. Fight for it because you believe in it. It is an issue of principles and values. “(It) is the people that should determine who they want to go into (a) social contract with. Women should lead the fight for a second term of Obaseki. When there is peace and prosperity, the women are better off. We all as a people must support him to continue his governance without any disturbance.” Appreciating the women for their backing, Mrs. Betsy Obaseki noted that her husband had remained focus on the people, reminding them that they could hardly survive where “unbridled might is power.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
