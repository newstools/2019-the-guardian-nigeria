Makinde, who stated this while launching 100 patrol vehicles meant to tackle insecurity in the state, said the distribution of the security vehicles was aimed at improving the security architecture of the state. The governor, during the hand over of the vehicles to all security agencies, held at the Agodi Secretariat, Ibadan, said: “I can’t wait to see officers chase criminals down the streets with the siren blaring because they now have everything that is required to make them do their job. “I can assure the officers that their welfare will be a top priority for us. So, on this note, we will give the vehicles out and start looking at how the criminal elements will ‘pick race’ from Oyo State.” Besides, the governor also ordered staff audit verification and payroll validation exercise, which kicks off today.
