Speaking on the importance of the LIMA awards, Media Director of the Ministry, Pastor Tony I Keokuk, said: “We believe that if you give people opportunities to express themselves, they will excel. We felt there were limited opportunities available to our artistes to be celebrated outside as gospel music ministers, so, we instituted the awards to recognise and honour our own.” Addressing guests at the event, President Loveworld Incorporated, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome, lauded the artistes for taking gospel to the world with a unique passion and expressing the love of God to people.He commended the singers for their work and labour of love, creativity and using their resources to preach the gospel and reaching the poor and needy in the society.

He said: “All I know is that grace did it for me. All of us work really hard to make sure that the gospel of Jesus Christ is spread around the world. Once you keep improving your skill, following the Holy Spirit, you can never go wrong in the industry.”Speaking on why some gospel artists move to secular  music, Frank said gospel artists that have an understanding of what Christianity is, won’t want to go anywhere.So if someone look away or is drawn by money, that may be up to them, but we know we have found rest here and there is money in Jesus Christ.”He advised gospel artists to keep working on their music, never give up and keep living for Jesus Christ saying that is the only way they can truly have fulfillment.
