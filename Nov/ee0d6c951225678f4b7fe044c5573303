This measure includes the immediate commencement of palliative work along the axis by the Ogun State Public Works Agency (OGPWA) to ease the flow of traffic on the road. The governor took this decision after he observed that the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) frequently had cars parked along the road, especially during their routine stop-and-search operation, saying: “Those vehicles that the FRSC usually have parked by the roadside contribute to gridlock and pose danger to unsuspecting motorists.” He, therefore, issued a “no parking” directive to the corps. Already, officers of the Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE) are in the area controlling traffic and to possibly move roadside traders from the right of way. The governor, who disclosed that the state government was working on providing necessary equipment for the Fire Services, said: “We are going to ensure that our fire-fighters are adequately equipped to promptly respond to emergencies within their jurisdiction.” Abiodun added that the government was engaging federal Ministries Departments and Agencies (MDAs) concerned with road maintenance primarily to avoid duplication of exercise. According to him, “We are engaging the Federal Ministry of Works and the Federal Road Maintenance Agency in such a manner that whenever we have a peculiar reason to work on roads within their coverage, we would alert them while TRACE officers manage traffic during the repair work.” The governor, therefore, advised the public to avoid habits that may contribute to the damage of roads such as the dumping of refuse in drainages. He also urged motorists to adhere to traffic rules and avoid pouring harmful chemicals and products on the asphalt surface of roads.
