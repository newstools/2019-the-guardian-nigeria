Dark Matters Racing Team, a motor sport club based in Lagos have unveiled Produce Extract Limited as their official sponsor in the RoadX motor sports racing series in Nigeria.This sponsorship deal, which would see the team in the final race of the 2019 RoadX series, to be held on November 29,  in Benin City, Edo State, was made known at the unveiling and signing ceremony at the weekend in Ikeja, Lagos.
 
The agreement is the first ever made by a local corporate body for the sponsorship of a motor sport racing team in Nigeria.Speaking to The Guardian, the Dark Matter Racing Team Principal, Arawore Ikutegbe said the deal was of huge benefit, adding that it had been difficult for most teams to race regularly because it costs a lot of money to put the cars together and take them to the tracks, especially with the bad roads.
 
He said the Produce Extract’s support for Dark Matter Racing team would ensure the teams are competitive in their races, adding that the sport would expect more fast racing, action and people on track.  Also the Deputy Team Principal, Dark Matter Racing, Tony Dia emphasised on the role of sponsorship in improving the motor sport racing industry in Nigeria, noting that it was expensive, especially the cost of putting the cars in shape, moving the cars, paying drivers, insurance and health were quite high.
