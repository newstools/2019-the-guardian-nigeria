Seeks new regulations to protect local broadcast industry The Federal Government has directed National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately come up with regulations for the broadcast of content on the internet and the web to ensure that those who provide broadcast services online do so with responsibility. It also instructed the commission to immediately come up with fresh regulations that will promote the local broadcast industry and protect it from monopolistic tendencies and also ensure that all anti-competitive behaviours are deterred and sanctioned where they occur.
 
Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who gave the directives when he received the report of NBC Reform Implementation Committee yesterday in Abuja, said he would immediately commence the process of forwarding an Executive Bill for consideration of the Federal Executive Council and further legislative action, adding that the bill will address the existing lacuna in the areas of regulation of internet, the ongoing Digital Switch Over, Digital Access Fee, and insulation of the regulator from partisan politics.
 
He disclosed that in line with Mr. Presidents directive, the commission would be mandated to amend the code through new regulations to reflect the upward review of fines from N500,000 to N5,000,000 for breaches relating to hate speeches, inciting comments and indecency while willful repeat of infractions on three occasions after levying fine on a station to attract suspension of license.
