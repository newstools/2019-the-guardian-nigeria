Julius Malema Comes Under Fire For Supporting Burna Boy. PHOTO: The South African South African politician and activist Julius Malema has become the subject of backlash following his support of Nigerian Afro-pop artist Burna Boy. A few weeks ago, The Guardian Nigeria reported that the Nigerian Afro-fusion artist was scheduled to perform at “Africa Unite”, an anti-xenophobic concert in South Africa. This news was met with negative reactions from South Africans who took to social media to voice their displeasure at the inclusion of Burna Boy in the concert. A while later, a petition letter written by musicians and organisers under the umbrella of Tshwane Entertainment Collective, to the Department of Sports, Arts and Culture raised objections against the concert and called for the department to pull its sponsorship of the event. The petition letter particularly objected against Burna Boy’s inclusion in the concert. However, in his reaction to the news Malema affirmed his support for the African Giant, also stating that no one can stop him from performing: “Looking forward to receiving and being entertained by my brother @burnaboy here at his home called South Africa. There’s no mascot that can stop him from performing, he’s one of our own and we will protect him. We must resolutely oppose regionalism led by political illiterates.” The vocal activist suffered the backlash from fellow South Africans for his comment. Undaunted, he came back a few hours later to reiterate his undying support for Burna Boy: “I won’t be intimidated or blackmailed by bed wetting boys, welcome home @burnaboy. South Africa is a home for all Africans, kill me for defending an African brother, bloody Cowards.” Below are some of the reactions to Malema’s tweet:     Julius Sello Malema is a South African Pan Africanist politician who serves as Member of Parliament and the leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters, a South African political party, which he founded in July 2013.
