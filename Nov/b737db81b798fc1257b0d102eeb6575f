The Management of Akwa United Football Club of Uyo has asked the team’s supporters for patience and keep faith in the ability of the team to turn things around in the six-week-old Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL). Club chairman, Mr. Paul Bassey yesterday described what was happening to Akwa United as not strange in football and should not attract premature condemnation and hasty conclusions, “tending towards the negative.”
 
He said, “Since the advent of the Governor Udom administration, Akwa United has become the state’s sports flagship, flying high Akwa Ibom’s flag to the delight of all.” He reminded the fans about the history of the club in the past four years, noting that, it has been one of pride and consistent glory, adding that it is not about to change. “The results we have garnered in the last five matches are not in consonance with all the support we have received from Governor Udom Emmanuel and the good people of Akwa Ibom State and we are poised to reward him in tandem with our God given culture of success. “Our Sports Commissioner, with a passion for excellence and belief in Akwa United deserves our compensation. “Not forgetting our loyal fans who have invested their emotions in us. For five weeks, they have been stressed. We promise redemption.” The Akwa United boss reiterated his belief in the Almighty, adding, “We surrendered this team to God and He will not allow us see shame for
His name sake. “We went for some of the best legs in the league, supported by an array of budding youth of Akwa Ibom State origin who daily strive to touch glory. “Our technical crew is one of the best, if not the best.” He was all praise for the current run of success of Dakkada FC. “I thank this government for giving Akwa Ibom State a choice, and for more youths the opportunity to showcase their talents on the national stage.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
