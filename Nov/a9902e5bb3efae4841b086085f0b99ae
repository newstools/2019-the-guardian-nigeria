African music stars, Sarz and Wurld have dropped the video of their collaborative single “Ego (Nobody Wins)”. The track is off  Sarz’shighly anticipated EP, “I love Girls with Trobul”. The video opens with two females advising their friend who appears to be in a troubled relationship as she attempts to defend the flaws of her man. We are then transported to a solemn WurlD who sings about his lover that has grown bigger than him and parades herself to others as a single woman. He appeals to her to slow down because her actions are preventing them from all they could and also leaving him cold. There are flashing scenes of his love interest having fun which is a stark contrast to his sombre mood as she lives it up with her friends. WurlD gets more aggressive as he sings about his resolve not to call her because he knows she wouldn’t also call due to her ego but in the end, nobody wins. Sarz, on the other hand, plays the role of the supportive friend as he offers the distresses WurlD a drink to calm himself but the loverboy is far too gone in his feelings and would rather sing about his lover. There are also scenes of his friends mocking his mood while showing hi photos of his girlfriend having fun. The video ends with the lovers running into each other alongside their friends in an awkward encounter. The video depicts the too familiar in-between stages of a “freshly brewed relationship,” where there’s too much heat to be single but not enough to be a couple. It also takes a “nosedive into the root of dysfunctional relationships in popular culture and tells a story of the battle of the egos that resonates with a lot of young couples today, which we all well know that nobody wins in the end”.
