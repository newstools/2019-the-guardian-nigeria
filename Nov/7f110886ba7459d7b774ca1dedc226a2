Photo: PEXELS  Briefing reporters in Abuja, Grace Jerry of Inclusive Friends Association, and Lois Auta of Ceda Seed Foundation, said they are considering taking the action due to ill-treatment meted to their members by airlines. According to them, PWDs and others have suffered a similar fate, which most often leaves passengers with disabilities stranded, and even frustrated on arrival at their destinations. They also said: “over the years, our people have had to cope with a lot of inconveniences and discomfort as passengers from boarding to disembarking, adding that these have been their experiences. “The Nigerian Disability Act 2019 provides that all means of transportation be made accessible with facilities that will guarantee that all PWDs use it with no difficulty,” Lois Auta added. Also, Florence Marcus of Amputee Coalition of Nigeria maintained: “we are not disabled people, rather, institutions make them physically challenged, urging for implementation of existing laws in the country. “So each time you encounter us, understand that and treat us equally, or provide all necessary accommodations that would enable us to enjoy every privilege and rights we paid for on your airline.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
