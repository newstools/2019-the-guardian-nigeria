UNICEF said it was in the process of delivering more than 110,000 doses of measles vaccine to Samoa’s population of about 200,000. With the virus sweeping through the South Pacific, the agency said it had also sent vaccines to Tonga and Fiji. Officials were also helping with preparations for potential outbreaks in Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, Kiribati, the Cook Islands, the Marshall Islands and Micronesia. It said Samoa, which is by far the worst affected, had low measles vaccination rates of 28-40 percent. In Tonga and Fiji, which have vaccination rates of 99 percent and 81 percent respectively, the outbreak is more contained and there have been no fatalities. Children are the most vulnerable to measles, which typically causes a rash and fever but can also lead to brain damage and death. Samoa has closed all schools and kindergartens, as well as banning children from public gatherings, in a bid to halt the spread of the virus. After initially facing criticism for its slow response, the government had opened a national emergency operations centre to roll out mass vaccinations.
