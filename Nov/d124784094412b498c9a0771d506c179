The Federal High Court sitting in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State has ruled that the All Progressives Congress (APC) has no candidate for the Saturday governorship election in the state. The judge Justice Jane Inyang ruled that David Lyon was not the party’s candidate for the election. One of APC’s governorship aspirants in Bayelsa Heineken Lokpobiri filed the petition against the Lyon. Lokpobiri, a former minister of state for agriculture asked the court to declare him the authentic candidate of the APC. “The court pronounced that the governorship primary conducted by the APC in Bayelsa state was not done in compliance with the guidelines and the constitution of the party, and, therefore, the party has no candidate,” Lokpobiri’s lawyer, Fitzgerald Olorogun, told journalists after the court ruling. “We’ll do the needful. But for now, the pronouncement of the court is that APC has no candidate.” A Federal High Court in Abuja on Tuesday disqualified Lyon’s running mate Biobarakuma Degi from participating in the election because he provided conflicting information on the documents he presented to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The case against Mr Degi-Eremienyo was filed by the PDP.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
