A Guardian reporter Oludare Richards was assaulted by operatives of the State Security Service while covering the “Free Sowore” protest in Abuja on Tuesday. Richards was violently shoved and abused by the DSS operatives leaving him with a nasty head wound and several bruises on his arm. He was swooped upon during a protest at the headquarters of the service over the continued detention of the convener of the #RevolutionNow protest, Omoyele Sowore. The protesters thronged the DSS office on Tuesday morning, however; they were met with resistance by the officials who shot in the air to disperse the crowd. Rights activist and leader of the protest, Deji Adeyanju had said earlier that he was offered the sum of N1 million at gunpoint to suspend the protest. Adeyanju didn’t reveal the identity of the persons that offered him the cash. He, however, displayed the cash. Details later.
