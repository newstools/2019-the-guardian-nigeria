Nigeria’s House of Representatives Tuesday adopted a motion seeking the immortalisation of late Dr Amayo Adadevoh, a medical doctor who led the country’s successful fight against Ebola in 2014. The lawmaker also held a minute silence in her honour and asked that a prominent public health center in Lagos, where she died, be named after her. Adadevoh, a consultant physician and endocrinologist, died after contracting the deadly Ebola virus while treating a Liberian-American, Patrick Sawyer, and other victims of the disease in Nigeria. The medical practitioner was threatened by Liberian officials who insisted she must release Sawyer who took a flight from Monrovia to attend a conference in Calabar. She insisted that the patient must be isolated as she examined him and found he had contacted the deadly disease. Adedovah’herioc efforts prevented a major outbreak in a  country with over 190million population. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
