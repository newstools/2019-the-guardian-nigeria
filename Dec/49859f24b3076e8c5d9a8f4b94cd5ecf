A Russian-trained Political Scientist and philanthropist, Dr. Obiora Okonkwo has enjoined all those aspiring for the 2021 governorship poll in Anambra State to start showing up, so as to enable the electorate to assess them to make informed choices during the election. Dr. Okonkwo, who spoke at a town hall meeting with Anambra indigenes from North America, said the problem the state keeps encountering in the course of leadership selection is “waiting to see people emerge on various political platforms, before considering how to vote.” While contending that the nation’s electoral system tends to exclude the electorate and encourage lack of internal democracy in political parties, Okonkwo, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), said the people should be involved in the debates about the needs and challenges of Anambra State. He said: “We, as citizens, know the problems of the state. The level of indebtedness, for instance, is so high that all should be concerned. We must be worried about these problems and be involved in the search for a solution, especially in the leadership selection process. If a country like Rwanda, coming out from genocide and without quality, people could get it right and turn things around with a good leader, we can.” The High Chief disclosed that in the coming year, he intends to initiate a statewide conversation among Anambra indigenes on the qualities needed in the next governor, as well as priority areas of government attention, stressing that it is such bottom up approach in policy formulation and implementation that guarantees the beauty of democracy. Okonkwo, who is also Dikeora Ogidi, maintained that greater public participation in the emergence of candidates for elective offices would help to check excesses of overzealous party chiefs and reduce the tendency for imposition, electoral violence and rigging.
