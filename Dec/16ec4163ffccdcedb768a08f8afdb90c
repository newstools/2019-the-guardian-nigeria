Bournemouth meanwhile remain precariously placed just two points above the bottom three and could even end the day in the relegation zone if West Ham and Aston Villa win later on Saturday. Jahanbakhsh has struggled to make an impact on the south coast since a big money move from AZ Alkmaar at the beginning of last season. However the Iranian was moved to tears when he opened the scoring with his first Premier League goal less than three minutes into his first league start of the season. Only a marginal offside call after a VAR review denied Dan Burn a second for Brighton early in the second half. However, Mooy produced a moment of magic to secure the points 11 minutes from time as he controlled the ball on his chest, turned inside his marker and curled the ball into the far corner.
