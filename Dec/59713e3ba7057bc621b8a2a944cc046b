The Chairman, Board of Commissioners, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Olabiyi Durojaiye, has expressed the determination to ensure increased contribution of the telecommunications sector to the growth of the nation’s economy come 2020. Speaking Sunday, in Abuja, Durojaiye noted that the sector has contributed over 10 percent to the nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2019, adding that it played a critical role in the administration’s economic recovery and growth plan, and is emerging as the key driver of the economy.
Durojaiye noted that part of the plans by NCC in the coming year is to drive the cyber optic cables all over the 774 Local Government Areas in Nigeria, to increase Internet penetration and enhance quality of service. He said, “We need to plan ahead and key into the digital economy. The whole world is going through the 4th industrial revolution and digitisation, and we must be in the forefront. We need to identify brilliant Nigerians and train them to invent something new that we can be proud of.”He noted that Nigeria is the first country in Africa to join the league of 5G nations following the launch of 5G trials by MTN, and urged the staff of NCC to key into the vision of the Commission.
