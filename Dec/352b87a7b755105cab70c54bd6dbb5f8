Some Nigerians living in Spain on Friday attacked Nigeria’s transportation minister Rotimi Amaechi while on a national assignment. “Some minutes ago, I was attacked by a few misguided Nigerians while on national assignment at a climate change event in Madrid, Spain,” Amaechi tweeted on Friday. “They were quickly repelled by the Spanish police before they could do any harm.” The Nigerian minister said he escaped the scene of the attack and left unhurt. The attack on Amaechi is the second assault against a Nigerian official abroad. On Saturday, August 17, former Nigeria deputy Senate president Ike Ekweremadu was attacked by members of secessionist movement Indigenous People of Biafra, (IPOB) in Nuremberg, Germany. The Senator said he was disappointed by the conduct of the IPOB members and had reported the attack to the Nigerian Ambassador to Germany, Yusuf Tuggar. “I tried to engage them, but when they became unruly, I had to leave the venue. The organisers also invited the police and I was accompanied by the venue,” Ekweremadu said. In the 64-second video that showed the attack, Ekweremadu was seen being violently questioned over his alleged conspiracy with the Federal Government to proscribe the IPOB in the South East and the alleged killing of its member.
