Mathew Knowles Clears Air On Beyonce and Kelly Rowland Harassment Claims. Image: PageSix Beyonce’s father Mathew Knowles has clarified the reports that his daughter and fellow Destiny’s Child singer Kelly Rowland were harassed by members of the R&B group Jagged Edge when they were minors. Knowles took to his Instagram page to share a video in which he set the record straight that he did not state that Beyonce and Rowland were sexually harassed: “I feel the need to clarify that I did not say the girls were sexually harassed while on tour with Jagged Edge in the 2000s. I said ‘harassed. The term ‘sexual harassment’ may imply to some to mean physical advances. I would classify the harassment they encountered more as unwelcome and inappropriate remarks to minors from adults who should have known better.” It was reported last week that Knowles revealed in an interview with Vlad TV that Beyoncé and Kelly Rowland reported to him that they were “constantly being harassed” on tour by two members of the male vocal quartet, Jagged Edge. In the interview Knowles said: “They’re 16-years-old… the guys are 21 and 22-years-old. I have a fiduciary duty with minors, by the law, there’s a certain way I have to manage that. “I got a call from Kelly and Beyoncé… saying that they were constantly being harassed by two of the members of Jagged Edge,’ I couldn’t have that. I literally had to put the guys off the bus in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. That began all of this drama.” Jagged Edge denied the allegations by sharing a meme on Instagram that read: “A lie don’t care who tell it.”
