The Executive Director of African Centre for Peace and Development, Comrade Shehu Sani, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to address the allegation raised by southerners that his government is dominated by northerners and Muslims.He gave the charge yesterday while receiving members of Bushara Baptist Church led by Rev. Joel Yohana in Kaduna where they presented him with the book,  “77 Years Silent Exploit in Northern Nigeria: The untold story of Bushara Baptist Church from 1948-2019.” The representative of Kaduna Central in the eighth Senate also asked the president to address the claims by northerners that his government was only executing projects in the south.He therefore called on northern leaders to urgently “convene a conference to unite people of all religions and also to talk truth to themselves on the need to go back to Sir Ahmadu Bello, the Sardauna of Sokoto’s philosophy of peace and unity.” Sani, who expressed concern at the divisive character of the body polity, stated: “It is over 100 years of amalgamation in Nigeria and we are still talking about north and south, Muslims and Christians. If there is good governance, nobody will care about wherever you are from. “But in our society and nation today, because of the sensitivity of religion in our lives and in our history, it is important all religions must have equitable representation in the affairs of governance if we are to be peaceful. “It is also unfortunate that the solid foundation for unity and peace laid by the late Sardauna of Sokoto and the founding fathers of Nigeria was not followed by subsequent leaders who themselves as representatives of their ethnic groups.” He went on: “The Baptist Church in Hadeja Road in Kaduna is an example of unity, peace.  It is a church that is right in the middle of a Muslim community and they are living in peace with everybody.  That is worthy of commendation.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
