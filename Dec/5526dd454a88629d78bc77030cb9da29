Davido and Cardi B together If you thought Davido has blown your mind with some of his previous music releases, prepared to be blown to smithereens because the singer has a cool surprise. Right on the heels of his recently released album ‘A Good Time’, which is still enjoying critical reviews from music lovers, a leaked video on Twitter has shown that Davido has a remix of his smash hit ‘Fall’ and he has the help of Grammy award winning rapper Cardi B. Cardi B blends perfectly with the song as she raps about private jets, dollar signs, Chanel, LV, Fendi and other luxurious things which she says should fall on her. She also says ‘OBO what do you think’ referring to Davido’s nickname ‘Omo Baba Olowo’. The authenticity of the song has since been confirmed by Ovie O, the co-foudner of popular music website, NotJustOk who revealed that the song was completed some few months ago but hasn’t been cleared for release. Cardi B seemingly confirmed the song as well as she is seen twerking and dancing to it in a video she posted on her Instagram page to announce that she is on her way to Africa. The mother of one is scheduled to perform in Nigeria  for the first time on December 7.   1:03am drop my KK in NY on my way to Afrriiiiicaaaaaaaaaa baybeeeee!!!!!!
