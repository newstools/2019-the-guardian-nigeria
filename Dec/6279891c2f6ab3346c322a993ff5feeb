The United States of America Consulate in Lagos and a non-profit organisation, HACEY Health Initiative, are advocated giving girls a safe space to discuss issues affecting them. This and many other issues were raised at the screening of the sexual violence episode of the girls’ talkshow, as part of the 16 days of activism against gender-based violence (GBV). Deputy Public Affairs Secretary of the Consulate, Jennifer Foltz, noted yesterday in Lagos that the consulate was pleased to be part of the programme, as it fitted into its goal of ending GBV, including prostitution, transferred aggression and drug abuse among girls. She said: “It is a very important 16 days for us and it forms a part of our engagement with some of our alumni.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
