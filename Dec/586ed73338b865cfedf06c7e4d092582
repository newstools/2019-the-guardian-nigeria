Kelly, Lifetime has released the trailer for the sequel titled “Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning”. “Whoever’s acting like they didn’t know is lying,” said Damon Dash, an entrepreneur and record executive. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the new series will feature interviews from a variety of perspectives — including new survivors, supporters, music industry insiders (Dash, Mathew Knowles, Jimmy Maynes), activists (#MeToo Founder Tarana Burke) and many others, such as W. Kamau Bell, Sheryl Lee Ralph Angela Yee, Gloria Allred and State’s Attorney for Cook Country Kimberly M. Foxx. The new six-hour docuseries will air over three consecutive nights starting on January 3 and ending on January 5.  The first series “Surviving R. Kelly” was received with critical acclaim. Seen by nearly 27 million viewers to date, it was nominated for a Primetime Emmy, won a Critics’ Choice Award and its revelations sparked a national debate about the music industry’s longstanding silence over R. Kelly — despite previous charges against him of child pornography. The hashtag #MuteRKelly saw the musician quickly dropped from his label, past collaborators disavow him and, seven weeks later, 10 felony counts of aggravated sexual assault involving alleged four victims led to his arrest. Last week, he was charged with bribery for procuring a fake ID for an unnamed female in 1994 — a day before his marriage to the late R&B singer Aaliyah, then only 15.
