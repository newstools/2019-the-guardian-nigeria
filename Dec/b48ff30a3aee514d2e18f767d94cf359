It’s the season of giving and putting smiles on people’s face and in a bid to stick to this rule, a woman has written and hand-delivered 1,900 Christmas cards to strangers in an effort to combat loneliness. Identified as Mo Fayose from Nottingham. the 45-year-old spent months staying up late into the night writing the cards and then trekking the streets to deliver them. Every card was delivered with chocolates and an invitation to dinner on Christmas Day, hosted by a team of volunteers, BBC reports. Each handwritten card included chocolate and an invitation to a Christmas dinner hosted by volunteers | Photo BBC “There’s an atmosphere about Christmas that makes it very, very depressing for many, many people – being given something, being remembered, makes a lot of difference,” she said. “I had reached number 35 on a street… but it had another 30 houses.

Fayose bought the cards in bulk after Christmas last year to keep down costs but said she lost count of how much she spent, with the total somewhere “in the hundreds”. “Someone came out and said thank you, and I could see on their face it meant something to them,” she said. “It’s all about love. If you can give that back, that little gesture means everything.” The mum-of-two, who runs the Community Cares Club, came up with the idea while working as a mental health nurse when a woman told her how isolated she had become.
