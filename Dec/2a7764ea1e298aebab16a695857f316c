The crocodile was found ‘loitering’ outside the new police station on Temple Terrace, where it was captured and taken into police custody. However, the crocodile did not spend days in “jail” as it was released and freed with the help of a wildlife ranger. Sharing photos of officers with the captured croc on facebook, the caption says: ‘Croc-catching cops not expecting any jaw-dropping alliga-tions after a crocodile was found loitering outside Palmerston Police Station.’ Northern Territory Police said the incident was a reminder to the public to be aware of increased crocodile activity in the Top End during the wet season, especially near waterways. Freshwater crocodiles are native to northern Australia, mostly in Western Australia and Northern Territory where they are a protected species. They live in rivers, lagoons and billabongs but are being wiped out by their saltwater relatives. Freshwater crocodiles are not known as man-eaters and don’t regard humans as potential prey. But they will bite in self-defense and a number of non-fatal attacks have occurred as a result of mistaken identity.
