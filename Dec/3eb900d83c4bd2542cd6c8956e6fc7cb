Super Eagles’ Former Captain, Henry Nwosu has commended the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) President, Amaju Pinnick for his recent declaration that Gernot Rohr must live in Nigeria if he desired to remain the coach of the national team. Nwosu advised the federation to do away with the German if he refused to accept the condition, warning the federation to avoid allowing sentiments to rule on the issue. Nwosu noted that Rohr’s continuous absence from the country had affected the home-based players’ desire to play for the senior national team. The former Golden Eaglets’ coach wondered why Rohr should not be keen in living in Nigeria even when the federation promised to provide all he needs to be comfortable in the country. “I don’t think the NFF is trying to send Rohr away by telling the coach he must remain in the country. This is the standard practice in the world. “A coach that is handling a national team must be in the country to monitor activities of players and also help develop football in the country. “This is the best pronouncement I have seen the NFF make this year. Rohr needs to watch our league, talk to local coaches and mingle with domestic players from different clubs in the country. “I believe NFF was in a haste to get a coach and also naive that was why they did not make this statement in his first contract,” he added. Nwosu added that since Rohr has been outside the country scouting for Nigerian players based in Europe, there has not been any positive result, saying the Super Eagles have not excelled in any major championship in the last four years. “If Rohr says he cannot stay in Nigeria, the NFF should allow him to go. We can’t remain at the same level every year. “The Eagles must progress. I don’t hate Rohr, but the fact is that the standard practice of coaches living in the country they handle their team must be replicated in Nigeria,” he said.
