 Yusuph Magaji Bichi  Flight From Decency
IT is on record that right from its days as NSO, the DSS was created to be faceless, ubiquitous and painstaking in the performance of its core responsibilities, just as its operatives comprise anonymous sleuths.
  
But, analysts maintain that DSS’s descent from glory began when the agency started mingling with politically exposed persons as well as the manner in which its operatives were hired and fired. Security operatives in the department had been accused of leaking security reports and threat assessment to influential politicians as well as tampering with background security reports of aspirants to high political offices.
 
Yet, the DSS remains notorious for its inclination towards assault on media practitioners. Instances abound of how the security agents pounce on, intimidate and detain editors and reporters at the slightest sign of critical reportage of government activities or its officials. Nonetheless, the department has also recorded some remarkable breakthroughs in its operations, particularly the interception of massive cache of arms and ammunition in October 2010 at the Apapa Port, Lagos, which was said to come from Iran.Another breakthrough was in 2013 when the department was said to have successfully isolated and dismantled a terrorist cell being nurtured by Iranians to gather intelligence about US and Israeli targets in Nigeria for attacks.
Bichi’s Burdens DSS’s relapse to the years of the dreaded NSO, which was exemplified by the court invasion on December 7, 2019, comes as a reminder of the toxic leadership selection process that seem to politicize operations of the department.It is possible that the idea of going outside the corps of serving officers to select DSS DGs has brought about some emotional poison within the security circles. Having been retired from the establishment, most officers believe that subsequent DGs, particularly Lawal Musa Daura and Bichi, had lost touch with the exigencies of modern spy agencies.
