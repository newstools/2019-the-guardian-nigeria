Enyimba of Aba reignited their campaign for the semifinal spot of the on-going CAF Confederation Cup when they defeated Cote d’Ivoire’s FC San Pedro 1-0 in Aba. It was their second game of the competition, and the Peoples Elephant had sunstitute Martins Usuile to thank for their success. Enyimba lost their opening game 0-2 to Hassania Agadir and needed a win to return to contention in the four-team Group D.With the game still goalless after the first half, Coach Usman Abd’Allah brought in Usule in place of Samson Obi and the change looked inspired when the new striker made hay to the relief of the Aba fans. In Egypt, Nigeria’s other team in the Confederation Cup, Enugu Rangers were beaten 4-2 by Masry, although the Nigerians blotted the scoreline by scoring two late goals.  Masry were leading 4-0 until the 86th minute when substitute midfielder Eziekwe Chinonso scored the visitors’ first goal before Chidera Ezeh added the second in injury time. The Port Said based-club needed five minutes to open the scoring, with in-form Nigerian striker Austin Amutu blasting a pull-back into the roof of the net. Ahmed Yasser doubled the lead in the 27th minute when his cross-cum-shot nestled into the far corner.Libyan winger Moftah Taktak made it 3-0 to cap his fine display and Hassan Ali completed the rout four minutes from time. Masry, who defeated Nouadhibou of Mauritania 3-2 last week, are leading the group with maximum six points.
