 Public Relations Officer, NCS, Joseph Attah  Public Relations Officer, NCS, Joseph Attah, said the Service would properly inform the public when it is ready, saying: “NCS has again been drawn to the unrepentant activities of internet fraudsters despite several scam alerts by the Service. “Recent activities of these elements show criminal ingenuity, presenting fake platforms that appear seemingly genuine to deceive and extort unsuspecting applicants that the Service has released short-listed names for recruitment examination/interview. “For the umpteenth time, NCS wishes to state that these recruitment Websites/Platforms are fake and should not be patronised. “Members of the public will recall that we denied several similar fake vacancies advertisement with a promise to properly inform the public whenever we are ready. A promise we kept by advertising the vacancies in seven national newspapers. “NCS is again warning against patronage of any release of short-listed candidates with a promise of letting successfully short-listed candidates know through their e-mail addresses and telephone numbers soon. “Additionally, such official release will be news item in all NCS programmes on TV and Radio stations. “Accordingly, all applicants are advised to disregard any invitation for Recruitment Examination/Interview and wait patiently for the official release and invitation from the Service, please,” he stated.
