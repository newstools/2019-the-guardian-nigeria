It was feared he had torn the cruciate ligament, but tests showed the injury is not as serious although Bayern has given no indication how long he will be sidelined for. “The knee will be immobilised for a while by a splint,” said a statement on the club’s website. The 23-year-old France international has had a miserable run of injuries. He tore ankle ligaments two separate times last year which forced him to miss the 2018 World Cup finals. Bayern became the first German club to win all six of their Champions League group matches following their victory over Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham.
