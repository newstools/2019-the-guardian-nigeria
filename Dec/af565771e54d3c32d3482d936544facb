Former Super Eagles number one goalkeeper, Carl Ikeme, has expressed interest to be part of the English Premier League side, Wolverhampton Wanderers, either as a coach or in mentoring capacity. Ikeme was Wolves’ number goalkeeper while in the English Championship and made 191 appearances for the club before he suffered leukaemia. The disease eventually ruled him out of active football for early retirement. But his boyhood club later gained promotion back to the Premier League two seasons ago. However, after complete healing, as he was told he is in ‘complete remission’ from leukaemia, Ikeme has stated his wish to return to his childhood club soon. “With football, last year, it was not something I envisioned going back into. Now this year, slowly, the taste is coming back. “It’s not fully there yet, I’m not too sure, but maybe, eventually, I’d like to be involved at some level. I don’t know if it would be full-on or full-time, but I’d like to do something around the club. “The club have always been brilliant with me and said the door is open when I’m ready to come back. Everything is settled in my life at the minute, and I’m not quite ready to make a decision,” he told Express and Star, adding that he would want to be back once he decides in the nearest possible time. “When I decide I want to do it, I want to be able to do it to my fullest. May be in the near future, may be into the next year, possibly. I would like to be involved with the club. I think I could help in any sort of way.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
