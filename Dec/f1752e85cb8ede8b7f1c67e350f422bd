The Aquaman star came down hard on Pratt for his single-use plastic bottle on Instagram. In the comment, he said: “Bro I love you but wtf on the water bottle. No single-use plastic. Come on.” With no argument, Pratt agreed he was wrong, saying: “Aquaman! You’re completely right. Dammit.” Offering up this explanation for posing with the bottle, he continued: “If I remember correctly somebody threw that plastic bottle to me in the photoshoot cause I didn’t know what to do with my hands! I never know what to do with my hands! So uncomfortable. For real tho. Love you too buddy. My bad. I don’t want your home of Atlantis covered in plastic. Hear that kids? Reduce. Reuse. Recycle.” This comment led to argument among their fans, while some think Jason shouldn’t have pointed that out, others thought it was okay that he did that. This led to Aquaman apologising about his comment in another Instagram post. He posted: “I’m sorry this was received so badly today I didn’t mean for that to happen. I’m just very passionate about this single-use plastic epidemic. The plastic water bottles have to stop I hope u make a reusable water bottle for amazon so we all can purchase.” Momoa has always been an activist for a better climate. In April, he shaved off his iconic beard in a video promoting a new range of recyclable canned water, which he worked on with the Ball Corporation. Momoa is an American actor. He played Aquaman in the DC Extended Universe, beginning with the 2016 superhero film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and in the 2017 ensemble Justice League and his 2018 solo film Aquaman. In Baywatch Hawaii, he portrayed Lifeguard Jason Ioane. On television, he played Ronon Dex on the military science fiction television series Stargate Atlantis, Khal Drogo in the HBO fantasy television series Game of Thrones, and Declan Harp in the CBC series Frontier.
