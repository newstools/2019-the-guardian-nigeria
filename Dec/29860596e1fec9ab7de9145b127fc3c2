The equities market continued its lackluster performance at the close of transactions last week over sustained risk-off sentiments and the absence of market catalysts. With losses recorded in two of the three trading sessions in the shortened week due to festive season, the All-Share Index and market capitalisation declined by 0.41 percent  to close the week at 26,416.48 points and N12.753 trillion respectively. The drop in indices, may, however, be attributed partly to the two days public holiday declared during the week to mark the Christmas celebrations. All other indices finished higher with the exception of NSE Premium, NSE Banking, NSE-AFR Div Yield, and NSE Industrial Goods indices, which depreciated by 2.10 percent, 0.26 percent, 0.42 percent, and 0.31 percent respectively, while the NSE ASeM Index closed flat.
