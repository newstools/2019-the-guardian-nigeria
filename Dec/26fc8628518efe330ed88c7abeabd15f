Just in time for Christmas, American singer Mariah Carey has debuted a new music video for her holiday classic “All I Want for Christmas Is You.” The new video for the 25-year-old holiday classic premiered on a YouTube live stream hosted by Carey on Thursday night, with a live fan Q&A leading up to the video’s midnight premiere. The new Joseph Kahn-directed clip captures the childhood wonder and magic surrounding the season. It opens with Carey as part of a store window scene before a door opens to a winter wonderland complete with skating Santas, dancing toy soldiers and giant candy canes. “We wanted to make a modern classic,” Carey said during the Q&A. “It’s kind of the opposite of the original video… This is more of a production.” “All I Want for Christmas Is You” is one of the most-streamed Christmas songs during the month of December each year. The track is currently at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the first time – 25 years after its original release. Watch “All I Want For Christmas Is You”:
