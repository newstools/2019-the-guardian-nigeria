Ahead of the yuletide, Ogun State Waste Management Authority (OGWAMA) is embarking on a special waste disposal operation, to address cases of indiscriminate dumping of wastes during the festive season. According to a statement signed by the Press Officer of OGWAMA, Mr. Rotimi Oduniyi, the special waste disposal operation, which has the blessing of the state Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, will see massive deployment of waste disposal equipment to nooks and crannies of the state, while waste collectors, sweepers and managers will be on duty throughout the period, thereby forfeiting the holidays for the success of the special operation. The statement therefore enjoined inhabitants and visitors to the state during this festive season and the period of the special waste disposal operation to cooperate with OGWAMA officials by dumping their refuse in waste bins and receptacles scattered throughout the state for effective service delivery. While wishing all a Merry Christmas and a prosperous 2020, the waste authority said it would soon unfold new waste disposal strategies that will make the state, one of the cleanest in the country.
