More than 200 residents of Ilaje, in Bariga area of Lagos State went home with smiles on their faces as they received food items, clothes, medical check ups, sanitary pads, snacks courtesy of Access to Learning and School (ATLAS) initiative in partnership with other non governmental foundations. The outreach with the theme: ‘Christmas with a smile’, took place at the fishing community of Isale Akoka community, Ebute, Ilaje, Lagos. Community leader, Segun Zebulon, expressed his appreciation for the gesture, stating that everybody in the community had something to benefit, as items such as clothes, noodles, rice, and packs for children among other things were freely shared to residents. “I appreciate this outreach, mostly the lectures they gave the teenagers on hygiene and sexual health because it enlightened them on how to take care of themselves,” he said. He noted that the community is getting developed gradually but called for health facility, water and school, as those available don’t serve the entire community. Executive Director, Atlas Initiative, Habib Balogun, said individuals have a responsibility in developing such communities noting that the firm would do more work with the community to ensure they are reoriented. He noted that the outreach is a project of the firm’s sister foundation, April Academy, to put smiles of the faces in less privileged environments. “We want every child here to have access to education and mental and skills empowerment and find solutions for their communities. The constituency leaders should pay more attention to these areas by making them reachable for development,” Balogun added. Managing Partner, Atlas, Modupe Asama, noted that non governmental agencies are to bridge the gap between the government and the people, through going to marginalised communities to educate them on available opportunities.
