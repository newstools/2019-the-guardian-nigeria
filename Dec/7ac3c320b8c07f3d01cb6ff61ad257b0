The outgone chief executive, Prof. Victor Peretomode, yesterday officially handed over to Egwuyenga whose appointment was recently approved by Governor Ifeanyi Okowa. Peretomode, whose five-year tenure ended yesterday, said he introduced several innovations and policies that sanitised academic activities but also fetched him, enemies. During his valedictory media briefing and thanksgiving service at Abraka, he disclosed that under his watch, DELSU became the only public university in the country whose academic calendar was in tandem with international standard due to non-disruption of activities. Peretomode stated that he fought indiscipline to a standstill and had left a legacy of self-discipline, commitment, integrity, and honesty, adding that his low moment was the murder of Miss Elozino Ogege, a 300-level Mass Communication student that was “lured out of the university campus and brutally by suspected ritualists.” He said:  “My greatest regret and saddest moment was the murder of Elozino. I was pained by her death. It was also unfortunate that some persons wanted to blame me for the unfortunate incident even though she was not killed within the university environment.” The ex-VC listed his achievements to include the taming of cultism, review of academic curriculum, building of a 5000-capacity mega library, e-library, roads, staff residences, good relationship between students’ union and university management, introduction of reward mechanism to encourage academic excellence, creation of new programmes/ directorates, improved staff discipline and training of 48 youths from host communities. Peretomode stated that he had no regrets for his policies and the dismissal of some staff for “gross misconduct”, maintaining that “ they were bad eggs and negative influence to the university.” In a related development, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calabar (UNICAL), Prof. Zana Akpagu, has described the institution’s erstwhile Deputy Vice Chancellor (Academic), Prof. Ernest Emenyonu, as a true ambassador. Akpagu, who was represented by the Deputy Vice Chancellor (Academic), Prof. Uche Amalu, stated this during the “Emenyonu@80 Symposium “ organised in honour as part of events marking the 26th International Conference on African Literature and English Language (ICALEL) in Calabar. He commended the first institution’s first emeritus professor for opening UNICAL’s gates to the world through his “outstanding and giant academic strides, especially as the founding father of ICALEL.” Akpagu appreciated the literary icon for serving as one of the early deputy vice chancellors (DVCs). The chairman of the occasion, Prof. Sophia Ogwude, described the celebrant as an “embodiment of humility and a mentor par-excellence” Responding, Prof. Emenyonu, who taught in the institution for over 16 years with his wife, submitted:
“I am here today because Calabar was there yesterday and I was baptised in Igboland and received my first communion in Efikland.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
