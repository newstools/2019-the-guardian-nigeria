Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday said he reached out to his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan, over the attack on his country home. In the telephone conversation, President Buhari expressed sadness over the “tragic and unfortunate attack.” He regretted that a gallant soldier lost his life but commended other soldiers on guard for bravely repelling the attack. “May the soul of the gallant soldier who died in the attack rest in peace,” the president said. Jonathan’s spokesman, Ikechukwu Eze, Jonathan said the attackers came to steal a gunboat stationed 100 meters away from the residence. “A security post stationed near the Otuoke residence of former President Dr. Goodluck Jonathan in Bayelsa State was attacked by unknown gunmen early Tuesday morning,”. Eze said. “The hoodlums who came in about five engine boats stormed the security post located about 100 metres away from former President Jonathan’s residence in his hometown Otuoke by 1:30 am on Tuesday and attempted to take away a gunboat belonging to the military stationed at the creek beside the residence.” Sources said the gunmen came through a riverside checkpoint near the former president’s residence, on five speedboats and opened fire on the soldiers manning the area. Upon being attacked, the soldiers retaliated as they reportedly opened fire on the gunmen. During the gun battle, three of the gunmen were killed, while a soldier also died.
