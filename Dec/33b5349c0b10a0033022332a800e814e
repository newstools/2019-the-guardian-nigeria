Yemi Alade has gifted her fans with a new video for “Lai Lai” off her album Woman of steel released mid-2019. Woman of Steel which turned out to be a perfect blend of different genres; from a Latino vibe in “Give Dem”, Afrobeat numbers like “Vibe”, “Nobody” and highlife gems like “Yeba”, the provocative Duncan Mighty duet “Shake” among others gave the album that unapologetic African tone expected from the renowned Mama Africa. Woman of Steel boasts a modern remake of Angélique Kidjo‘s classic “Wombo Lombo” christened “Shekere”, with the iconic multiple Grammy Award winner. Now her love track “Lai Lai” directed by Paul Gambit further shows Alade in all shades of her nickname “Mama Africa”. Watch Lai Lai below:
