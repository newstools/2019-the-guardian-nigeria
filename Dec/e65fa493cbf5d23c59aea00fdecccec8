The Enugu State police command has rescued a maid, Peace Goewam, recently captured in a viral video where she was being maltreated by her madam. In the video, which elicited wild reactions from Nigerians, Mrs. Amaka Ortolehi, from Ngor-Okpala, Imo State, was seen brutalising her maid, Peace, in a most heartless manner. Enugu Commissioner of Police, Ahmad Abdulrahman, who said he watched the video of the incident, disclosed yesterday that he ordered the manhunt of the woman. He said it was dehumanizing and sad to see the girl being treated the way she did. He said: “I gave order to my technical officers and anti-cult team. This eventually led to her arrest, alongside her husband, Nkemakolam Ortolehi. We also arrested Mr. Jonathan Goewan, uncle to the victim, who out of greed brought her to Enugu from Jos and probably sold her to this wicked family. “Irrationally, she held her own daughter who she had affection for but was thrusting this very girl on the ground as if she was killing a fowl. We have rescued the girl and she is going be to handed over to a government agency that will take care of her till we trace her parents. This is a typical example of child abuse, child labour, torture and man’s inhumanity to man.” Meanwhile, Mrs. Ortelehi, who spoke amid tears, admitted maltreating the young girl and blamed her action on the devil.She said: “I don’t know what came over me. I don’t treat her in such manner before. You can enquire from her school, you can ask our neighbours. This is not how we have been living, I’m a lover of children, all come to my house. Anger put me into this, I love Peace, we have been living together for two years, this is just something that went out of the ordinary.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
