State to recruit education inspectors Ekiti State University (EKSU), Ado Ekiti, has sacked over 600 workers who were allegedly recruited between 2016 and 2017 when Governor Ayodele Fayose was in the saddle over employment irregularities. According to the university, some of the affected workers were also found not to possess the requisite certificates from the primary level, while some were said to be above employment age. The Vice Chancellor, Prof. Edward Olanipekun, told journalists in Ado Ekiti yesterday that the decision was reached after the council met and adopted the report of the external auditors hired to conduct staff audit.He revealed that the university would save over N200 million monthly by expunging the illegal staff from the payroll. “Six hundred and nineteen were illegally recruited between 2016 and 2017. Some were over-aged having clocked 68 or 69 but still working when the statute prescribed 65 for non-academic and 70 for academic staff.“The workers were employed irregularly against university regulations between 2016 and 2018, thereby causing a major personnel misalignment and skyrocketing the university wage bill by about 100 per cent within two years. “The situation was so bad in the university that it was the monthly contributions of members of staff who belong to some cooperative, thrift and credit societies in the university that were partly used by the then university administration to pay the salaries of those that were irregularly employed and who interestingly refused to join any of the societies,” he noted.The institution added that some members of staff presented falsified birth and educational certificates. Meanwhile, to ensure effective monitoring of schools in the state, government plans to recruit Neighborhood Inspectors to improve quality of teaching and learning in the ‘Fountain of Knowledge’.Speaking in Ado Ekiti yesterday during the inauguration of a five-man committee for the recruitment of Neighbourhood Inspectors, the Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Mr. Foluso Daramola, stressed the importance of effective monitoring in schools as a major step towards ensuring academic excellence.He said that Governor Kayode Fayemi was fully committed to the complete overhaul and repositioning of the state’s education sector, saying that one of the major impediments to quality teaching and learning in schools was inadequate monitoring and supervision. The commissioner disclosed that the government was committed to a paradigm shift from the old practice of school inspection to monitoring and evaluating process that would provide a new operation mode of evaluation.Earlier in his remarks, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education Science and Technology, James Owolabi, said that his office received about 350 applications from the 16 councils of the state for the Neighbourhood Inspectors.He urged the committee to do the needful to select the best from the applicants, giving the committee two weeks to carry out its assignment.
