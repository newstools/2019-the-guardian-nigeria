The Kano State Emirate Council Bill 2019 has scaled through first reading at the floor of the Kano State House of Assembly on Tuesday. Presenting the executive bill at the plenary, the clerk of the house, Abdullahi Alfa read the new proposed bill for the recreation of four emirate councils. The bill scaled through the legislators’ acceptance without objection. On Monday, the speaker, Abdul’azeez Garba Gafasa read the letter transmitted to the house by Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje introducing the new bill for the creation of Bichi, Gaya, Karaye and Rano emirate councils. Governor Ganduje’s resolution of the fresh bill was sequel to Justice Usman Na’Abba’s nullification of the emirate councils earlier established by the state. In the declarative judgement of Justice Na’Abba, the Kano Emirs Appointment and Deposition Amendment Law 2019, which was passed by the assembly for the creation of the emirates, was ruled null and void.
