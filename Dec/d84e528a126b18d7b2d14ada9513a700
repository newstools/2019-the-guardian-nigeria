It was a gathering of friends, colleagues and family during the reunion/AGM of Government College, Ojo Old Students Association in Lagos. And besides the drinks and food, there was the trading of plenty memories amidst banters. Appreciating their pioneer principal and teachers decades after graduating from the school, chairman of the reunion committee, Mrs. Nike Fadairo (1980 set), said: “We can’t thank you to our teachers and principal enough. You taught us some really important stuff. We received classic education at that time. We received an education of great value that has sustained us for decades. Highpoint of the reunion was the cutting of the 46th-anniversary cake of the school and presentation of awards to the pioneer principal, Mr. S.B. Salem and some pioneer teachers: Mrs. Johnson, Mrs. Oily, Benson Akingbojule, Mr. Aina and Mr. Babatunde Rotinwa. Others who were awarded were some old students: president of the old students, Tinuke Thanni, Emma Nwogbo, Emmanuel Ofik, Major Gen. Niyi Oyebade (Rtd.) and James Ojo.
