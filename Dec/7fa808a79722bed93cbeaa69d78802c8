The event is Diddyâ€™s 50th birthday and celebrities were invited, this includes Beyonce, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Big Boi, Post Malone, and Tyga to mention a few. After years of not feuding, it seems Jay-Z and Kanye have buried the hatchet when one of the guests captured the moment the duo stood beside each other and started talking according to hip-hop news. Before now, the two music stars were once very close and did some projects together. However, things went sour in 2016 when Kanye accused Jay-Z and Beyonce of being bad friends. This did not go down well with Jay-Z as he dropped some lines for him on his album 4:44, where he said Kanye is insane. In an interview in 2017 with Rap Radar, he stated he would have settled things with Kanye if he had not brought his family into the issues which is where Kanye crossed the line. Even there had been attempts to end the feud, this is the first time the duo would be seen in public with all smiles and of course, a handshake.
