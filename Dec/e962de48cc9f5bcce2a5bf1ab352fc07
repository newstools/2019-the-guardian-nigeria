A goal by Clement Ogwu in the 42nd minute from the penalty spot after a foul on Tunde Azeez and a brace by second half substitute, Alade Balogun in the 74th and 82nd minute, ensured that the Olukoya’s Boys secured their first home victory over The Promise Keepers. Speaking to The Guardian yesterday, Bolus said his game plan was beginning to yield dividend, adding that the performance of his boys over their opponent was a welcome development, and a relief from the pressure from the home fans. “The match against Akwa United went well as we expected because we won 3-0. What we have been working on the team has started paying off. “The level of confidence in the team has now increased and the conviction in the team is back. My boys actually started the season well, but along the line they couldn’t sustain it. Now, we are coming up again,” he said. An excited Bolus, who expressed gratitude to the fans for their support, added that, “We want to appreciate our fans for believing in us and we promise them more victories ahead home and away in the premier league,” he said.
