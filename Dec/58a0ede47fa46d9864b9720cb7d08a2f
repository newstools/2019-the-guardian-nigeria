Deadpool 3 | Image: The Epoch Times Fans of the wisecracking antihero Deadpool can now breathe easy as actor and producer Ryan Reynolds has confirmed that Deadpool 3 is in the works at Marvel. There have been speculation surrounding the release of a third Deadpool film following Disney’s acquisition of 21st Century Fox, the company responsible for the first two films. Appearing on a holiday edition of “Live With Kelly and Ryan,” Reynolds told hosts Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest that his potty-mouthed superhero is returning with another sequel in the blockbuster franchise. “We’re working on it right now with the whole team,” Reynolds said. “We’re over at Marvel (Studios), which is the big leagues all of a sudden. It’s kind of crazy. So yeah, we’re working on it.” The two Deadpool films are among the highest-grossing R-rated films ever made. “Deadpool” and “Deadpool 2” earned an impressive $1.5 billion worldwide combined. Budgets were a reported $58 million and $110 million, respectively, before marketing costs. Disney CEO Bob Iger said he’s happy to keep the series rated R. “We will continue in that business,” he said in February, adding that “there’s certainly popularity” for R-rated superhero movies.
