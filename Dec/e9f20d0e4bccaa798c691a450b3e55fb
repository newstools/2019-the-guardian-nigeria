He noted that the Commission’s focus is not to work on the products, but on the processes so that results will speak for themselves.He continued: “In 2020, we shall take a closer look at the manufacturing sector, beverage industries; we will look at them one by one and how they produce their goods, sell and how far they satisfy their consumers.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
