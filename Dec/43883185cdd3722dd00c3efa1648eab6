The World Health Organisation (WHO) has confirmed 13 cases of Yellow Fever, which has resulted in three deaths in four local government areas of Plateau State.
  
WHO State Coordinator, Wonk Vingey Bassey, confirmed the incident while presenting a report on a survey conducted on affected councils during an emergency stakeholders’ meeting in Jos.
  
The meeting followed the outbreak of the disease in Jos North, Bassa, Riyom and Wase local government areas of the state.
  
Bassey, who gave the breakdown according to councils, said the deaths were recorded in Wase local government.
  
The coordinator, represented by the consultant, Elizabeth Ahinchi, advocated early inspection and reporting of cases of the outbreak, in addition to intensified routine campaigns in communities.
  
State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Ninkwom Ndam, said the state government is working in collaboration with Federal authority and other partners to strengthen healthcare services to citizens.
  
Also, Executive Secretary, Plateau State Healthcare Board, Dr. Livinus Niamkwap, noted that the recent outbreak in the four councils calls for pro-active measures to avert escalation to other areas.
   
Participants at the meeting discussed extensively on the way forward, laying emphasis on the need for the provision of mosquito nets, surveillance, awareness campaigns in media stations and worship centres, as well as financial support, among others.
