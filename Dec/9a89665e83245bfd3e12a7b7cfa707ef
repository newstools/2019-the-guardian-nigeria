Despite the threat by Olisa Agbakoba (SAN) to secure an injunction to stop singer Oluwatobiloba Daniel Anidugbe, popularly known as Kizz Daniel, from hosting his live concert on Boxing Day, the legal team of the artiste has assured Nigerians and the sponsors that the show will go on. Olisa Agbakoba (SAN) had on December 13, 2019, threatened to stop the Kizz Daniel Live concert following what he described as a breach of the mandatory buy-out clause and infringement of intellectual property. The firm is also demanding the sum of N500 million as compensation to G-Worldwide Entertainment.
 
Speaking at a press briefing in which the artiste himself was absent, Partner and Head of litigation at the L&A Legal Consultant and Solicitor, Oluwaseye Lawal, said his client did not at any time breach the contract he signed with the record label. “I will like to put on notice that as a law firm that has been on Intellectual Property (IP) for more than 20 years and have worked with the best of the best in the entertainment industry, we are constrained and forced to clear the air on the case between G-WorldWide and Kizz Daniel. As a law firm that is at the forefront of Intellectual property right and entertainment for more than two decades, we do not hug the camera; we always stay behind because we believe that a good lawyer should talk more in court and not outside the court. However, certain events in the last few weeks have forced us to come out. Not particularly because of the case between Kizz Daniel and his former record label, but for the generality of the IP rights ecosystem.
