Kano State Government has banned persons of opposite genders from boarding same commercial tricycles across the state. The directive will take effect from January, 2020, a Kano State official said on Wednesday at the closing ceremony of 77th annual Islamic Vacation Course (IVC) organised by Zone A of Muslim Society of Nigeria (MSSN) held at Bayero University, Kano. The Commander General of Hisbah Board, Harun Ibn-Sina, representing the state governor, said the state government is committed to upholding Islamic values. Commercial tricycles, popularly known as ‘A daidaita sahu’ in Kano, were introduced by a former governor of Kano, Ibrahim Shekarau, as a means of transportation for women only. This was after Shekarau’s government banned commercial motorcyclists from conveying women. But since Shekarau’s exit as governor, tricycles have been carrying people of both sexes.
