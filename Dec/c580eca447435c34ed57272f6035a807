Mutiu, aged 37, allegedly started beating his wife in the morning on Christmas Day over a minor disagreement and despite being told by neighbours to desist from further assaulting his wife, a furious Mutiu kept hitting her with blows until the 34-year-old woman slumped to the ground and slipped into coma.
