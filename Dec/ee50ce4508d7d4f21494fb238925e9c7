The Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Yusuf Buratai yesterday said the Nigerian Army would turn the dreaded Kamuku/Kuyanbana forest in Birnin-Gwari, Kaduna State into training ground. The forest spanning between Kaduna, Katsina, Zamfara and Niger states has for long been a hideout for criminal elements such as kidnappers and bandits terrorizing the bordering states. Buratai, who made this known in his remarks at the closing ceremony of the Cheif of Army Staff Confrence 2019 in Kaduna said, “we will make use of the Kamuku/Kuyanbana forest to ensure that we dominate it and make it our training area. “I have directed the Chief of Army Administration to commence establishment of Army command secondary school in Kaduna.” He added. He also charged commanders to be conscious and make judicious use of resources under their charge while discharging their responsibilities, saying: “I will not hesitate to personally hold you responsible and accountable for any form of indiscipline and misconduct.” Governor Nasir El-Rufai who was the Guest of Honour on the occasion praised the Army for ensuring Nigeria remains united. “We have a Nigerian army that has never been more committed at ensuring peace all through the country and keeping the country most united at its trying moments. “Nigeria will not forget and I can assure you that Kaduna State will not forget your sacrifices. “I am happy that transformation of the Army taking place in spite of daunting challenges. We are also happy that the Army has come up with world-class innovations. “I have no doubt that in no distant future, the Nigerian Army will be self sufficient in production of their needs.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
