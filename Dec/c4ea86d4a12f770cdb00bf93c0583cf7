But concerns over the fitness of the five-time losing Australian Open finalist were raised when he cancelled a scheduled block of training in Miami. As a result, he won’t be back at Melbourne Park, the scene of an emotional press conference this year where he suggested he might retire as a result of his hip injury. Despite being less than fully fit Murray played a gruelling five-set loss to Roberto Bautista Agut. A fortnight later the double Olympic gold medallist, twice a Wimbledon champion and the winner of the 2012 US Open singles had hip resurfacing surgery and started his return to action at the Queen’s Club grass-court event in London in June. October saw Murray win the European Open in Antwerp, a victory that suggested he could still contend for major honours. But the latest announcement means he will not play again until February at the earliest. “I know how excited Andy was about coming back to compete in Australia in January, and how disappointed he is not to make it for 2020,” said Tennis Australia chief Craig Tiley, who praised his “determination and iron will”. “Although we will miss him in January, we wish him all the very best for his recovery and look forward to seeing him back on court very soon.” The Australian Open takes place from January 20-February 2 with the ATP Cup acting as the new men’s lead-up tournament in Sydney, Perth and Brisbane for 10 days from January 3.
