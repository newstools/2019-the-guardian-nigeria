The Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) has debunked speculations that the government’s visa on arrival policy was not to victimise an ethnic or religious group in the country. Responding to social media reports on the policy which takes off in next year where it was speculated that the initiative was to allegedly allow Africans from Muslim nations to come into Nigeria without visa, spokesman of the agency, Sunday James, said the speculations were unfounded and baseless. “How is it even possible for such rumours to be true? It is even unthinkable that people can reason like this.” What are those so-called Africans from the said Muslim countries coming to do? he queried “We work hard to ensure that we improve on service delivery and someone somewhere just sits and starts making up stories. This rumour should be disregarded,” James urged. According to the government, visa on arrival is an effort to accelerate African integration and bring down barriers to free movement within the continent.
