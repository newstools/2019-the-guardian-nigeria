The bears upstaged the bulls at the end of yesterday’s transactions on the equities sector of the Nigeria Stock Exchange (NSE), causing the All Share Index (ASI) to depreciate by 0.13 percent.
   
ASI fell by 34.74 points or 0.13 percent to 26,660.44 points, causing investors to lose N16 billion in value as market capitalisation fell to N12.868 trillion.
   
The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which were; Dangote Cement, NASCON Allied Industries, International Breweries, UPDC Real Estate Investment Trust (UPDCREIT), and Lafarge Africa. Analysts at Afrinvest Limited, said: “We do not expect a sustainable rebound in the equities market in the near term, as investor sentiment towards equities remain sour.”
   
The Chief Research Officer of Investdata Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omodion, said: “We expect a sustained mixed performance amidst profit-taking, as investors take advantage of low prices to position, ahead of the usual Santa Claus and year-end rally, as capital flow and repositioning in value stocks continue.
   
“There is also the changing sentiment in the expectation of improved liquidity and positive economic indices. Again, the current undervalued state of the market offers investors opportunities to position for short and medium-to-long-term horizons.“We expect that investors would target fundamentally-sound and dividend-paying stocks for possible capital appreciation as the year draws down to usher in 2020.”
