Lagos State governorship candidate of Alliance for Democracy (AD) in the 2019 election, Chief Owolabi Salis, has expressed belief in the judicial system, adding that the truth cannot be suppressed. He reiterated that the last governorship election was marked by many irregularities, hence he was denied victory where he won. Salis told The Guardian in Lagos yesterday, “I believe in Nigeria’s judicial system and I have strong faith that the truth cannot be suppressed.” He asserted that he played fair during the election and would not hesitate to contest any form of irregularity at the law court. Ifako Ijaiye is an area where AD has numerous strong party loyalists, he said, alleging that the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) collaborated with the All Progressives Congress (APC) to commit a blatant error of allotting the party zero votes in the area. His words, “We will not stop in our bid to seek justice for Lagosians and liberate them from the APC. We are coming to take what rightfully belongs to us and (Governor Babajide) Sanwo-Olu should be prepared to vacate that seat because it was never rightfully his.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
