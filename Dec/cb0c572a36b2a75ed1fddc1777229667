A federal high court in Abuja Thursday ordered Nigeria’s secret police to release the publisher of SaharaReporters within 24 hours. The court also awarded N100,000 against the prosecution for failing to comply with court orders requesting the release of Sowore and for not serving the defense counsel with necessary documents early enough. The penalty, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu said, must be paid to the defendants before the commencement of trial. The judge consequently adjourned hearing till Friday. “This matter cannot go on,” Justice Ojukwu said. “There is no way it can go on, and the adjournment is at your instance.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
