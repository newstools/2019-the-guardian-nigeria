In the message, Offset confesses that he misses her. Jade shared a video of her checking her phone to show it was a message from Offset’s account and added: “Your wife @iamcardib has an OPEN CRIMINAL CASE, why are you writing me you don’t respect her ???????” However, Cardi-B has come out to say it was not Offset that sent the message, rather, her husband’s media account was hacked. To prove it, Cardi shared a couple of videos with Offset, saying they were up sick with their kid all night and stood her ground saying her husband didn’t do what Jade claims. She also revealed a couple of screenshots from Twitter and Instagram, seemingly proving he was hacked and is unable to log in to his accounts. Also, around the time the message was sent to Jade, there were some odd messages being tweeted on Offset’s account, these messages include: “I am gay”, “I lick ass cheeks,” which shows the account might have been hacked. However, Jade has confirmed she has more dirt on Offset and will share the eviv=dence to the public. In her words: “Theirs a lot of s**t I haven’t exposed yet.” No one knows if Cardi-B and Offset’s side of the story is true because some opined Offset sent those tweets when he discovered he might have done what he is not supposed to.
