Cross River State Governor, Ben Ayade has declared the 2019 Carnival Calabar opens with the theme ‘Humanity’ to show kindness and love. Ayade, who flagged off the biggest street party, decked in colourful attire, in the company of his wife, said the world has lost the value of humanity, replacing it with wickedness. He said when God created humanity, it was for a purpose, but that purpose was not fulfilled. The governor said: “When God created mankind, He created us for peace. His own image, He made man for the beauty of the world. He sent His only son to die for us, but in the course of man habitation on earth, man has deviated completely.” He said the theme was chosen for this year’s carnival to show the world that everyone has the ability to show humanity to his or her fellow man whether black or white. “God created for a purpose which is to bring value to the societ, as well as humanity. Humanity is the only religion that the world should embrace, and once humanity becomes a religion, we will as a people collectively rise above life’s vicissitudes. Humanity is insensitive to religion because with it, we can always provide a shoulder for one another to lean on,” Ayade said.
