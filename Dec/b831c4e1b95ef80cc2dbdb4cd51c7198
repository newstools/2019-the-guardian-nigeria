 Super Eagles’ Manager, Gernot Rohr  According to the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), the deal will spell out certain conditions, which the German must adhere to, to avoid the issues that have dogged the national team and the coach’s relationship with the federation. NFF President, Amaju Pinnick told journalists in Benin during the federation’s 75th Annual General Assembly that should Rohr decline the new offer, the federation would swiftly get a new manager. Rohr, who became Super Eagles manager in August 2016, qualified Nigeria for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia and won bronze at the 2019 African Cup of Nations in Egypt. His current deal will expire in June 2020. Pinnick said, “We are going to present the contract proposal to Rohr next month and we have already mandated the first Vice-President to constitute the legal team to draft the new proposal, which will be made available to the coach next month.” Pinnick expressed the NFF’s desire to retain Rohr as Super Eagles’ manager, adding, however, that in the negotiations, Nigeria’s interest would be paramount. He added: “If we don’t want him to continue as Eagles manager, we would not even contemplate drafting a new proposal for him, but we are okay with him. We only want to institute some things that would protect the interest of Nigeria and its football in the new contract. “That is why we are starting next month so that he can have enough time to study the offer and accept. If he does not accept our new offer as Timaya said, ‘’I cannot kill myself’ and we would shop for a new manager to take over.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
