The crisis rocking the Ekiti State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday took a new turn as the Legal Adviser of the party, Sunday Olowolafe disagreed with the party’s chairman, Gboyega Oguntuase on the alleged sale of the party’s Secretariat complex.
   
Fayose had said recently while meeting with the party members across the 16 local governments of the state that the secretariat was sold with active involvement of the State Working Committee (SWC). Fayose alleged that the proceeds from the sales, which were in two installments, were paid into the party’s account. Reacting to the claim by Fayose while briefing newsmen in Ado Ekiti, the PDP Chairman, Gboyega Oguntuase described the allegation as misleading, malicious, and condemnable. He said that contrary to Fayose’s claim that the secretariat was sold at foundation level, Oguntuase insisted that the SWC monitored the construction up to the second and third floor and if Fayose sold the property, the party would use legal means to retrieve the property from whomever it was sold to. But countering the PDP Chairman, in a statement, Olowolafe said Oguntuase’s allegation was ridiculous, unfounded and baseless. “Two documents which showed that the party’s SWC got a refund of N25 million from one Rachael Ajayi on January 18, 2017 had absolved Fayose. The three signatures on the said documents were those of Oguntuase and Secretary of the party, Tope Adejorin.” He said Oguntuase was being clever by half with his denial and unfounded allegation against Fayose.“The letter was also signed by Oguntuase, Adejorin and myself as the legal Adviser. When the money was remitted into the Party’s account in Heritage Bank and acknowledged by the party, we were all there.Yet he claimed not to be aware, all in his desperation to malign Fayose, his benefactor despite incontrovertible documentary evidences.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
