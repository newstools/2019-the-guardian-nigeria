Enrollees that are currently participating in the Employees Compensation Scheme (ECS), operated by the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF), has grown by 45 per cent since 2017 when President Muhammadu Buhari appointed the present management team.
  
The Managing Director and Chief Executive of NSITF, Adebayo Somefun, who disclosed this at the International Arts and Crafts Expo (INAC), in Abuja, explained that apart from the contribution growing by 45 per cent from 2017 to date, about 100,000 employers have keyed into the scheme so far.
  
Somefun added that the scheme presently covers over 6.9 million employees from inception to date.  He hinted that the Fund is working in partnership with the National Council for Occupational Safety & Health, for the prevention of occupational diseases and the promotion of safety and health culture in the workplace.
   
The NSITF helmsman said the scheme does not only benefit employees directly but saying employers also derive direct benefits. 
   
He explained: “The NSITF refunds medical expenses incurred on employees. Indeed employers are also compensated for the loss of productivity. The Scheme relieves the employer of the heavy burden of solely taking care of the injured workers. The scheme also maintains payment of compensation whether the employer is liquid or not. Payment to the injured worker is made regularly without recourse to the employer, no matter the amount of liability. Above all, the scheme is boosting national productivity by ensuring that the workforce is healthy, and work without inhibition knowing a scheme is there for them in case of occupational hazards.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
