President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated Nigerian entrepreneur, Temi Giwa-Tubosun, the inaugural winner of the Africa Business Hero Award, founded by renowned Chinese technology entrepreneur, Jack Ma. The Award, accompanied by a cash prize of $250,000, is only the latest in a series of inspiring wins by Giwa-Tubosun in recent years, and is testament to the vision and doggedness, which had helped grow the Startup she founded, LifeBank, into an organisation to reckon with on Nigeria’s and Africa’s healthcare and technology landscapes. The President, according to a statement by the Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, acknowledged the huge impact LifeBank has made in a relatively short time, by delivering blood, oxygen, and other medical products to hospitals in a timely and efficient manner, thus helping save countless lives. Buhari also reiterated his administration’s commitment to creating the right environment for businesses and innovations to thrive in the country. The President assured that efforts put in place so far, which have seen Nigeria rise to 39 places on the World Bank’s Doing Business Index in the last three years, will be pursued even more vigorously. He added that his administration will continue its active engagement with leading minds in the technology and creative sectors, including through the Advisory Group on Technology and Creativity, under the National Industrial Policy and Competitiveness Advisory Council chaired by the Vice President. President Buhari also urged Nigerian youths to emulate Giwa-Tubosun’s can-do spirit and problem-solving approach, as well as her firm belief in the potential of her fatherland.He wished her even greater successes in the months and years ahead, and urged her to use this latest recognition as a stepping stone to even more impactful and transformative work.
