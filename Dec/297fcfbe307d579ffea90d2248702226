Here are the highlights of the wonderful time we had on the set and making of Breaking Point the Movie; The Amazing Cast
One can say the Casting team did a fantastic job as every actor picked, suited the roles they were given perfectly which made for a smooth interpretation of the robust characters to be played in the movie. With over 12 A-list Actors, it was a seamless interpretation of roles and a very enjoyable working experience all round. The rivalry between Shaffy Bello (Mrs. Akintola) and Tina Mba (Mrs. Okafor) is a fiery one alongside equally captivating lead actor Bolanle Ninalowo (Dozie) who plays Mrs Okafor’s son. Following the success of Elevator Baby, Shaffy Bello & Timini are beginning to become the preferred mother and son duo of Nollywood and they once again created their magic on set and delivered an award-winning performance. Locations and Props
As we all know, beautiful places make even more beautiful pictures and the stellar job done by the location and props crew would have one amazed at the attention to detail and the portraying of Lagos as a world-class city befitting of the opulent lifestyle of the characters in the movie.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1086572 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-2-1.png" alt="" width="628" height="628" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-2-1.png 628w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-2-1-598x598.png 598w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-2-1-100x100.png 100w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-2-1-200x200.png 200w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-2-1-487x487.png 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-2-1-240x240.png 240w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-2-1-480x480.png 480w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-2-1-600x600.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px" /> Story is Superb
The story is relatable in today’s contemporary society – We saw how a young lady had a mindset of sacrificing all it takes and absorbing the pains and abuses of her relationship to the reward of marrying from a wealthier class based on her mother’s continued reminders that wealth is the only source of marital happiness. Another great element to this movie is the entertainment meets tech aspect which encourages the vastly growing number of African youths who are striving to be leaders and innovators to continue in the pursuit of creativity, self-determination and personal discovery.
This movie embodies the major elements of the average personal life of people today; Business rivalry, Love, Hatred, Glamour and Parenting. Use of Lighting
Going by the unmatched pedigree of the direction team Adams GUD & Oke Abiola, there is no doubt that the standard of lighting is world-class. The Ace directors worked closely with other technical crew members to ensure the best quality for your viewing pleasure. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1086589 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-7.png" alt="" width="580" height="332" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-7.png 580w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-7-487x279.png 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-7-320x183.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /> Alte New School Actors

We painstakingly sourced some of the best equipment in the world of image capturing, movie production and editing so as to create the crispest, clear and aesthetically pleasing picture experience for our befitting audience. Plot Twist
The plot twist in this movie is unprecedented, as we see an impressive depiction of previously nonchalant Timini Egbuson become a business and techy personality with an innovative app with the help of his friend in the agricultural sector. The twist also saw a happy-go-lucky Kemi Akintola devolving into a psychotic rage due to an unexpected twist of fate. Costuming & Make up
Sodiq Ayinde & Adella did a great job in putting up stylish, glamorous and appropriate looks for all actors for the duration of production – Adella is known for her beautiful painting in King of Boys pictures. However speaking with CEO of Vidi360, Ifedayo Oniyide expresses his gratitude towards the Actors and crew member stating that “the actors never stopped amazing me, aside the fact that I have a personal relationship with most of them, they were able to give us a professional delivery which is one of our core beliefs at our firm. Their level of humility and the courteous interactions between our crew members, actors and executives onset and even after, has been amazing so far” I believe we have had a satisfying and amazing production and we cant wait to share the visuals with everyone. Recall that Ifedayo Oniyide was formerly the man behind Mavin Records media and promotions wheel.
