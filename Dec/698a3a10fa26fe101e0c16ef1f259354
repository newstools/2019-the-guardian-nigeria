The Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria (FRC), has called on the Federal Government to urgently intervene in the disputed landed property at Guzape, Federal Capital Territory (FCT).
 
The Executive Secretary of FRC, Daniel Asapokhai, who made the appeal during the Council’s visit to the FCT Minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, noted that the body has not been able to carry out any meaningful development on the property due to the activities of squatters.
 
He said unlike other Federal Government agencies, the Council operates primarily from Lagos.  Bello said: “Based on your presentation and the letter you presented that I have glanced, I understand what the issues are. We will try our very best to support you to see how this matter will be brought to a conclusion.
 
“I have personally followed the activities of FRC, and I think the reason for establishing the Council is very important, particularly at the stage we are now as a developing country,” he said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
