Presenting a report to the Senate earlier yesterday, chairman of the Appropriation Committee, Barau Jibrin, disclosed that his panel worked harmoniously with the executive arm of government in the processing of the bill “which ensured the collaboration of the two arms in the utilization of additional revenue projections to fund/improve the funding of some critical projects which could not be adequately funded in the budget proposals submitted by Mr. President due to constraints.” “Consequently, the increase allowed for interventions in critical areas such as national security, road infrastructure, mines and steel development, health, social needs, and water. This is also in line with the budget thrust of the government which is sustainable growth and development,” Jibrin said. The lawmakers took turns to advise the executive arm of government on the execution of the projects provided for in the budget.
Former Deputy President of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, drew attention to the ravaging problems of poverty and unemployment in the country, pointing out that the diligent execution of budgets would be helpful in resolving the challenges. Fatai Buhari (APC, Oyo State) stated:

So all the committees must go to work to ensure that revenues expected are realized.” In the House of Representatives, the lawmakers also passed the 2020 budget to the tune of N10, 594,362, 364,830 trillion.The decision followed the adoption of the report of the appropriation committee submitted by the chairman, Mr. Muktar Betara, at the plenary presided over by Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila.
