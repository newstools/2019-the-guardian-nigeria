Veronica Duque | @mikemoratinos on Twitter A teacher Verónica Duque has earned the admiration of thousands online for going out of her way to use her body to help her students understand her teachings during an anatomy class. Duque who has been teaching for 15 years dressed up in a full-body suit which showed the placement of organs in her body after realising her young pupils struggled to understand the concept. Taking to Twitter to share the photos of his wife teaching the class of 8-9-year-olds, her husband praised her in Spanish. His caption translated into English reads: Veronica Duque<br /> | @mikemoratinos on Twitter “Very proud of this volcano of ideas that I am lucky to have as a woman. Today she explained the human anatomy to her students in a very original way. And the kids [were] freaking out. Great Verónica!” The post attracted more than 65,000 likes and 13,000 retweets, with many praising Duque’s creativity. Many have also called on other teachers to follow her example as this is not the only ingenious way Duque teaches her students. She often surprises her students in other ways, including wearing disguises when she takes history lessons to bring the subject to life.
