Shogo Ando | PM News A 9-year-old boy identified as Shogo Ando in the Kansai region has proven himself to be a whizkid after he passed a university-level mathematics test. The fourth-grader in Nishinomiya, Hyogo Prefecture has now set a record by becoming the youngest student to pass a university-level mathematics test, the test organizer, The Mathematics Certification Institute of Japan, said today, December 10. Ando passed Suken’s top-level 1st Kyu test held in October and beat the previous record set by Hiroto Takahashi, who passed the test as an 11-year-old last year. According to the institute’s website, the test is available in 14 levels, ranging from preschool-level to college-level, and more than 350,000 people take the test every year. The 1st Kyu test covers a wide range of subjects including multivariable functions and metric linear spaces. The institute also revealed Ando started studying for Suken when he was about 7. “I want to use my mathematics knowledge and contribute to society through research, such as stopping global warming,” the boy was quoted by the institute as saying. According to the Kyodo news agency, the institute said Ando intends to use his mathematical skills for the betterment of the society. The report said the boy was quoted as saying that he would like to use his skills to combat climate change. The pass rate for the most recent 1st Kyu test was 14.4 percent, the institute said. According to date from the Programme for International Student Assessment, Japan has fallen from fifth to sixth place in the ranking of countries by their school pupils’ maths abilities. Ando’s intelligence is not the only child genius behaviour to be exhibited. We reported earlier of Esther Okade, a Nigerian-British maths genius who enrolled in college at 10. At just six years old, she was already taking her maths GCSE, generally undertaken by 14- to 16-year-olds in the United Kingdom, and getting a C.
