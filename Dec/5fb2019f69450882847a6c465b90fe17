Speaker of House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, has assured Nigerians that the Ninth National Assembly would sustain the feat it achieved by early passage of the 2020 budget next year by passing the Petroleum Industry Governance Bill (PIGB) and giving the country a new Electoral Act next year.
 
He also disclosed that in keeping with his determination to provide proper leadership, he has released the sum of N2billion for the establishment of an Electronic Library for the National Assembly, stressing that since the greatest library in the world is Library of Congress in the United States, they’re prepared to equip members with knowledge.
 
The Speaker made the assertions, yesterday, in his remarks at the opening ceremony of a two-day Seminar for chairmen of House Standing Committees, holding in Lagos. Also speaking at the seminar, which was organized by the National Institute of Legislative and Democratic Studies (NILDS), Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, noted that legislatures fulfill a number of important functions in a democracy, pointing out that as the peoples branch of government, the institution is key to achieving the democratic potential embodied in free and fair elections. He observed that without effective mechanisms of representation, legislators cannot be democratic and are not likely to act in the interest of society as a whole, even as he made a case for women lawmakers to be appointed into committee chairmanship positions.
