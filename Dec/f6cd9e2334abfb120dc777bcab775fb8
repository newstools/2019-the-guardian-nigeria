• Confer corporate governance awards to Dangote Cement, Nigerian Breweries
Plans are underway by the Institute of Directors (IoD) Nigeria, to collaborate with colleagues in the Organised Private Sector (OPS), to chart paths that will lead to the achievement of more public-private sector engagement on policy directions. Scheduled to commence in the coming year, IoD said, the mindset is to lead a new vista of engagement with government, which will eschew confrontation but embrace diplomacy and partnership. The Institute’s President and Chairman of Governing Council, Chris Okunowo, said this during its annual directors’ dinner and awards night 2019. He said: “Our plan is to ensure that in all our advocacy and intervention programmes, we present ourselves as partners in progress, who have as much stake in the progress and prosperity of our country as any elected or career public servant.” Giving a highlight on activities during the out-going year, and how the Institute fared, Okunowo noted it was a challenging year for businesses and the country as a whole. He said the Institute has been involved in the process of making sure Nigerian business community has the opportunity to make its views known through representation to government, and advocating in its own way for the entrenchment of good corporate governance in the country. Besides, he said the Institute has also provided substantive and considered views to some of the issues affecting the local business environment and the economy as a whole, by spreading the gospel of good governance to the public sector through various engagements with relevant offices and agencies of government. In his remarks, Group Executive Chairman, BUA Group, Isyaku Rabiu, said as the year gradually winds down, directors are optimistic and well-poised to navigate the challenges in the year and take greater advantage of the opportunities in the Year 2020. He said with the support of institutions, organisations and businesses, challenges in the coming year would be surmountable, and urged everyone to come together and harness endowed Nigeria’s natural resources as well as address the challenges confronting the citizenry. He noted that the landscape of corporate governance has changed in Nigeria, and commended the IoD on its leading role in directing corporate governance structure in Nigeria. At the event, Dangote Cement Plc. and the Nigerian Breweries Plc. won the Institute’s corporate governance awards in the manufacturing sector. The Corporate Governance Award is a collaborative effort between the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), and IoD Nigeria, to promote and inculcate compliance to good corporate governance and best practices in the companies listed on the Exchange.
