Harry Styles is wistful and reminisces about his past feelings for an ex in his new song, “Cherry”. The former One Direction bandmate appears to address his split from French model, Camille Rowe. The singer recently dropped a new album “Fine Line” but it is the track, “Cherry” that has got fans talking as he sounds like he is not over his 2018 split from Rowe. “I just miss your accent and your friends,” Harry sings on “Cherry,” before adding “Did you know I still talk to them?” Although he didn’t mention Rowe’s name, it is not hard to put two and two together when she starts speaking French on the song! “Coucou! Tu dors? Oh, j’suis désolé… Bah non… Nan c’est pas marrant,” she says, according to Genius (which translates to “Hello! Are you asleep? Oh, I’m sorry…Well, no… It’s not funny”). Styles also shows a jealous side on the bittersweet track. Speaking to Zane Lowe of Apple Music’s Beats 1. about “Cherry”, Styles says: “I wanted it to be true to the moment that I wrote it, and how I was feeling then [which was] not great,” he said, according to Billboard. “It’s so pathetic in a way. The night that I wrote it, I was saying that I was feeling a lot of pressure because the last record wasn’t a radio record. And I was like, ‘I feel like this record has to be really big. So I feel like I need to make certain songs.’ And Tyler [Johnson, producer] just said to me, ‘You just have to make the record that you want to make right now.’ So then we stayed up and wrote ‘Cherry’ that night.” He also confirmed that it was an “ex-girlfriend” at the end of the song. “We’re friends and stuff, so I asked her if it was okay. I think she liked it,” he said, without specifying which ex-girlfriend it was, but Metro reported that the voice speaks French, so it’s easy to put two and two together. Listen to “Cherry” below:
