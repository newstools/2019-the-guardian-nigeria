Fresh from their 1-0 defeat of Cote d’Ivoire’s San Pedro FC in their second game of the CAF Confederation Cup, defending champions, Enyimba will return to the Nigeria Professional Football League (today). Their target is a victory over Rivers United that will take them to the second position on the NPFL table. The going has not been too easy for Enyimba in the continent, but they have been within touch of the NPFL log leaders since week three of the competition. Against a Rivers United side that have lost just once all season, Enyimba have to be at their best to get the three points. Looking forward to another successful day in office, Enyimba Manager, Usman Abd’Allah said although Rivers United have always been a tough customer, he expects his boys to get the win they desire. “They will come here and try to make it difficult for us as usual, but we have already known (what they will do) and that is why we have been working hard,” he said. Rivers United’s Manager, Stanley Eguma is, however, not bothered by Enyimba’s ambitions. Rather, he wants the three points that would shoot his team to the third position on the log. He said, “Enyimba is always strong, especially when they play at home, but we recall what happened when we met them in pre-season against them. “We dominated against them in Aba and they scored with a penalty in the 1-1 draw, while we beat them in Port Harcourt.“We know this Enyimba team very well and have perfected out tactics for the game,” he said.
