Nigeria’s hope to host the FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup 2020 ended on Friday after Costa Rica and Panama were named joint-host of the football competition. “Following on from a FIFA inspection visit to Costa Rica and Panama as well as further discussions with the two relevant member associations, the Bureau of the FIFA Council has today confirmed that the FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup 2020 will be played in August in Costa Rica and Panama,” FIFA said on its website. With this announcement, Costa Rica and Panama are the first joint-host of a FIFA youth tournament- the second co-hosting of a FIFA tournament since the 2002 FIFA World Cup Korea/Japan. FIFA’s Chief Women’s Football Officer Sarai Bareman said the U20WWC in Costa Rica and Panama next year will be a perfect opportunity to continue driving the popularity of the game. Baremen said FIFA is optimistic that the tournament will bring “greater impact” to the game. FIFA’s Chief Tournaments and Events Officer Colin Smith commended Costa Rican and Panamanian football associations for their commitment towards women’s football and the FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup in particular. “We are looking forward to a fantastic competition in August,” Smith said. The 16 participating teams in the tournament will be divided into four groups of four with the best two of each group advancing to the quarter-finals. FIFA said the number of stadiums to be used for the FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup Costa Rica and Panama 2020 will be discussed and confirmed with the two-member associations. “Details on the tournament’s time frame and match schedule will follow,” FIFA said.
