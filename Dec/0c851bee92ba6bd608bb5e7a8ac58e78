Arteta, recently appointed as Arsenal’s full-time manager, confirmed he would love to have Ljungberg as part of his team. “I spoke to Freddie after the game,” Arteta said, adding that “I told him my idea and the people I wanted to bring to form my coaching staff, their roles and responsibilities of each of them.” “I wanted to know what he was feeling, I wanted to know what he had in mind, what his expectations were,” he said. Arteta watched from the stands as Ljungberg took charge of his sixth and final game as our interim head coach, away to Everton on Saturday. But Arteta will be in charge of the Boxing Day game with Bournemouth on Thursday and Ljungberg will join him as one of his coaching staff. “I think he can be very available, I think he knows the players, he knows the situation, he knows the history of where we’re coming from and also his knowledge of the game is going to really help us to be better. “I knew him a little bit before obviously, and we will start a new chapter now with new ideas, new ways of doing things. I got a really good impression. He’s ready to help. He was very positive.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
