“…I don’t dance now, I make money moves…” The lyrics above are from Grammy award-winning rapper, Cardi B’s hit song, “Bodak Yellow” and although she may no longer dance (at least not in a strip club), he still has a love for the strip club. The former exotic dancer who is currently in Lagos (perhaps as a reminder of her own days as an exotic dancer) can be seen in a Lagos strip club and she makes it rain money. As she sprays the bills on happy fans, her husband, Offset’s song, “Clout” on which she is a featured artist plays in the background before it switches to another of her hit songs, “I Like It”. In another video shared on her Instastory, she is seen resting her face on a twerking stripper’s face as she sprays more cash. The dancer moves from spraying money to showing off some dance moves as she grinds to the songs playing in the background. Interestingly, Nigerian-American artist, Jidenna who is also currently in Nigeria is spotted in the video beside Cardi as he also sprays wads of dollars bills on the scantily dressed strippers. Rihanna surely knew what she was saying when she sang, ‘strip clubs and dollars bills, I still got more money’ in her song, “Pour It Up”. Watch the videos below: Since arriving in Nigeria, Cardi B has been sharing different videos of her experience in the country. From comparing the country to the Dominican Republic, asking to be taken to the ‘real Nigeria’, her craving for jollof rice, admitting to watching porn in her hotel room to gifting a female fan five free tickets to her show in Lagos later this evening. Prior to arriving in Nigeria, she had shared a video from her private jet. In the video, the rapper was seen twerking to an unreleased remix of Davido’s ‘Fall’ on which she is featured. After she arrived in Nigeria, Davido took to his Instagram page to welcome her. He shared a video of the rapper on the plane on his Instagram page, welcoming her home. He shared the video and captioned it: “Welcome home.”
