 House of Representatives leader Gajabiamila  Adopting a motion under matters of urgent importance initiated by Mrs. Tolulope Akande-Sadipe during plenary presided over by the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, the House mandated the Nigerian Diaspora Commission, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and House Committee on Diaspora Matters to investigate the matter and urgently prevent a repeat of xenophobic attacks on Nigerians in Ghana. Akande-Sadipe, who chairs the Committee on Diaspora Matters said she had reliable information on Sunday, December 1, 2019, that over 600 shops belonging to foreign traders, particularly Nigerians at the Kwame Nkrumah Circle, Ghana had been locked up by the Ghana Union of Traders Association (GUTA). She said this was not the first time such a quest to rid the Ghanaian market of foreign traders had occurred, adding that there was a case last month where Ghanaian traders at Opera Square in Accra locked up shops belonging to Nigerians. The lawmaker also cited a case in August last year where the Inter-Governmental Task Force constituted by the Ghanaian Government in its bid to regulate retail trade, arrested and detained 37 Nigerian traders and locked up about 10 shops on Tip Toe Lane at the Kwame Nkrumah Circle Ghana on the pretext that they were yet to regularise their business concerns as prescribed by law. She expressed concerned that the recent attack on Nigerian traders would become another case of xenophobia attack with loss of lives, as GUTA had decided to take laws into their hands since according to them, the government had failed to enforce the GIPC law 865 article 27 and 28, which bars foreigners from doing retail businesses in Ghana. Akande-Sadipe noted that the latest wave of attacks on Nigerians could be due to President Muhammadu Buhariâ€™s decision to close all land borders in an attempt to prevent any import or export of products through road as a way of curbing the movement of illegal goods into the country.
