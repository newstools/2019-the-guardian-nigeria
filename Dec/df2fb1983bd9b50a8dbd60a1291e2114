Enugu Rangers yesterday showed that a new coach does not actually translate to a new attitude when they lost 1-3 to Egypt’s Pyramids FC in their CAF Confederation Cup group opening game. Rangers last week sacked Coach Ben Ugwu following a run of successive defeats, including a home loss to Akwa Starlets in the Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL). They brought in national team coach, Salisu Yusuf to try to steady the ship, but against a sleek Pyramid FC, the Flying Antelopes could not lift their limbs. Playing at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium, Enugu, Ibrahim Olawoyin’s 29th-minute effort was expected to galvanise the Nigerians to a massive win. Instead, the Enugu boys contrived to send their fans home, looking for whom to blame for another loss. Rangers were reduced to 10 men when Tope Olusesi was given his marching orders on the stroke of half-time for a second caution. After that, it was an open road for Pyramids FC. The Egyptians came back to life with Mohamed Farouk drawing them level in the 54th minute from the spot. The Pharaohs twisted the dagger through Amor Layouni, who converted an assist from outstanding Islam Eissa in the 83rd minute. The damage was completed four minutes later when Eissa converted Pyramids’ second penalty after Eric Traore was fouled by goalkeeper Nana Bonsu. It is not the worst phase Enugu Rangers have gone through in recent times, but their next game is against  another Egyptian side, Al Masry on December 8 at the Alexandria Stadium, Alexandria. That is a hard ask for a team still unsure of what has been happening to it. But the coach has about seven days to get the boys up to speed for what on paper is a daunting task.
