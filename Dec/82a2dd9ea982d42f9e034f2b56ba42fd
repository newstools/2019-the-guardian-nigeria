REUTERS/Huseyin Aldemir  The Uighur Act of 2019 condemns Beijing’s “gross human rights violations” in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, where upwards of one million Uighurs and other mostly Muslim minorities are believed to be held in re-education camps. “For all wrong actions and words… the proper price must be paid,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a regular press briefing. When asked if the passing of the bill would impact on talks for a phase one trade deal between the two economic giants, Hua did not directly answer the question. But she said there was “no way this can have no effect on China-US relations as well as the two countries’ cooperation in important areas.” The foreign ministry had earlier slammed the bill, saying it “viciously attacks the Chinese government’s policy of governing Xinjiang.” Without giving any more details about what measures China would take, Hua said the “price that must be paid will come eventually.” Washington had already angered Beijing when US President Donald Trump signed legislation supporting pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, prompting Beijing earlier this week to impose sanctions on US NGOs and suspend future visits by US warships to the semi-autonomous city.
