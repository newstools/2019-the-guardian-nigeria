Riverine Communities in Degema one Cluster, comprising over 40 communities in Degema and Asari-Toru Local Government Areas, Rivers State, have called for the enhancement of communication networks in the creeks and waterways to tackle pirate attacks in the area. Degema one cluster Chairman, Mr. Bob Ogunga, said lives could be saved and pirates attacks reduced, when there is viable communication networks around the creeks and waterways.Ogunga stated this in Port Harcourt shortly after receiving over 1, 500 phones on behalf of the community from Eroton Exploration and Productions Limited, an indigenous oil firm operating in the area. He noted that pirate attacks and other hoodlums activities have been on the increase, following degradation in the communication networks between the riverine communities and the uplands, where security operatives are often stationed.He expressed the hope that the partnership between Eroton and Globacom Limited to enhance communication networks in the area would go a long way in addressing the enormous security challenges on the sea.
