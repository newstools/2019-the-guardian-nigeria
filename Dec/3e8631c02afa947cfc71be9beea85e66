Tekashi 6ix9ine Begs Judge For A Second Chance | Photo: The Blast Embattled American rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine has made an emotion laden plea to the judge ahead of his sentencing for a second chance. In a letter addressed to Judge Paul Engelmayer, Tekash writes: “As my sentencing date approaches, I am becoming more and more overwhelmed with emotions. More than anything, I am extremely grateful for this opportunity to express my remorse to you, your Honor, over this situation.” The “Fefe” rapper who has had time to go over the the recklessness of his decisions and lifestyle says, “I wake every morning asking myself, was it worth it?” He continues, “I know that my life will never be the same but hopefully this change will be for the better because beyond all of this, I still consider myself a role model to millions of people as an artist, a celebrity and as a human being. I’m happy that the public was able to witness me dealing with the consequences of my actions because I feel like it sheds a light on what can come from gang affiliation. “I now know that I am remorseful for what happened because I was blessed with the gift of an opportunity that most people dream of but I squandered it by getting involved with the wrong people and misrepresenting myself when I should have been true to myself and my fans.” Tekashi promises to dedicate a portion of his life to a good cause: helping others not make similar mistakes. “If given a second chance, I will not let this Court down and I will dedicate a portion of my life to helping others not make the same mistakes that I’ve made.” Federal prosecutors had already asked the judge for leniency, according to them Tekashi’s testimony against his former gang members have been “incredibly significant and extremely useful”. The New York rapper who is facing 47 years in prison for kidnapping and gang related crimes, testified against his former associates and fellow Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods members in hope for a lesser sentence.
