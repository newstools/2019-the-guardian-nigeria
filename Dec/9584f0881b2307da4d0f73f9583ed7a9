Although the November 14, 2019, fatal tanker accident that claimed lives and destroyed properties, at the Ota old toll gate, Sango, on the Lagos-Abeokuta highway, Ogun State, might have come and gone, the indictment of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) by the state government, remains an issue of debate.
 
Governor Dapo Abiodun, through a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin on November 17, blamed the men of the FRSC for incessant accidents around the area.
 
He was quoted thus: “Those vehicles that the FRSC usually ask to park by the roadside contribute to the gridlock and pose dangers to unsuspecting motorists. Governor Abiodun has therefore issued a ‘no parking’ directive to the corps.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
