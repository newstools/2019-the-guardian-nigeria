 President, ISPON, Dr. Yele Okeremi  Software practitioners are currently angered by the perceived neglect of the sub-sector by the Federal Government of Nigeria. Under the aegis of the Institute of Software Practitioners of Nigeria (ISPON), the operators said the development of software should be priortised by governments at all levels.
   
Speaking at a Roundtable in Lagos, themed, “Future of Software in Nigeria,” the practitioners stressed the need to implement the Presidential Executive Orders series that started in May 2017, with Numbers E01, E02; E03 and subsequently EO4, EO5, among others, to improve local content in software applications in Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) operating in the country.
   
ISPON represents indigenous software developers and practitioners in Nigeria, established in 1999, with the aim of creating an enabling environment for local content developers. Leading the charge for new direction for the sub-sector, President, ISPON, Dr. Yele Okeremi, said the roundtable was convened to unmask the miseries around the software industry in Nigeria.  How have we fared so far?
“The intent was to maximise in-country capacity and capability in all contracts and transactions with software components, utilising Nigeria human and material resources in the planning and execution of Nigerian projects.
   
“Unfortunately, some people are not interested in working in that direction. This must stop if we are going to build an enduring and endearing future for the younger generation. We must build ‘software-future’ for the younger generation, and it requires growing local by patronising indigenous software companies.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
