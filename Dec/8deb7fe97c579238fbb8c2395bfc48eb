The bears sustained dominance on the equities sector of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), yesterday, even as most blue-chip stocks depreciated in price, causing investors’ wealth to slump by N38 billion in four trading days.
   
Specifically, the market capitalisation, which stood at N13.027 trillion when the market reopened for transactions on Monday, had depreciated by N38 billion or 0.29 percent to N12.989 trillion on Thursday. Also, the All-Share Index (ASI) shed 76.89 points or 0.28 percent from 26,990.59 to 26,913.70.

The Chief Operating Officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion, noted that the stock market will sustain its decline as mixed sentiments persist amid cautious trading, despite the rates and yields’ crash across other investment windows, as well as the expected seasonal market moves this December.
