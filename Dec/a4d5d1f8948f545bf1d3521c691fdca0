South West socio-political organisation, Yoruba Ronu, has said it will only support the candidate with the desire and energy to strengthen Nigeria’s diversity in the coming 2023 presidential election. In a statement yesterday, president of the group, Mr. Akin Malaolu, said Yoruba Ronu’s position was based on a comment by President Muhammadu Buhari on his birthday that he would support only the best candidate as his successor. Malaolu said the group would also lend its support only to the candidate that was ready to continue with the policies of President Buhari, which it affirmed had brought sanity to the country. “The clamour for the presidency of Nigeria come 2023 is no longer at the back burner and the wish of several diverse groups and tribes to be given the opportunity to occupy the presidential seat is everyone’s democratic right. “But before we plunge the nation into political troubles due to foreseen competition that may likely be provoked, our leadership forum, for these reasons, met and took the following decision,” he said. According to the group, the candidate that will get its back shall be a Nigerian 100 per cent in blood and by birth. “Such must also have the desire and energy to strengthen our diversity as well as the continuation of the policies of President Buhari’s administration, which has brought sanity and respect to our humanity and must have the requisite calibre and probity to be president of the nation,” it stated. On the issue of rotational of presidency, Yoruba Ronu said, “We shall take a common stand with the political leaders of the entire South West, including Kwara and Kogi states. However, our decision on the rotation of the presidency would be in line with our wishes for Nigeria and Nigerians regardless of tribe or religion. Those who are goading us to support a particular tribe or personality should let us be until the need arises.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
