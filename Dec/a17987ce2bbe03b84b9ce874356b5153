 Dickson  The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has resolved to embark on a nationwide consultation with a view to reconciling aggrieved members and shopping for an acceptable presidential candidate ahead of the 2023 general elections.Chairman of the party’s Board of Trustees (BoT), Senator Walid Jibrin, who dropped the hint, said the board would also meet Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State and his Bayelsà counterpart, Seriake Dickson, to settle their political differences. Jibrin, who addressed a press briefing, pointed out that while on the consultation tour, the BoT members would reconcile aggrieved stalwarts to strengthen the party for the take-over of government from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2023.“PDP members will equally be sensitised to avoid use of abusive languages against one another and non-members as well as discourage suspension or dismissal of party member,” he added. The Second Republic lawmaker, however, explained that “there is nothing wrong for any member of the party to show interest in the presidential race.”He noted that it would be better for party members to agree on a consensus candidate, just as “we are working hard to make the party the stronger and unbeatable in 2023.” Though Jibrin was silent on the zone to produce the consensus candidate, he was nevertheless emphatic on the need for the party to agree on the standard-bearer before the general elections.He added: “On the presidential candidate, the National Working Committee (NWC), in consultation with all relevant organs will reveal the plan for coming up with our presidential candidate.“I don’t think there is anything wrong to allow anybody from any zone to show interest, but our collective decision will bring out an agreeable candidate. “Meanwhile, what is there in our front is for us to work hard to unite the party by making it strongest and unbeatable in the next presidential election.“The Board of Trustees is making necessary arrangement to reconcile the Governor of Rivers State, Nyeson Wike, and his Bayelsa counterpart, Seriake Dickson, and of course, other party members to make our party stronger with a view to taking over government from the ruling APC in 2023.” In a related development, Governor Wike has called on Rivers political elite to promote unity and reconciliation.Speaking against the backdrop of the bickering among this privileged class, the governor said his administration had “practically promoted reconciliation and unity after the last general elections by withdrawing murder charges preferred against some opposition politicians in the state.” He made the appeal yesterday during the 20th Ikwerre National Day of thanksgiving 2019 at the State Ecumenical Centre, Port Harcourt.
Represented by his Chief of Staff, Chukwuemeka Woke, the governor said he remained committed to promoting and advancing the unity of the state.He assured the audience that one way he would demonstrate his commitment towards advancement of unity and reconciliation in the state would be through programmes and projects.Wike urged Rivers leaders to take deliberate steps to promote the unity of the state.
