Police Found Guns And Marijuana On Juice Wrld’s Private Plane | Image: BT.com Juice Wrld reportedly died after suffering a seizure while walking through Chicago’s Midway airport on Sunday, December 8. Before Juice Wrld’s private plane arrived from Los Angeles, police officers and federal had been waiting at the Atlantic Aviation hangar at Midway early Sunday because they suspected the 21-year-old musician was in possession of contraband. As they were going through two carts of luggage, Juice Wrld — whose real name is Jarad Higgins — “began convulsing (and) going into a seizure,” police sources said. An agent administered two doses of Narcan, an emergency treatment when an opioid overdose is suspected. Higgins woke up but was incoherent, police said. Paramedics took him to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, where he was pronounced dead at 3:14 a.m., about an hour after he landed in Chicago. According to law enforcement, members of Higgins’ entourage said the ‘Lucid Dreams’ star had taken ‘several unknown pills’ moments before falling ill, TMZ reported.

The two guards with Higgins were charged with illegally possessing the guns and ammunition. Earlier in June, Higgins publicly vowed to his girlfriend Lotti on Twitter that he would finally stop taking the painkiller codeine. “Bae I’m sorry I be tweaking, you’ve put up with more than ppl know I know I be scaring you, f**k Codeine I’m done, I love you and im letting it be known publicly that ain’t s**t f***ing up the real love I found.
