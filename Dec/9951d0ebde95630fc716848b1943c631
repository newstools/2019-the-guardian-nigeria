Intense profit-taking in the equities market, which triggered selloffs since the previous week, persisted till the close of transactions last week. The development caused the All-Share Index (ASI) and market capitalisation to depreciate by 1.19 per cent to close the week at 26,536.21 points and N12.81 trillion respectively. All other indices finished lower with the exception of NSE Pension, NSE Insurance, NSE-AFR Div Yield, NSE MERI Value and NSE Oil and Gas indices, which appreciated by 0.02 per cent, 0.03 per cent, 2.09 per cent and 2.06 per cent and 0.03 per cent respectively. Analysts said the slowdown would remain mixed, even as investors take advantage of the pullback and low supply to position, ahead of the usual Santa Claus and year-end rally, as capital flow and repositioning in value stocks continue. Specifically, the Chief Research Officer of Investdata Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omodion, said: “There is also the changing sentiment in the expectation of improved liquidity and positive economic indices. “Again, the current undervalued state of the market offers investors opportunities to position for short and medium-to-long-term horizons. “We expect that investors would target fundamentally sound and dividend-paying stocks for possible capital appreciation as the year draws down to usher in 2020, “Also, traders and investors need to change their strategies owing to NSE’s pricing methodology, CBN directives and its impact on the economy in the nearest future.” Analysts at Codros Capital said: “In our view, given the risk-off sentiment dominating the domestic market, we expect the market to shed points in the coming week, except we see a policy-driven catalyst. “Nevertheless, valuations remain attractive, hence we expect pockets of gains over the final weeks of the year as fund and portfolio managers realign portfolios prior to the start of 2020.” Last week, a turnover of 1.044 billion shares worth N14.628 billion was recorded in 14,974 deals by investors on the floor of the exchange in contrast with 952.697 million shares valued at N12.774 billion that changed hands  in 17,279 deals during the previous week.
