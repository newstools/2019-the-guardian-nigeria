Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar yesterday visited the central registry of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) high court, Maitama, Abuja to sign his witness deposition (on oath) before the commissioner for oaths. His visit underscored the importance he attached to the suit he filed against Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Social Media, Loretta Onochie. Atiku was accompanied by his legal counsel, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN) and other members of his legal team. Among other claims, Atiku is demanding N2.5b from Onochie, as general, aggravated, punitive and exemplary damages. He is claiming the sum for Onocheâ€™s defamatory story published on her twitter handle and Facebook page, in which she alleged that Atiku was on the United Arab Emirate (UAE) watch list, as a wanted man, who was shopping for terrorists.
