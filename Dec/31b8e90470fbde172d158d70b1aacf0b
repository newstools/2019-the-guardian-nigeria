Beroro Efekoro will become the first Nigerian-born lawmaker in the Albany County Legislature, New York after his swearing-in as a legislator on Wednesday, January 1, 2020, in the United States. Efekoro is one of the ten incoming legislators of the 39-member body legislative chamber. The Nigerian-born lawmaker-elect defeated the incumbent Albany Democrat, Doug Bullock, in November’s general election and will represent the 7th legislative district, which encompasses the Beverwyck and Pine Hills neighbourhoods in Albany. Born in Nigeria, Efekoro moved to New York City with his father and siblings in 2008. The 29-year-old city resident moved to the city in 2012 to pursue a degree in political science at the University at Albany where he became immersed in the community and political arena. After graduating in 2015, Efekoro was selected as a committee person by Carolyn McLaughlin, who was then chairwoman of the Albany County Democratic Committee. Albany Legislator Frank Commisso Sr. said Efekoro has been volunteering for quite some time. In 2017, he ran unsuccessfully for the Common Council’s 11th ward seat against incumbent Judd Krasher and Democratic challengers Alfredo Balarin and Clifton Dixon. Balarin ultimately won the election. Efekoro now serves as deputy ward leader for the 11th ward. Efekoro said he will focus on addressing vacant buildings, securing housing for veterans, and establishing more programs and resources for youth, family and seniors. The Nigerian-born lawmaker-elect said soliciting scholarship fund for high school graduates living in the Pine Hills and Beverwyck neighbourhoods will be part of his agenda on education.
