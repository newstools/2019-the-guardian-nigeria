The Federal Government has reiterated commitment to sustaining the fight against corruption in line with the provisions of the constitution.
 
The commitment was made during the 2019 International Anti-Corruption Day jointly organized by the European Union (EU), British Council, the Rule of Law and Anti-Corruption (RoLAC) and MacArthur Foundation.
 
At the forum were the Country Representative, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Oliver Stople; the National Programme Manager, Rule of Law and Anti- Corruption (RoLAC), Danladi Plang; Anti-Corruption Component Manager, Emmanuel Uche; representative of Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), Dr. Orji Ogbonnaya Orji as well as representatives of various anti-graft agencies.  She disclosed two major approaches to fighting corruption, which according to her, include ‘Strategic and Beneficial Ownership of Assets’ which the anti-corruption agencies focused on at the event.
 
The Country Representative, UNODC, Stople, in his remarks, commended the efforts recorded in the fight against corruption and called for more work.
 
Noting that trillions of dollars were taken away from the country by Nigerians, he advocated extra efforts in combating trafficking in persons and money laundering.
 
Stople regretted the rate at which corruption has threatened Nigeria’s corporate existence, stressing that it “must be fought.”
   
He was however delighted that people and groups were beginning to demand accountability from the leaders
Representatives of RoLAC explained the processes jointly taken by the EU and the British Council with the cooperation of the Federal Government to establish NACS and urged that a speedy implementation through the Monitoring and Evaluation committee be fast-tracked.
