Minister of State, Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Dr. Ramatu Aliyu, has assured that the Federal Government will complete the N19.4 billion Karshi water project in Abuja Municipal area Council (AMAC) before the end of the administration’s second tenure of office. The project, awarded on July 19, 2013 to SCC Nigeria Limited by the Satellite Town Development Department (STDD) of the FCT and which reportedly stands at 45 per cent completion, is expected to supply water to residents of Karshi Satellite Town and environs. The terms of the contract also covers the construction of Karshi Dam Reservoir area of 64.1Ha, 6,000m3 clear water tank and treatment plant expected to draw water from rainfall. Aliyu, while inspecting the project during a familiarisation tour of AMAC, expressed satisfaction with the level of work done so far, stressing that when completed, the project would ameliorate water scarcity, as well as generate employment and increase economic activities such as farming in the FCT. The minister disclosed that the FCT administration had made provision in the 2019 and 2020 budget to avoid undue delay in the project.She explained that the inspection visit was to ascertain that the work being done on site was consistent with articles of the Variation Certificate submitted by the company. Earlier, the STDD director, Felix Nwankwo, had promised the minister that the contractor would be monitored strictly to ensure speedy completion of the project. Nwankwo, however, solicited prompt payment to avoid unnecessary delay. Meanwhile, the minister promised that the All Progressives Congress (APC) would not leave any stone unturned to make Abuja better for all.She made the pledge when her entourage was received at AMAC secretariat in continuation of her tour. Responding, the chairman of AMAC, Abdullahi Candido, appealed to the minister that the area council needed FCT’s support to provide more social amenities for the people and create jobs.Nwankwo also said the dam, when completed, would have a capacity of eight million cubic metres. He added that the dam would end the incessant flooding being experienced in the Karshi area, as the water that usually spilled into the community would be contained within the dam.Chief cngineer of SCC, Steven Ellas, reiterated that paucity of fund had been the main challenge facing the completion of the project.
