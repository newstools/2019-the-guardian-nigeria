Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ibrahim Pantami, has urged telecommunications companies and stakeholders to engage him constructively, warning that no amount of propaganda could intimidate him from reengineering the sector. Speaking at a reception organised in his honour by the Association of Telecommunications Company of Nigeria (ATCON) in Abuja, Pantami stated that his goal was to make a positive impact in the nation’s ICT sector of the economy by tackling the various challenges militating against its development. The minister who restated that he “is committed to ensuring that the rights of Nigerians are protected”, called on the relevant stakeholders to partner with him in taking the industry to enviable heights, insisting that propaganda could only push him to do more. ‘’The responsibility of taking the sector to further heights does not lie on one person but on all of us. We need to get in touch when necessary. I appreciate constructive criticism but not propaganda, I am not intimidated, I can’t be intimidated by propaganda. It can’t get into me. Propaganda pushes me to do more. I encourage us to join hands to take the industry to a higher level. I will never lock my doors against you,’’ he pledged. Pantami noted that he had already tabled the numerous challenges confronting operators to the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and the National Security Adviser (NSA), adding that he had gotten their cooperation. He assured stakeholders that his administration would leave no stone unturned in ensuring that the problems confronting them were effectively addressed.
The minister thanked ATCON for the recognition, proposing a periodic meeting between him, heads of agencies and stakeholders to address the challenges headlong. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
