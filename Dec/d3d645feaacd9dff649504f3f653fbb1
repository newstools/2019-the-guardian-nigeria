The invasion of the Federal High Court, Abuja, by agents of the Department of State Services (DSS) to re-arrest the Publisher of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore, and his co-defendant, Olawale Bakare has been described as a brazen act, carried out to frustrate court rulings and to violate Nigerians. Publisher, Africa Oil+Gas Report, Toyin Akinosho, who stated this in a statement made available to The Guardian, yesterday, said the action of the DSS made extreme mockery of Nigerians queuing up every four years to vote at national elections. He said:  “If this is what we get as the interpretation of security agents to the body language of a former general sitting on the highest seat in the land, then we have not elected a gentleman. “And none of the things we may consider an act of good governance, whether they be safe spaces for kids going to school, quality healthcare for our families, easier ways of doing business, clearing the ports in an orderly manner, means what we generally assume they mean. We should all react in horror to acts like this. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
