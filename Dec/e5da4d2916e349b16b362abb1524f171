Imo State Police Command, yesterday, arrested a popular Nigeria music artiste, Okechukwu Wane, popularly call Duncan Mighty, on allegation of fraud. The statement by the command’s Public Relations Officer, Orlando Ikeokwu, said the arrest followed a breach of contract by the musician, which runs into millions of naira. The statement partly reads: “This followed a petition written by an upcoming rap artiste, M2, who claimed that Imo State Government, led by Owelle Rochas Okorocha, through the office of the Special Adviser on Entertainment, entered into a deal with Duncan Mighty to manage, promote, arrange collaboration with other top artistes. An agreement was reached with a fee of N11m paid to Duncan Mighty, but after collecting the payment, he refused to fulfill his own part of the deal. “Sequel to the petition, the artiste was arrested, and he affirmed having such agreement and collecting the fund, but said he can only refund the money if the contract is terminated. He was then released on bail on self-recognisance.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
