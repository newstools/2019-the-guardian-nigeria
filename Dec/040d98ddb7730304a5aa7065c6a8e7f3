To build Human Resource (HR) competencies, the need to identify and articulate leadership skills to manage disruptive changes for organisational transformation has been underscored. Indeed, for HR practitioners to remain relevant in the future, and help achieve their organisational goals, the need to be competent, curious and courageous is pertinent.
   
At the 51st Annual National Conference of the Chartered Institute  of Personnel Management of Nigeria (CIPM), recently in Abuja, themed, “Disruption: Change the Game”, a HR specialist, Akpos Adonkie, who spoke on, “Building Strong HR Skills, Competencies for Today and the Future,” used Ulrich’s Four Role Model to illustrate his points on the role of HR in the 21st Century.
   
According to him, ability to operate strategically, capability to facilitate change, ability to use an evidence based management (Data Analytics), ability to make value added contributions, be persuasive and be able to deliver services efficiently and effectively are the requirements of an effective HR Practitioner.  He urged employers of labour to ensure that adequate safety is provided at workplaces, the general welfare of employees should be attended to, and all laws regulating labour practices should be obeyed to ensure cordial relationship between the employers and their employees.Earlier, President/Chairman of Governing Council (CIPM), Wale Adediran, said the yearly conference was an avenue to explore and proffer solutions to the most contemporary issues in the workplace.
