For residents of Bucknor, Jakande Gate, Isheri Osun, Ijegun, Ikotun, Igando, Ijegemo, Ijedodo and environs in Lagos State, a relief from the intractable traffic on the Jakande Gate/Isolo route came on stream with the commissioning of De Prinocc link bridge at Oke Ogbere from the Oke-Afa canal waterside in Ejigbo to Community Road in Ago Palace Way, Okota. The commissioning coincided with the maiden weeklong celebration of Oke-Ogbere Community Day, which the Baale, High Chief Tajudeen Amoo Orilowo, said would reunite indigenes and mobilise residents to promote the link bridge. Ogbere shares border with Isolo, Amuwo-Odofin, Ejigbo, Egbe and Isheri Olofin. Residents of Community Road are however appealing to the government to repair the wide unpaved road that stretched for several kilometres off Ago Palace Way with the anticipated influx of road users. The Community Road was constructed by residents about 12 years ago. “We want government to come and tar the road for us – this is a state road to complement the link bridge. Motorists, including motorcycles, tricycles and cars, pay amounts ranging from N100 and above for each trip across the bridge while pedestrians pay N50. This is the price we have to pay for government neglect and privilege of easy, convenient movement in and out of the area,” Mr. Yusuf Afolabi, said. Commissioning the bridge, the former Minister of State for Defence, Senator Musiliu Obanikoro, commended the initiator of the project, Prince Yommy Ogungbe, MD/CEO, De-Prinocc Construction Company, for the foresight to provide the infrastructure at a modest cost though the accompanying convenience cannot be priced. “I hope the community will ensure that the investment is protected and the state government in good time will come around to provide more amenities for the people of these communities to make life easier for citizens. This is an initiative that should be encouraged and replicated across other communities in the state where development is lacking,” he said. This is the latest addition to other link bridges constructed by the firm, which includes the one linking Ajegunle/Boundary Market to Apapa and a footbridge linking Ago-Okota to Ijesha on the Oshodi-Apapa Expressway. Ogungbe said he is devoted to linking up communities where access is barely existent to turn the rural areas into urban centres.
