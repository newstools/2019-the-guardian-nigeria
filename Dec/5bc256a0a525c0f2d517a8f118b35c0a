Faduyile Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) has said that brain drain will continue in the health sector, if governments fail to provide conducive working environment in the health sector. The president, Dr. Francis Faduyile, disclosed this during a medical outreach at Gwarzo Council of Kano State, as part of activities scheduled for the National Executive Council Meeting of NMA in the state. Dr. Faduyile, who lamented persistent system collapse and dilapidated infrastructure in the public health facilities, reminded that doctors should not be held responsible for the mass exodus in the country. The NMA president, who disclosed that the doctor/patient ration in Nigeria was 1:20,000, said the country was very far from the World Health Organisation (WHO) standard one doctor to 600 patients. “Let me affirm that our members are leaving the country for greener pasture for reasons not far-fetched. First, government needs to improve the health of Nigerians and this is part of issues slated for discussion at the general meeting. “We have always asked government to make opening for employment of doctors and we shall continue the advocacy. I want to believe that if we have enough openings, many of our doctors travelling abroad will reduce. “There are other predicaments that militate against the stay of medical doctors and other health workers in this country. They include working environment, equipment and staffing. If government can ensure that these facilities are available, doctors will stay back home,” Faduyile emphasised. On medical tourism, the NMA boss urged government to initiate policies to improve the healthcare system. Kano NMA chairman, Dr. Sanusi Bala, explained that about 5,000 patients were targeted to benefit from the medical mission that would cover eye surgery, dental and ear examination, among others.
