Catholic Archbishop of Onitsha Archdiocese in Anambra State, Valerian Okeke, has urged Nigerians, especially Christians to make the world a better place and be a source of ‘joy to the world.’ Okeke, who is also Metropolitan of Onitsha Ecclesiastical Province, stated this in his Christmas message at the Basilica of the Most Holy Trinity. His words: “I invite all men and women of goodwill to make this Christmas a season of joy to your neighbourhood, be joy to the world, be the joy people yearn for. Be the part of peace which people are yearning for, but unwilling to give. “Be great, not by being served, but by serving others. Be a servant to those around you and that makes you truly great. That is what Jesus Christ did and gave joy to the world.” Also, representative of Lagos Central Senatorial District, Oluremi Tinubu felicitated with all the country. She said, “The season calls for sober reflection on the purpose of the birth of Jesus. In reflecting, we must not lose sight of the difficult journey that the time preceding His birth must have been for Mary. “I implore us all to continue to be communal, looking out for one another and lending a helping hand to those around us who may be in need in order to create a better world.” Meanwhile, District Superintendent of West and Central Africa, Apostolic Faith Church, Rev. Bayo Adeniran has charged government at all levels to always formulate policies that will improve the livelihoods of Nigerians. He stressed that such humane policies should also be well guided so that they do not become counter-productive. But Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina said the Federal Government actually respects the rule of law, insisting that only when certain aspects of national life conflict with national security, the latter must take preeminence.
