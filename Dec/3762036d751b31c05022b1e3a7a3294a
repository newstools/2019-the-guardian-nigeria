Two private schools in Ondo State, Mummy’s Place International Nursery and Primary School and Emplace College, Akure, have emerged the Most Ethically Responsible College in the state. Also, 100 staffers of these schools would be trained in ethics. The award of excellence was conferred on the schools at the weekend by a Kogi State-based international anti-corruption non-governmental organisation (NGO): Centre for Ethics and Self-value Orientation, which specialises in conducting independent, secret investigation and assessment. The NGO’s Executive Director, Mr. Musa Yakubu Saleh, disclosed that the award was based on the quality of the curriculum, infrastructure, time-management resources, SERVICOM, staff welfare, output among others. He said: “In measuring the performances of schools, we looked at the quality of education provided and subjected students to emotional intelligence. We came out with valid results.” He revealed the organisation spent 14 days in the state to embark on multi-sectoral investigations in collaboration with government agencies, stakeholders and other NGOs, while affirming that “this award has no price-tag. ” “The award is a certificate of credence, having scored 72 per cent cumulatively in our assessment criteria to fall within the gold medalist schools in the country. “There are 100 of them, and in Ondo State, there are only six of them. They are private schools. We are returning to train 100 of their workers, taking 70 per cent of the liability of the training off the schools…” The Proprietress, Dr. (Mrs.) Damilola Oshin said the culture of the schools thrived on hard-work, academic, moral and spiritual excellence. Oshin was also honoured by the centre as an Ambassador of Ethics and a Woman of Conscience for the feat in the sector and place the staff on the same salary scale with public school teachers.
