Off her most recent album “Lucid,”  the Queen of soul Asa is out with the official video for her single “Murder in the USA”. “Who’s gonna save me now, I shot my lover and I ran away” The lyrics talk about love that turned sour. Its video shows two lovebirds starting off on good terms with lots of love but when infidelity and violence creep in, it ended up with one lover dead. Murder In The USA was directed by Sesan and Asa.
