Fourteen teams are set to take part in this year’s second edition of the “Leg Lagos Challenge Season Two” slated for the Agege Stadium, Lagos from tomorrow to December 8. The competition, a four-day scouting event, will afford the players the opportunity to showcase their talents before six FIFA licensed scouts from U.S., Cameroun, Europe and Nigeria, who will monitor and select the best for clubs in Europe.The competition organised by Don Balon Commerz and chaired by Abdul Baki Ladi Balogun, will also hold in Abuja after the Lagos edition to spread the reach for talents in the country. Balogun said the scouts would be strict this year, adding that the organisers would look for players that could last for 10 years during the competition. “The second edition of Leg Lagos Challenge is aimed at seeing players who would be in Europe for 10 years to come.“We will have the Abuja edition immediately after the Lagos edition. I wish all the teams and players best of luck. “I want to appeal to everyone that the way we choose players won’t be the same this year because the scout coming will be very strict in looking for the best in players,” he said, adding that bringing in players that are U23 will guarantee their longevity in the sport for 10 years.The Tournament Director, Pius Kayode Olubode, advised team managers to abide by the rules, adding that they should present the birth certificates, National ID cards, current school results of the  players registered for the competition.
