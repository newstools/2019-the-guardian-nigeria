Analysts at Codros Capital Limited said: “We expect trading volumes to start to temper in the NTB market, as the average yield trends towards the single-digit level. “However, the average OMO yield is expected to remain around the same level, moderately paring in the coming week. Overall, we expect overall volumes in the market to pare and market participants to take positions in Treasury bonds as has been witnessed over the past few weeks.” Vetiva Capital Limited also said: “Going into the new week, we anticipate weaker performance in the local bourse as investors are expected to take profit.” The Chief Research Officer of lnvestdata Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omodion, added: “Going forward, there is a possibility that lagging sectors could offer the best investment opportunities yet for year-end positioning and beyond.
