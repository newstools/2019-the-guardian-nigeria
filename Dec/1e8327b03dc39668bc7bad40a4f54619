Getting a good night’s rest can be such a task sometimes but, luckily there are ways in which you can avoid sleepless nights. One of such ways is improving your diet, if you haven’t already. And this can also reflect in as little as what you drink. Warm milk, chamomile tea and cherry juice are all beverages that are believed to be effective sleeping aids for restless sleepers. So if you’re having trouble sleeping, chances are you’ll try almost anything to get that good night’s rest. But have you tried any of these beverages? Milk Even though this option is common, it still has many divided. Some say drinking milk – especially warm milk – can help promote sleep, while others say there is no evidence that it does. However, it is important to note that milk contains another hormone called melatonin which is also related to sleep and relaxation, The Guardian reports and Dairy milk contains tryptophan, which is an amino acid used to manufacture a neurotransmitter melatonin. Chamomile Tea According to a dietitian Nicole Osinga, Chamomile is a mild tranquilizer and sleep-inducer and a warm beverage can be very calming which makes this tea appropriate. According to a 2010 study by Case Western Reserve University, the sedative effects may be due to the presence of the flavonoid apigenin, a bioactive constituent of chamomile. Banana Shakes Bananas are an excellent source of magnesium and potassium and also contain tryptophan (a mentioned above). All you need to do is simply combine your favourite milk with a banana and some cinnamon in a blender and you are good to go. Also, other foods and fruits containing magnesium are potent enough to relax your nerves while inducing sleep.
