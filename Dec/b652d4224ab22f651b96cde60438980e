• Local Council Workers Assured Of A Robust Yuletide Delta State Governor, Senator Ifeanyi has said siting a National Industrial Court in the state would speed up justice delivery in labour-related issues. He said siting the court in Asaba would also contribute to the development of the state. The governor, who said this, when the President of National Industrial Court of Nigeria (NICN), Justice Benedict Kanyip, visited him in Asaba, announced that the Court of Appeal would commence full session in the state in 2020. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Olisa Ifeajika, Okowa said: “We believe that something good will always come to our state. We are positive-thinking people. We have roles to play in our nation. We are glad that you have come to see what is going on here and have seen the need to site an Industrial Court. We are confident that this visit will turn things around in our state. “We will continue to do our best to see that our people get justice. The Court of Appeal will take off in the early part of next year. The travel time for court sitting in other states cause a lot of pains to our people and as a state, we believe we have enough cases for us to have the court.” Justice Kanyip said he was in the state to see facilities on ground and partner the government to deliver “on our core mandate of delivering justice and see how we can establish functional division here.” Meanwhile, the governor, at the weekend, inaugurated 60 buses for Delta Transports Services Limited (Delta Line) with a charge to the company to turn around its fortunes through improved services. Also, workers in the Delta State Unified Local Government Service Commission will receive their December salaries before Christmas.
