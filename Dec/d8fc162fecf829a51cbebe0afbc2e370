 Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson greets newly-elected Conservative MPs in the Palace of Westminster, central London on December 16, 2019. – Prime Minister Boris Johnson got down to work Monday following his sweeping election victory, appointing ministers and announcing plans to publish legislation this week to get Britain out of the European Union.

European leaders have said the December 2020 deadline would be too tight to complete a comprehensive deal and the main opposition Labour party says Johnson’s proposal could lead to a no-deal outcome. “Last week the public voted for a government that would get Brexit done and move this country forward — and that’s exactly what we intend to do, starting this week,” a Downing Street source said. “Our manifesto made clear that we will not extend the implementation period and the new Withdrawal Agreement Bill will legally prohibit government agreeing to any extension.” The House of Commons returns on Tuesday to elect a speaker and begin swearing in MPs. The state opening of parliament will take place on Thursday when Queen Elizabeth II will read out the government’s legislative programme. The Withdrawal Agreement Bill is due to be brought before MPs on Friday. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
