In line with its dedication to leverage technology as a means of changing how clients access and consume financial services, Asset & Resource Management Holding Company Limited (ARM) is making an equity (investment) in Trove Technologies Ltd (Trove), a micro-investing application that allows users to invest in financial securities in the Nigerian and international markets. It would be recalled that in May 2019, ARM had partnered with Ventures Platform to launch Labs by ARM, which focused on supporting start-ups utilising technology, applications, and services to solve specific problems. Trove emerged as one of the six participants in the programme. In addition to Nigerians having access to the NYSE and NASDAQ, which have a market cap of $30.2t and $10.1t respectively, (making them the most valuable markets, which have also consistently outperformed every other market), through the use of Trove app, ARM will offer clients the opportunity of trading in government bonds, stocks, U.S. Exchange Traded Funds, and Stocks of U.S. companies, while its clients with the ARM Stocktrade app are also able to seamlessly participate in the global economy and own shares in valuable companies such as Facebook, Lyft, Pinterest and Zoom etc., without residing in the US, or having social security numbers. Speaking about the partnership, Managing Director of ARM Financial Advisers Limited, Mrs. Henrietta Bankole-Olusina said “We believe that this is a wonderful opportunity to enlarge the investment playing field for our valuable clients enabling them to trade in diverse stocks and accumulate wealth globally from the comfort of their homes. It is also our hope that this partnership will encourage more millennials to explore the world of investing in order to build a future of realised ambitions.” The ARM Stocktrade app can be downloaded at the tap of a button on Google Playstore or iOS store.
