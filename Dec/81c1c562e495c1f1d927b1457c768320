The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the Civilian JTF have reintegrated 464 children after separating them from armed groups in North East. According to agency, the “separation is part of an action plan to end recruitment and use of children by Boko Haram insurgents.” The exercise was consequent upon an accord struck between the two organisations. UNICEF’s chief of Borno field office, Geoffrey Ijumba, yesterday in Maiduguri said the “ceremony serves to remind all of the obligations towards children affected by the decade-long armed conflict in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states.” He said, “with the separation of these children, it brings to 2,191 the number of kids separated in the last two years.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
