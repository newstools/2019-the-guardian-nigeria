McKeon who was known for playing the son of Linda Lavin’s titular character in the classic CBS sitcom “Alice,” died Tuesday morning in Texas following a longtime illness, family spokesman Jeff Ballard confirmed to Variety. “We are all beyond heartbroken and devastated over Phil’s passing,” said Ballard. “His wonderful sense of humor, kindness and loyalty will be remembered by all who crossed his path in life.” McKeon played the role of Tommy Hyatt on “Alice” from 1976 to 1985. Following that, he appeared in several other TV shows including the NBC crime drama “CHiPs,” and a pair of ABC series, “Fantasy Island” and “The Love Boat,” in 1984. On the film side, McKeon appeared mostly in horror pics, among them “Return to Horror High” and “Ghoulies 4.” His most recent credit was as a co-producer on the 2005 psychological thriller feature “The Jacket,” which starred Adrien Brody and Keira Knightley, and boasted George Clooney, Peter Guber and Steven Soderbergh among its producers. Reacting to the news, Charlie Sheen paid a tribute to McKeon via his Twitter page calling him “a perfect gentleman” along with a black-and-white photo of himself with McKeon from “No Day at the Beach” — the episode of the 1980s NBC anthology series Amazing Stories that they starred in together. “Shared some wonderful moments in the ‘trenches’ with Phil McKeon many moons ago. Over the past few decades, he was always a perfect gentleman and an ebullient spirit. And his goofy af smile, was pure gold. r.i.p. young man. Much much too soon, you cut out.” McKeon had spent the last several years hosting his own radio show in Wimberly, Texas where he moved to be closer to his family. He previously spent a decade working in the news department at KFWB News 98 in Los Angeles. He is survived by his mother Barbara and his sister, actress Nancy McKeon.
