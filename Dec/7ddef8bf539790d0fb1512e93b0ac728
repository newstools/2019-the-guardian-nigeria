The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) president, Amaju Pinnick has disclosed that the federation is working round the clock to employ a quality coach for the senior national women team (Super Falcons) early next year. Speaking at the finals of the Oshoala Football Championship For Girls, which ended at the Campos Mini Stadium, Lagos yesterday, Pinnick, who expressed concern over the performance of the Super Falcons in recent times, said the federation was not in any way neglecting the women national teams at any level. He also boasted that the body was on course to take Nigerian football to an enviable height in 2020. While congratulating Asisat Oshoala for the large turn out of girls at the championship, Pinnick said the competition would help attract more girls to football in Nigeria. “The NFF has been having series of meetings to discuss the way forward for our national teams,” he said. “Top on the agenda is getting a new coach for the Super Falcons. With this on the pipeline, I can assure you that a credible coach will be appointed to the Super Falcons soon. The NFF is planning big for the female national team. “On the Oshoala Football Championship, I must commend Oshoala for bringing up this beautiful idea to encourage the girl/child to play football. “When she called me to attend the finals, I could not resist… out of my busy schedule I ensured that I attended the event. “Playing a celebrity game alongside Super Eagles players like Odion Ighalo, Victor Osimhen, Omeruo, Awaziem and Asisat gives me joy. “As the Oshoala Football Championship progresses, I believe it will attract more teams to participate in the female league. The NFF will not relent in supporting the development of Nigerian football in any capacity,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
