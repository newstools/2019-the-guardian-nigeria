Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong has commended efforts of security agencies to rid the state of criminal elements and ensure peaceful co-existence among the citizens. He gave the commendation when he paid a “Christmas Thank You Visit” to the Commander of Operation Safe Haven (OPSH), Major General Augustine Agundu, yesterday. Represented by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Prof. Danladi Atu, the governor informed the Commander that the visit was also to appreciate him and his men for the prompt action taken to avert an unfortunate incident that would have led to several deaths around Fillin Ball, Nasarawa area in Jos North council.
    
An eyewitness told The Guardian that two groups in the area engaged in some bloody clash, but could not be controlled by the civilian vigilante, adding that as the situation was getting out of hand, the attention of the Special Force (SF) military men attached to the OPSH, was drawn and they intervened.
  
Lalong also commended Agundu for his prompt actions to sensitive matters, which helps the peace process in the state.
  
While responding, General Agundu appreciated the governor for the visit, he said the visit would spur them to do more. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
