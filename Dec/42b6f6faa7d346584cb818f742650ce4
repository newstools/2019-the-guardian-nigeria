Speaking at Friday’s press conference ahead of the weekend clash with Arsenal, Guardiola said: “No, it is not true. I spoke a few weeks ago about my intentions with the club.” Speculation about Guardiola’s future has surfaced with the defending Premier League champions trailing leaders Liverpool by 14 points. Despite the points gap, the City manager reiterated that he would not be recruiting during the January transfer window. “The players we started the season with we are going to finish with,” he said. “We will look in the summer.” He revealed that Sergio Aguero and John Stones were unlikely to feature at the Emirates on Sunday because of injury, with David Silva also doubtful. He added: “(Stones) has a muscular injury, I don’t know how long. (Aguero) still hasn’t trained with the team.” “(Silva) couldn’t train yesterday or today but tomorrow we will see. It was a kick in the leg that was painful.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
