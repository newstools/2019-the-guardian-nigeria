 Nigerian Communications Commission  The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has said that malevolent use of modem technologies is taking its toll on the Nigerian telecoms industry, as some subscribers have reportedly lost huge sums of money to telecom-related financial crimes since the emergent use of Smartphone technology in the country.
  
NCC identified illegal SIM swaps, Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) and e-payment frauds, as the most serious cyber threats in the telecom industry in the country today.
  
Executive Commissioner, Stakeholder Management, Adeleke Adewolu who stated this at the 4th quarter 2019 Industry Consumer Advisory Forum in Abuja, noted that fraudsters conduct illegal SIM swaps of targeted individuals and then, conduct USSD-based transactions which cost the unlucky victims huge losses. He observed that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) rates e-fraud as the biggest risk in the financial sector which has widely incorporated electronic payment solutions such as Automated Teller Machines (ATMS), Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBBS) Instant Payments and Mobile Banking.
