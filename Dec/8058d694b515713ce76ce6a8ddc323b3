Cristiano Ronaldo was confronted by two pitch invaders, including one seeking a selfie, after Juventus defeated Bayer Leverkusen 2-0 in the Champions League on Wednesday. Firstly, the Portuguese star was confronted by a supporter who wanted to embrace and congratulate him on his goal-scoring performance. Just moments later, a second supporter, dressed all in black, sprinted across the BayArena pitch to snap a selfie. An angry Ronaldo pushed the fan away before security staff intervened. Ronaldo scored his second Champions League goal of the season for Juve who were already sure of the top spot in Group D and a spot in the last 16. Substitute Paulo Dybala was the creator of the 75th-minute opener, crossing low for Ronaldo to tap in a record-extending 128th goal in the competition, before Gonzalo Higuainâ€™s injury-time clincher for the Italian giants.
