The Umogun Descendants Union (UDU) has begun engaging all the ethnic nationalities on the need for the political class to respect the mutually accepted rotational governorship among the three senatorial districts in Delta State. The Urhobo group expressed concern that though the pendulum should naturally swing to Delta Central come 2023, it, however, pointed out that some political actors from the south senatorial district were allegedly working to truncate the gentleman agreement. In a statement, the body’s publicity secretary, Patrick Ighomrore, expressed their readiness to take on the gauntlet, adding that their quest for equity should not be misconstrued to mean they do not have the required numbers to produce the next governor of the state. The statement read in part:  “The 2023 governorship race is three years away, yet there are already tussles from within and outside the Urhobo nation, which are against the rotation deal for the number one position in the state.” The group noted: “Although the Urhobo nation falls mainly within Delta Central senatorial district that is also composed of three distinct federal constituencies, the argument for equity and fairness applies in the same measure in the choice of which federal constituency within the central senatorial district that should produce the governorship candidate in 2023. “The homogeneity of the Urhobo nation will not be questioned and cannot be questioned. However, the nuances that are inherent in Urhobo nation must be recognised and strengthened.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
