One of the iconic figures from the era of military administration and government in Nigeria, Brigadier-General Mobolaji Olufunso Johnson died on October 30, 2019 after 83 long years on earth. Although he served as military governor of Lagos in an era when the military officers posted to states saw the territory as their fiefdom, it is on record that he was one of only two former governors who were found not guilty on corruption charges. 
 
Last week, as tributes were paid to this gentleman as part of his funeral ceremonies, everyone acknowledged his mien as a man of peace and honour. Most living officers from the first generation of the Nigeria Army officers including former Heads of State and President were in attendance to celebrate a colleague’s good life. Characters who hold high office and yet keep their fingers off the communal till are rare in these days of extreme vanity and rapaciousness!   
 
Born on the 9th of February 1936 to Joshua Motola Johnson and Gbemisola Johnson of Egba ancestry who migrated to and settled in Lagos early in the 20th century, the young Johnson started his education at Reagan Memorial Baptist School in 1941. In 1954 he attended Hussey College in Warri before moving to Methodist Boys’ High School Lagos where he finished his secondary school education in 1957. After his secondary education he elected to join the army and in 1959 he proceeded to Officer Cadet Training School in Ghana. He continued his military training in Mons Officer Cadet School in Aldershot and finally at the iconic Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the United Kingdom from 1960 to 1961.
