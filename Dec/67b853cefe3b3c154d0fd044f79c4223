Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi has disclosed that arrangements are on top gear to attract $100 million from development partners to fund critical infrastructure. Dr. Fayemi said some development partners had visited the state to see how best they could collaborate with his administration in the areas of investment and economic empowerment for the people. He disclosed this while rendering account of his stewardship and receiving feedback with chairmen and secretaries of community development associations (CDAs) and town unions in his hometown, Isan Ekiti. Represented by his deputy, Bisi Egbeyemi, the governor said his administration had injected some valuable inputs into the system to make Ekiti marketable to local and foreign investors. Fayemi disclosed that from the beginning of next year, the state would witness massive construction of rural roads to boost agriculture and rural development, one of the five pillars of his administration. He told the elated representatives of communities that 1,000km of rural roads would either be reconstructed or rehabilitated, while dredging of waterways for erosion control was ongoing. The 2020 fiscal year, the governor added, would witness renovation of all public schools to engender more conducive teaching and learning environment for pupils and teachers, as grants were recently approved for the schools. Restating the commitment of his administration towards providing enabling environment for socio-economic development, Fayemi appealed to community leaders to always release land to prospective investors for either industrial or agricultural purposes.
