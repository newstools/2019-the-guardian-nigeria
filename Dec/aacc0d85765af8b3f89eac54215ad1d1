The Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) on Tuesday denied restricting commercial vehicles from picking and dropping off passengers at airports across the country. “The message did not originate from FAAN,” FAAN said in a tweet. “Uber and taxify are free to drop passengers at our airports.” FAAN’s tweet was in reaction to a signpost erected in front of an unspecified airport, claiming commercial vehicles have been barred from airports nationwide. The signpost photographed in the airport said defaulters of the supposed restriction by FAAN will pay N10,000 for erring the directive. The alleged restriction drew knocks from Nigerians before FAAN’s denial of the billboard. “So FAAN has issued a directive via this billboard to state that Uber Nigeria (and) Bolt amongst others are not allowed to pick up passengers from the airport,” @oneusualsuspect tweeted. FAAN, however, said the signpost has been removed and promised to address the issue.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
