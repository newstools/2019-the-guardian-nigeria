Plateau United’s Coach, Abdu Maikaba, is confident in the ability of his team to get another away victory when they meet Heartland in one of today’s Nigeria Football Professional League (NPFL) fixtures. NPFL Week Seven fixtures hold today across the country with games in all the centres except Enugu and Aba because Rangers and Enyimba are involved in continental matches. At the Okigwe Township Stadium, the Nazi Millionaires, who have five points from a win, two draws and three losses in six matches, and are 17th on the log, host the league leaders, Plateau United, who after six games have 14 points. They have won four matches and drawn two. Speaking to The Guardian yesterday, Coach Maikaba, who stated that his players were on a mission to make up for the two points they lost against Kano Pillars last week in Jos, said he looked forward to maintaining his team’s position on the NPFL’s table. “Winning this game will be like any other away match we have won. All we have to do is take the matches one after the other. For tomorrow, it is Heartland and we have our game plan to go and get something from it. “I know as we are planning, Heartland are also planning, but if we get our strategy right, I believe we will come out victories with the three points. “My boys are in high spirit to play this game and we are already in Okigwe awaiting tomorrow,” he said, adding that his team has impressed him a lot at the start of the new season. “The way the team started this season I must confess I have been impressed even as a coach and I believe if we can play the way we played in other games, we have a high chance of coming out with a very good result. “The fans definitely should expect another away win from us and I believe that will help us consolidate our top position on the log and also boost our confidence,” he stated.
