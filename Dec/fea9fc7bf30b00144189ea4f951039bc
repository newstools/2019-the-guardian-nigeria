The rapper’s attorney, Bradford Cohen, has said Kodak is giving thousands of dollars out this Christmas to both charities, religious institutions, and individual families. He has authorised his camp to buy an allotment of toys for the Paradise Day Care Center in Broward County, Florida, which will be dished out to kids from 70 different families in need. The ages of these kids range from 2-7 years old. Also, Cohen says Kodak will be donating cash and gifts to one specific family he heard about through the LightHouse for the Blind organisation in Florida who has a child that’s blind. For them, Kodak is buying braille gifts, voice-activated games, iPads, and bedding which includes plus mattresses. Kodak has also signed off on a $1,000 donation to Rabbi Kaplan of the Downtown Jewish Center Chabad in Fort Lauderdale, which will go toward building a new synagogue. For now, Kodak has spent upwards of $8,000 so far on gifts and donations. This will not be the first time the rapper will be giving back to the society. On October 1, 2018, Kodak Black donated $10,000 to the Jack and Jill Children’s center, which is a provider of early children’s education. In November 2018, Kodak Black announced that he was building a school in Haiti. On December 20, 2018, Kodak Black donated enough money to Paradise Childcare in Broward County, Florida, to provide gifts for 150 kids in the area. In addition, he also donated $5,000 for the organization’s annual Christmas party. In late 2018 he donated $2,500 to South Carolina police officer Terrence Carraway, who was killed in a shootout on duty. On May 3, 2019, Kodak Black donated $12,500 to a girl named Paige Cook, the girl’s goal was to give pencils and notebooks to give to all 7,600 students in the Cleburne Independent School District in Texas, a low-income district. In 2019, Paige raised enough money to buy over 40,000 pencils. In the wake of the 2019 Colorado STEM Shooting, Kodak Black’s lawyer reached out the family of Kendrick Ray Castillo, who was shot and killed after lunging at the attacker, on May 11, 2019, and offered to pay for Castillo’s funeral, and set aside an annual $10,000 scholarship for any student wishing to go to college for science or engineering. His lawyer stated that the family had not yet responded. Kodak Black is an American rapper, singer and songwriter. His music is frequently about “previous and future criminal misdeeds”, and he stated that he’s been influenced by rappers Boosie Badazz and Chief Keef.
