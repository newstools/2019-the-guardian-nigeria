 Otun Oba, Ademola Abiodun Oniru (left); Odofin of Iru land, Chief Abisogun Saliu Okanlanwon; and Prince Tijani Oniru addressing newsmen on the resolution of the seven ruling families on the Oniru stool.  “We cannot afford, at this stage of our development, to allow some elements, who have no contribution to the development of Iruland, to take over the leadership of the city and reduce it to the vassal of some foreign interests. We cannot afford the stifling of our development in the hands of individuals who have no knowledge of how we got here.” On their choice of Aremo, he said: “It was Aremo Adesegun Oniru that assisted our late Oba in ensuring unprecedented infrastructural development in Iruland. He brought the whole family of Oniru together as a united force in the absence of which it would have been near impossible to make the landmark progress we have witnessed in recent times. The Oniru family, within the last 75 years, has transformed our collective existence to the pride of all indigenes. The best favour we can do ourselves is to ensure continuity of this spate of progress and development.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
