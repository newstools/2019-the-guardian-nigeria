Fioramonti wrote on Facebook that he informed Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of his decision on Tuesday, saying he had taken up the portfolio to “reverse… the trend that has for decades put Italian schools, higher education and research in conditions of great suffering.” He said the government had failed “to ensure a financial waterline… especially in such a crucial area as universities and research.” The resignation deals a new blow to the coalition government formed by Fioramonti’s M5S party and the centre-left Democratic Party just four months ago.
