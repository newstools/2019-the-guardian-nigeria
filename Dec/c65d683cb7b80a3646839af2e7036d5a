The centre for entrepreneurship development, Yaba College of Technology (YABATECH) chapter, has organised a trade exhibition to mark the 2019 Global Entrepreneurship week. At the trade fair, items made by students were put on display and sold off at an affordable price. Rector of the college, Obafemi Omokungbe, who was represented by the Deputy Rector Administration, Dr. (Mrs) T.A Ukabam, the exhibition was to showcase the students’ talents and with the economic values, for them to understand that there is no need to wait for anyone to employ them. Her words: “They can start up with this, sell their products and make money so that they will not be jobless after graduation. We want them to be occupied with their educational attainment, skill development so that even after being employed, they can still keep up with the trade, at the same time make extra money. So we want them to be balance theoretically, practically, and in skills development as well. “What they do does not cost so much, and some of them have extra money through industrial attachment at least there is a way they make extra money. So whatever they have made during the industrial attachment and other skills development they can use it to come up with other skills they are exhibiting to us.” Ukabam added that there is sponsorship, collaboration, and there is bank of industry here to help them through if they want to go into agriculture or entrepreneurship.
