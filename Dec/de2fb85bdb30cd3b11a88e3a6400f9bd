A 42-year-old landlord has allegedly defiled a 4-year-old girl in Ugbolu, Oshimili North Local Government Area of Delta State. The landlord identified as Ikechukwu Amon has already made preparations to settle the parents of the 4-year-old girl with landed property. The director-general of Behind Bars Initiative (BBI), Gwamnishu Emefiena Harrison, who initiated Amon’s arrest, said the incident occurred at Ugbolu, Delta State, and was reported on Thursday, December 27, 2019. “On the 27th of December, 2019, we got a report about a 4-year-old child that was brutally defiled by a 42-year-old Landlord in Ugbolu, Delta State,” Harrison said. “Swiftly, at 7:45 am, I led (the) BBI intelligence team to Ugbolu where we facilitated the arrest of Mr Ikechukwu Amon, the suspect.” Harrison said prior to his arrest, Amon’s family were already negotiating with the victim’s family to settle the case with a landed property before the arrangement was distorted. He said the victim (name withheld) is currently in need of medical care after her vulva and vagina walls have been severely bruised. Harrison, however, insists that the damage done by the suspected paedophile should not be negotiated. This, he said will put a stop abuse on vulnerable children.
