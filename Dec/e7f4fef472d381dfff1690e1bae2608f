GTA 5’s station is to be called iFruit Radio and is set to roll out on December 12, alongside the Diamond Casino Heist. What’s most interesting is the fact that among the 27-track playlist features, our very own Burna Boy and Naira Marley both have spots on it with “Killin Dem” and “Opotoyi” respectively. iFruit Radio will also feature a bunch of on-air guests including Skepta, others on the 27-track playlist include the likes of Freddie Gibbs, Yung Thug, Travis Scott, and Megan Thee Stallion. Check out the full tracklist below: Grand Theft Auto Online is now in its fourth year on PC, and it shows no sign of slowing down.
