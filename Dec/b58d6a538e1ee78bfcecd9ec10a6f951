The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which were; Guaranty Trust Bank, Cadbury Nigeria, Berger Paints, Dangote Cement, and CI Leasing. Analysts at Afrinvest Limited, said: “We maintain our bearish stance for the market, although the current low prices of stocks present opportunities for bargain hunting.” Also, Investdata Consulting Limited, said: “We expect mixed performance in the new week, on profit-taking, capital wave and expecting local fund managers to extend their position in undervalued equities with sound fundamentals, as domestic economy macroeconomic indicators look seemingly positive ahead of policy statements and economic reforms. “Discerning investors, nonetheless, should take advantage of the current low stocks valuation to position for medium to long term. It is noteworthy that the market is selling at a discount to give high upside potential. “We would, however, not overlook the possibility of a bargain-hunting motive supporting positive performance, especially with many fundamentally sound stocks remaining underpriced.” Market breadth was negative, with five gainers versus 28 losers.
