Even though Lil Nas X has had a chart-dominating year, the Old Town Road crooner is not slowing down. According to his latest Instagram Story post, the rapper seems ready to take over 2020. On Friday (Dec. 27), the star shared a poll via insta story with the singular question: “Who ready for new bangers in 2020??!!” Lil Nas X topped up 2019 by receiving his RIAA-certified diamond plaque for the record-breaking “Old Town Road.” Due to the song’s success, the rapper scored six nominations at the 2020 Grammys, including record of the year (for the first “OTR” remix alongside Billy Ray Cyrus), album of the year (June’s 7 EP) and best new artist. He recently reflected on the massive year with fans, tweeting: “I usually deal with my sad times in private because I don’t like for my fans or family to feel sorry for me. “This year had a lot of very high ups and extremely low downs. When u get to that hotel room and it’s just you, you do a lot of thinking. small things become so BIG.” While we await these “new bangers”, take a look at Lil Nas X’s hilarious hint via his insta-story: Lil Nas X’s nista-story | Photo: Billboard
