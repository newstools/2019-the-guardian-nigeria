Hundreds of people in Iwaro-Oka and neighbouring communities in Akoko South West Local Council of Ondo State, yesterday, trooped out to protest against recurring accidents and incessant killings of residents by heavy-duty vehicles. The road, which serves as a gateway to Abuja/Okene and Owo/Akure/Ilesa expressways, has several dangerous spots and bends that cause road accidents in the area. The protesters, who barricaded Iwaro-Oka Road and prevented vehicular movements, lamented they had lost several lives and property worth millions of Naira to accidents on the route. They carried placards with various inscriptions: “We are tired of accident on Akungba/Oka Road,” “Don’t turn our community into ghost town,’’ “Incessant accidents make us homeless,’’ “Our lives matter, no solution, no peace,” ‘’ODSG, construct alternative road on Akungba Oka Road,” among others. Chairman of Iwaro Oka Community Union, Dele Ologbese, said they decided to embark on the protest due to the menace caused by heavy-duty trucks. Ologbese said heavy-duty tankers carrying petrol usually set the area on fire, leading to widespread destruction of farmlands that have rendered many farmers jobless. He urged the state government to place permanent barricades against heavy-duty vehicles and provide alternate routes for them. The Regent of Iwaro-Oka, Princess Adekemi Omorinbola, said accidents were too rampant, lamenting that their complaints usually fall on deaf ears. Omorinbola urged the government at all levels to be proactive by proffering lasting solutions to the menace, adding that they should live up to their responsibilities of protecting lives and property.
