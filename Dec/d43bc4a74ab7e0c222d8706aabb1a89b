The Rise Of Skywalker was released on Friday and received a mixed reaction from critics, some who felt it wrapped up the series nicely, while others felt it did too much to redress issues some fans held with its predecessor, The Last Jedi. When Abrams was asked by Vanity fairs about how he feels with the review he is getting, he said: “I was asked just seven hours ago in another country, ‘So how do you go about pleasing everyone? I was like ‘What…?’ Not to say that that’s what anyone should try to do anyway, but how would one go about it? Especially with Star Wars. We knew starting this that any decision we made, a design decision, a musical decision, a narrative decision – would please someone and infuriate someone else. There is an MO of either ‘It’s exactly as I see it, or you’re my enemy’. It’s a crazy thing that there’s such a norm that seems to be void of nuance and compassion – and this is not just about Star Wars, this is about everything.” The filmmaker took over at the helm of The Rise Of Skywalker following the departure of Colin Trevorrow, who stepped down due to creative differences with the president of Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy. Once the current trilogy is complete, a new trilogy that will be directed by The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson is also in the works.
