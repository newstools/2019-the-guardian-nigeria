The rapper has been ordered by the court to enroll in an outpatient mental health program once he is free. This is according to new legal documents obtained by TMZ. In addition, 6ix9ine must continue to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney’s Office once he is released from prison in any ongoing investigations where he might be useful. As for his incarceration, the court has recommended Tekashi be placed in a correctional facility as close to New York City as possible, so his family can easily visit him. The rapper was sentenced Wednesday to 24 months in his racketeering case. However, he’s already served 13 months so he could be out by late 2020 if all goes well for him. Once he gets out, he’ll be on supervised release for 5 years, will have to complete 300 hours of community service, pay a $35k fine along with participating in the mental health program.
