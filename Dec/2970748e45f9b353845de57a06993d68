A crowd of football fans, including many wearing the Barcelona strip, gathered near the entrance as Suarez’s clubmates Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba arrived along with Ballon d’Or winner Messi and his wife, Antonella Roccuzzo. Brazilian star Neymar was also there, local media said. Uruguay striker Suarez and Balbi exchanged “rings inscribed with their respective names, made from white gold and diamonds”, according to a statement. The couple met when Suarez was 14 and started seeing each other soon afterward. They were married in 2009 and have three children.
