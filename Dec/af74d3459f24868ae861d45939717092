John who plays Finn in the sci-fi saga revealed how he had left the script for the ninth and final installment, Rise Of The Skywalker, under his bed, and forgot to take it with him when he moved out of his apartment. His agent called him after he heard from Disney CEO Bob Iger and Lucasfilm President Kathy Kennedy about how he lost the most powerful script in Hollywood right now. However, Disney managed to buy back the script back for “something like $85”, because the vendor hadn’t realised what he had on his hands, John added. Rise Of The Skywalker debuts in UK cinemas on 19 December, and will see John reunited with his castmates Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, Kelly Marie Tran, and Oscar Isaac, who all joined the Star Wars franchise in the first two films in the sequel trilogy.
