He was 21. The “Lucid Dreams” rapper, reportedly suffered a seizure while walking through Chicago’s Midway airport on Sunday, December 8. When paramedics arrived on the scene, law enforcement sources attested he was bleeding from the mouth. Although Juice Wrld was still conscious while being transported to the hospital, he was pronounced dead not too long after arriving. As of the time of the news, Juice Wrld’s cause of death is unclear. Despite never disclosing any health issues, in July 2019, he openly admitted to a lean addiction, in which he declared he was officially done with the habit. He shot to limelight in 2017 with his Nick Mira-produced track “Lucid Dreams,” which made its peak at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts and is currently five-times platinum (x5) with nearly a billion streams on Spotify alone. The song, which samples Sting’s 1993 hit “Shape Of My Heart,” became the subject of a threatening lawsuit by Sting himself. In an interview with Billboard, Sting called “Lucid Dreams” a “beautiful interpretation that is faithful to the original song’s form.” Juice’s reign was followed by more hits such as “Lean wit Me” and “All Girls Are The Same.” In 2018, he dropped his debut album Goodbye & Good Riddance as well as his collaborative mixtape with Future Wrld On Drugs. In March 2019, he released his sophomore album Death Race For Love, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.
