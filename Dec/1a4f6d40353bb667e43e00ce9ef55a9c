Meanwhile, the six US Congess-men who wrote to the Federal Government on release of Citizen Sowore can take credit for the unexpected release of the prime suspects. That is also a big question to those who represent Sowore, specifically in Ondo State House of Assembly and the National Assembly. Where were they hibernating while state actors were violating Sowore’s rights? Whatever happened to representation, the most significant responsibility of legislators?
