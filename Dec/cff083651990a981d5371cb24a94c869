Oyo State chapter of Christian Association of Nigeria through its chairman, Rev. Benjamin Akanmu said this year’s Christmas celebration would be special, as they would be dedicating their secretariat. Also the state government has lined up many activities to ensure the period is well celebrated just as the state police said adequate provision has been made to ensure a peaceful celebration. Speaking through its Public Relations Officer, Olugbenga Fadeyi, he said street carnivals, bangers and knockouts remain banned. “On no account must anyone hold street carnivals, else, you will be arrested. Those firing and selling bangers are warned to stop as there are plain-clothed policemen deployed who will make arrests. We want people to celebrate in the atmosphere of peace.” “There will be aggressive stop-and-search on vehicles. When stopped for checking, don’t fight them but rather cooperate with them. Routine patrol is also there to ensure that all event centers and recreational facilities are well protected,” he said.
