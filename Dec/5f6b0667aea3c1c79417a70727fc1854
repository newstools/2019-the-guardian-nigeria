English Premier League club Arsenal have announced former captain Mikel Arteta as the club’s new head coach, weeks after the sack of Unai Emery. Arteta played spent five seasons with the Gunners between 2011 to 2016. “This is a huge honour,” Arteta said after signing a three-and-half year contract with Arsenal. “Arsenal is one of the biggest clubs in the world. We need to be competing for the top trophies in the game and that’s been made very clear to me in my discussions with Stan and Josh Kroenke, and the senior people from the club. “We all know there is a lot of work to be done to achieve that but I am confident we’ll do it. I’m realistic enough to know it won’t happen overnight but the current squad has plenty of talent and there is a great pipeline of young players coming through from the academy.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
