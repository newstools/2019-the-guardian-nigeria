The Federal Government, through the Department of Agricultural Extension, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD) has trained 50 people, comprising 40 small scale farmers and 10 Agricultural Extension Officers on Noiler Bird poultry value chain production and management in Abia State. Speaking during the flag off of the two-day training, under the Ministry’s agricultural extension farmers education programme, the Extension Department’s Representative, Mr. Ibrahim Jimoh said the trainees would be taught all aspects of the poultry value chain that would facilitate the thriving noiler bird production in the state and the entire Southeast zone. He described noiler birds as hybrid bird with unique characteristics that include easy rearing, fast growing/maturing and self-reproduction within a short period, adding that the training has come at a time when the Federal Government is taking agriculture to the next level. The host state’s ADP Manager, Chief Israel Amanze, while declaring the training open, corroborated that the birds adapt easily to environment and even fend for themselves, adding that the state ADP accords farmers training top priority, hence farmers failure in the country has been traced to their inadequate or lack of training.Spokesman of the trainee, Mr. Ubani Onuoha, who commended the organisers said they were eager to learn and not only put the knowledge acquired into practice, but to extend same to others in their communities.
