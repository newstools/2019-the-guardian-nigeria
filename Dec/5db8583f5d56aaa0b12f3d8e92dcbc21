Four of the dead were children, traffic police added. Some 18 passengers who were injured were taken to hospital, with officials unclear if the bus driver was among them or had fled the scene of the crash. The passengers were returning from a pilgrimage to Kalinchowk Bhagawati, a popular Hindu temple located at a heigh of almost 4000 metres in the hills of Nepal’s Dolakha district, around 140 kilometres east of Kathmandu. The cause of the accident was not yet known, but police said reckless driving down the steep and winding road could have been a key factor. Deadly traffic accidents are relatively common in the impoverished Himalayan nation because of poor roads, badly maintained vehicles and reckless driving. At least 18 passengers were killed when a bus plunged into a gorge in central Nepal last month.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
