The Nigerian equities market reopened on a bearish note yesterday, occasioned by losses in some bellwethers, as the All- Share Index (ASI) depreciated marginally by 0.04 percent.
 
At the close of transactions, the ASI decreased by 11.56 absolute points or 0.04 percent to close at 26,990.59 points. Similarly, the market capitalisation lost N6 billion, and closed at N13.027 trillion.
   
The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which were; Cement Company of Northern Nigeria (CCNN), UAC of Nigeria (UACN), GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Nigeria, Guaranty Trust Bank, and FCMB Group. Analyst at United Capital Plc expressed optimism that investors would lock in value stocks with attractive dividend yields in anticipation of December dividend yield despite the decline seen in the first trading day of the week.
   
“This week, we expect investors to lock in value stocks with attractive dividend yields in anticipation of the December rally.”Also, Investdata Consulting Limited, said: “The current undervalued state of the market offers investors opportunities to position for short and medium-to-long-term views. We expect that investors would target fundamentally sound and dividend-paying stocks for possible capital appreciation as the year draws down.”
