Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has expressed support for the directive by President Muhammadu Buhari for a forensic audit of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), noting that the state ranks highest in the commission’s abandoned project list. Obaseki said this when he received the acting Managing Director of NDDC, Dr. Gbene Joi Nunieh, with other members of the Interim Management Committee (IMC) in Benin City, the Edo State Capital. The governor also frowned at the top-to-bottom governance arrangement of the NDDC, adding that it can’t develop the region, stressing that the commission’s defaulting contractors must be jailed. “To resolve the issue of corruption in NDDC, people must go to jail. Those who supervised and managed these contracts and every other persons found culpable must be made to face the law,” he said. Governor Obaseki, who congratulated the commission’s boss on her appointment, assured that his administration will work with the new NDDC management to ensure it meets its goals. In her response, Dr. Nunieh said the commission was in the state to inspect some of the roads and projects the NDDC listed as completed, abandoned, failed and on- going. She noted: “President Muhammad Buhari has ordered for a forensic audit to commence and we have gotten documents ready and the process will start in January 2020.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
