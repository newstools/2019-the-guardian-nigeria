File Photo  While the impact of border closure may appear to be waning, festive-induced demand took a toll on food prices, as the consumer price index, (CPI) which measures inflation increased by 11.85 percent (year-on-year) in November 2019. This is 0.24 percent points higher than the rate recorded in October 2019 (11.61) percent. Increases were recorded in all COICOP divisions that yielded the Headline index. On month-on-month basis, the Headline index increased by 1.02 percent in November 2019, this is 0.05 percent rate lower than the rate recorded in October 2019 (1.07) percent.The composite food index rose by 14.48 percent in November 2019 compared to 14.09 percent in October 2019. This rise in the food index was caused by increases in prices of Bread, Cereals, Oils and fats, Meat, Potatoes, Yam and other tubers, and Fish.
On month-on-month basis, the food sub-index increased by 1.25 percent in November 2019, down by 0.08 percent points from 1.33 percent recorded in October 2019. According to analysts at Cordros, the surge in food inflation stemmed from farm-produce (+36bps), processed food (+101bps) and imported food (+4bps).“However, the initial reaction from the border closure seems to be fading, as food prices, on a month-on-month basis, dipped marginally by 8bps. “We expect festive induced demand, coupled with the impact of the border closure to have a negative pass-through on food inflation. That said, despite continued FX stability and liquidity,  we expect core inflation to increase further, given the low base from the corresponding period in the prior year. Overall, we expect headline inflation to sustain its upward trajectory, expanding to 12.05% y/y (0.92% m/m) in December”, they added. Labour expert, Paul Omoijiade noted that increase in workers’ salaries will not deal with the situation, rather he canvassed on indexing, which he said, tallies with rise in inflation. He cited indexing as being used in the western climes, whereby the higher the inflation, they will merge it to commensurate with workers’ salaries. He said there is the need to look at indexing to properly align inflation with the wage rate.
“It is not increasing salaries that will deal with the solution. Issue of indexing is the solution. If there is index it will tally with inflation. If workers expect prices to rise, they will demand higher wages so that their real (inflation-adjusted) wages are constant. However, wage inflation and general price inflation continue to rise. Therefore, over the long-term, higher inflation would not benefit the economy through a lower rate of unemployment.”He said closing the borders is not the issue but government coming up with policies that will better the economy.
