 Abubakar Malami  In a statement issued yesterday in Kaduna, the secretary-general, Chief Willy Ezugwu, noted that the only way President Buhari’s administration could consolidate on the war against corruption was by standing up against corrupt politicians who would want to take over as president or governors in 2023. According to the umbrella body of opposition parties in the country, the Federal Government must ensure that all presidential aspirants for 2023 are thoroughly investigated for corruption. “This will further deepen the war against corruption in the country,” it said, describing the Attorney-General’s hint that no fewer than 22 former governors were either on trial or facing investigation over corruption allegations as a welcome development.CNPP maintained that Buhari’s administration would be leaving an indelible footprint behind by ensuring that those with questionable sources of income did not make it to the seats of power in 2023. “Like the AGF rightly pointed out, sustainable growth, which will ultimately lead to national development, will be a mirage, if corrupt men and women are not stopped from ascending to public offices. “We urge the Federal Government to invest more in corruption prevention strategies and collaborations, which is cheaper than corruption fighting, to sustain the gains so far on the anti-graft initiatives of the government,” he added. Ezugwu recalled that Malami, who had spoken at a meeting with journalists in his Abuja office last Thursday hinted that high profile personalities, including judicial officers and former governors indicted for corruption, had been prosecuted and many sentenced to jail. “We have three former governors convicted and serving various jail terms for corruption-related crimes while in office,” Malami was quoted as saying.
