Pharmacists Council of Nigeria (PCN) has urged the National Assembly to promptly review the laws put in place to prevent the proliferation of illegal medicine stores and consumption of such illicit substances in the country. The PCN director of enforcement, Pharm. Stephen Esumobi, decried the obsolete laws, which many government agencies established to fight against the menace operate with, lamenting that they undermine their operations. While speaking with journalists in Akure on at the weekend, he revealed how the PCN team sealed 301 medicine shops dealing in illicit drug in Ondo State.He affirmed the council’s resolve to stamp out persons violating the National Drug Distribution guidelines.He noted that the extant laws do not meet the current realities and situations to fight illicit drug distribution. “The laws need to be strengthened because they are very weak. We are not here to get people out of business and for punitive reasons, but all we desire is that they should be compliant to the rules and regulations. If drug distribution system is regulated, crime would reduce.”He therefore urged the National Assembly to promptly intervene in reviewing the extant laws so as to aide the work of the various agencies fighting against the proliferation of substandard drugs in the country.
