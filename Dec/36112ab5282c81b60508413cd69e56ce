He joined the club’s academy as a coach under former manager David Moyes before moving into the senior backroom staff in 2014. The 47-year-old’s passion for the club was evident in the win over Chelsea, with many observers reckoning it had sparked a more committed display from a struggling Everton side. Silva’s 18 months at Goodison Park ended on December 5 after a Merseyside derby defeat that left Everton languishing in 18th place. Moyes has been linked with a return to Everton and there has also been speculation that Carlo Ancelotti could be a target after the experienced Italian manager was sacked by Napoli on Tuesday. Former Arsenal manager Unai Emery and Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe have also been suggested as full-time successors to Silva as has Manchester City assistant Mikel Arteta, a former Everton midfielder.
