Thai Shrimp Rice | Photo: Getty Images One dish that never seems to get old is rice, especially in this part of the world, where events or family gatherings are incomplete without rice. This can be seen in the different forms it takes to the side dishes compatible with it. We are constantly looking up ways to accommodate it into our eating schedule without it looking to be the same dish every time. So as the year begins, spice up your rice recipe. Ingredients Method NB: Remember to wash all that needs to be washed thoroughly. Also, be careful with the soy sauce as it is a bit salty, so you put that in mind when adding your seasoning. Be sure to taste to make sure everything is in order and your food is ready. Enjoy.
