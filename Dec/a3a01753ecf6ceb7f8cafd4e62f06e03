Tekashi 6ix9ine | Urban Islandz Skyy Daniels, one of 6ix9ine’s victims is totally happy at the fact that the rapper will not be home with his family for the Christmas celebration which she also couldn’t do last year because of him. Speaking further on the incident, she said the rapper deserves to rot in his cell for the holidays away from his loved ones, and he’s got even more paying back to do after that according to TMZ. Skyy was one of the people who got held up at gunpoint by Tekashi’s Nine Trey Blood gang members which turned out to be an awful case of mistaken identity. They thought she and her assistant were Rap-A-Lot Records associates and it turned out they weren’t. Skyy detailed the pain and anguish she was put through as a result of Tekashi’s actions in her victim impact statement. While Tekashi wasn’t one of the guys who robbed her at gunpoint, he was in the car recording the whole ordeal, something Skyy considers equally as cruel and deserving of a harsher punishment. The American rapper, Daniel “Tekashi 6ix9ine” Hernandez, was today sentenced to two years in prison with five years of supervised release. The sentence includes the 13 months already served, which means he is expected to be free late 2020. Hernandez will serve 300 hours of community service when released and also pay a $35,000 fine.
