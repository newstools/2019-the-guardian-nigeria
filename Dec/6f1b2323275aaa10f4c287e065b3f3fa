 Turkish airline  “There are reports circulating in several news websites that claim Turkish Airlines operations in Nigeria are suspended or to be suspended by Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA),” Turkish Airlines said in a statement on Friday. “We would like to announce that our operations continue in all of our destinations in Nigeria.” Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) on Friday said it has suspended Turkish Airlines from operating in the country due to frequent unsatisfactory services it offered to Nigerians. NCAA director-general Abdullahi Sidi in a letter stated that the suspension was necessary after it held series of meetings with the airline without any change in its services. Sidi expressed displeasure on frequent cases of the airline leaving passengers’ luggage en route into Nigeria behind despite checking them in. The NCAA boss said the suspension could continue “if no remedial action is carried out by the airline.” “This issue had made passengers carry out several mob actions at our airport and it was a great threat to our airport facilities,” Sidi said. But Turkish Airlines said the “news reports on the subject do not reflect the reality.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
