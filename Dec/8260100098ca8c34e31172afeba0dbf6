No fewer than five persons were reportedly killed in Edo State following a boundary dispute between the Itsukwi and Imiakabu communities in Etsako East Council Area of the state. The Guardian learnt that both communities have been engaged in a scuffle over the ownership of the land, but the dispute snowballed into crisis at the weekend when Imiakabu youths allegedly blocked the Okpella-North Ibie road, thereby preventing motorists and passengers from plying the route. Following the development, men and officers of the Nigeria Police were dispatched to the area to help maintain law and order, but the youths were said to have opened fire on the police injuring an officer, who was immediately rushed to the hospital. On Saturday, a team of policemen was deployed to the area to arrest the culprits, but the youths again opened fire on the police, which prompted a response from the officers and in the process five persons were killed including a police officer, while several others sustained serious injuries. Investigation revealed that the crisis over the boundary dispute has lingered for a while, but it has never degenerated into shooting and loss of lives. When contacted, the state Police Command Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Chidi Nwabuzor, who confirmed the incident, however, said no life was lost during the crisis. He said a police officer was injured in the incident and that the officer was receiving treatment at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Irua Specialist Hospital, Ekpoma. Nwabuzor said investigation was ongoing, adding that arrests would be made and those found culpable in the crisis would be prosecuted.
