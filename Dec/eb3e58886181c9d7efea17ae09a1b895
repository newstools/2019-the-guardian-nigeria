This year, Europe’s top banking supervisor brought branches of Swiss giant UBS as well as Wall Street’s JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs into its fold “following Brexit relocations”. In April, the ECB announced it would raise the supervisory fees it charges to the banks under its eye by 20 percent over costs related to preparation for Britain’s EU exit, bringing them to 576 million euros ($638 million). As well as Brexit changes, Italian banking group Cassa Centrale Banca – Credito Cooperativo will come under the ECB’s microscope from next year. The lender was born from consolidation in the country’s cooperative bank sector prompted by legal changes. Meanwhile three German development banks — LBBW, Landwirtschaftliche Rentenbank and NRW.BANK — will fall under only national supervision by the country’s Bafin financial markets watchdog, after a successful lobbying campaign.
