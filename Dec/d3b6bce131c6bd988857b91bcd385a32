One cannot deny that the musical chemistry between Chidinma and Flavour isn’t glaring; it is evident in any collaboration of theirs and of course, the recently released 40 years EP. Early in November, the 5-track EP was released along with the video of the title track 40 Years which led to many questioning whether or not the duo are just great collaborators or lovers. Serving as a lovely followup to both the aforementioned and Nkem, Flavour has now released the official video to one of the singles off the EP titled “Mma Mma”. The video begins with the ‘lovebirds’ playing on the beach and singing along to each other’s tune, before proceeding to a typical eastern traditional marriage setting. This [Mma Mma] good blend of highlife and R’n’B was shot by Clarence Peters. Watch Mma Mma below:
