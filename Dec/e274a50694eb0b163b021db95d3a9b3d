To demonstrate its determination to diversify the economy, and attendant revenue streams, the Federal Government hopes to generate about 56 per cent of its 2020 projected revenue from the non-oil sources. This target is probably being buoyed by recent successes from agriculture, and some Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) like the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS), Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS), Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Nigeria Postal Services (NIPOST), which were not making much returns, but now surpassing their set targets. The Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, revealed this plan in Abuja, yesterday while giving a breakdown of the 2020 budget. Ahmed stated that the aggregate revenue available to fund the 2020 budget is projected at N8.42 trillion (3.2 per cent) or N263.94 billion more than the Executive proposal and 10.9 per cent more than 2019 budget of N7.59 trillion “In aggregate, 44 per cent of projected revenues is to come from oil-related sources while 56 percent is to be earned from the non -oil sources,” she stated. The minister, however, said that the overall budget deficit is N2.175 trillion for the year 2020 representing 1.52 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which is within the threshold stipulated in the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) 2007. She added: “‘Budget deficit is to be financed mainly by borrowings from domestic sources put at N744.99 billion, foreign sources put at N850 billion and multi-lateral/bi-lateral loan draw-downs put at N328.13 billion respectively.” According to her, with the timely preparation and passage of the budget, it will restore the normal cycle, and would facilitate quick implementation commencing from January 1, 2020.

According to her, the projected N8.42 trillion revenue is 3.2 per cent or N263.94 billion over the Executive proposal, and 10.9 per cent more than the 2019 budget of N7.59 trillion).
