Former International, Garba Lawal, has expressed excitement over the latest form of Super Eagles outcast, Kelechi Iheanacho, who secured a vital win for his English club, Leicester City at the weekend’s Premier League fixture against Alex Iwobi’s Everton. Iheanacho scored the goal that secured Leicester City the three maximum points after laying the pass that set up Jamie Vardy’s equalizer. Speaking to The Guardian yesterday, Lawal, who stated that scoring goals makes a striker important in a game, said it gladdened his heart that Iheanacho was back to the form he was known for. “It is fantastic to have him back in the Leicester team after being overlooked due to loss of form. His position is a very difficult one, especially playing in a striking role and you are not scoring. “But now that he is playing and scoring, I hope he maintains the rhythm, and strive to impose himself on the team at Leicester City for more opportunities,” he said. “Iheanacho has always been part of the Super Eagles until his loss of form due to his inability to command a regular shirt at his club. So, it won’t be news if he is called back to the Super Eagles again. “The most important thing is for him to continue to work hard as he showed against Everton. And he also attributed this to hard work in training and that he will keep his head up for more opportunities to prove himself,” he said. Giving his view on Argentina and Barcelona’s Lionel Messi emerging as the Ballon d’Or award winner, the former Eagles’ utility player said he wasn’t surprised the Argentine won his sixth award. “Messi deserves to win the Ballon d’Or because no one else performed better than him this year. Before he was declared winner, I had already given it to him. Messi is an exceptional player and he merits the award,” he stated.
