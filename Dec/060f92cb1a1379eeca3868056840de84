Coming off the success of the Lagos edition of Johnny’s Room Live held in October, the Abuja edition, which took place on December 8, 2019, at Central Park, Garki 1, and the Benin edition at Image Gardens, Boundary Road, Benin City on December 15, 2019, was all shades of exceptional. Fans of the alternative-rock singer came out en-masse to experience premium entertainment because of Johnny’s musical prowess and dexterity and of course in an emotive ambiance. Both shows were entertaining, interactive and fun for everyone in attendance, thanks to the thrilling performances from different musical acts. The Benin edition had winners of the Enter Johnny’s Room Challenge – Deyji Music, Deevhyne, Stephanie, and Ochi Or- perform as opening acts for the night. The sensational folk singer performed a good number of both his collection and that of his role model, American rapper and singer, Jon Bellion. His energetic and scintillating performances sent fans haywire, as they kept asking for more. Ace musician Ladipoe thrilled at both the Abuja and Benin stages, while Ric Hassani also graced the Abuja stage as they performed their fans’ favorite, one which left them with a feeling of nostalgic satisfaction. Both nights were electrifying, to say the least, and one could tell that the fans immensely enjoyed the show as they got their money’s worth at the sold-out Abuja and Benin editions. One of the major highlights of the Abuja edition was when a fan proposed to his heartthrob, while Johnny performed his hit single, Romeo and Juliet.
