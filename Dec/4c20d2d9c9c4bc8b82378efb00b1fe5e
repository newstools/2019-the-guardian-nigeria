The league of senior major marketers in the Northeast zone has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for appointing a substantive director to head Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), saying the appointment would stabilise operations of the organisation. The group’s spokesman, Alhaji Abubakar Wazir, yesterday, in Yola, said lack of substantive head in DPR was affecting the agency’s productivity. He called on the President to retire all deputy-directors and zonal operation controllers  to pave  way for the new director, who was an assistant-director before his appointment, for effective running of the agency. Waziri expressed confidence that President Buhari would act quickly and decisively to carry out major shakeup in DPR.
