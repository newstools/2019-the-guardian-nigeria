• Abia residents lament forfeiture of assets to FG Reactions poured in yesterday in the wake of the 12-year jail term bagged by a former Abia State governor Orji Uzor Kalu for fraud. For the Buhari Media Organisation (BMO), the conviction was proof of President Muhammadu Buhari’s sincerity in fighting corruption, even as some residents in the state described the forfeiture of assets to the Federal Government as unfair.
  
In a statement signed by its Chairman Niyi Akinsiju and Secretary Cassidy Madueke, BMO said the conviction of a high ranking APC chieftain proves that the courts are independent in this dispensation.The statement reads in part: “For some time, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its supporters had been casting aspersion on the anti-corruption crusade, especially in the run-up to the 2019 elections.
  
“The claim then was that all a politician seeking protection from trial needed to do was to join APC. And this was even after two former governors who are also members of the ruling party, had been convicted and sent to jail.“This speaks to the focus and uncompromising nature of the administration. If a high-ranking senator is in jail, then clearly a message has been sent out on the rule of law.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
