Bailey was then released on unconditional bail pending a further hearing, likely to be on January 20, he added. The suspect told reporters outside court: “I knew that this was going to almost certainly happen, so it doesn’t come as a surprise to me.” Buttimer told AFP the arrest had been a formality, allowing “legal argument as to whether the French application for Mr Bailey’s removal from Ireland is lawful or not lawful”, he added. Court officials said the endorsement of the European Arrest Warrant was not an order for extradition but simply to initiate court extradition proceedings. A French court earlier this year convicted Bailey in his absence of killing Toscan du Plantier, the wife of a prominent French film producer, at her holiday home in County Cork, southern Ireland. The former freelance journalist, who lives in Cork, has repeatedly denied the charge. The French court sentenced him to 25 years in prison. Ireland has twice refused to send him to France to stand trial, saying police had questioned him twice about the killing but failed to find any substantive evidence. It has also cited the lack of an extradition agreement with France. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
