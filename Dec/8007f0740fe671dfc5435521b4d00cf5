National Chairman of the National Conscience Party (NCP), Dr. Tanko Yinusa, yesterday maintained that any government that does not obey rule of law had no business with democracy. Also, a senior lawyer, Jibrin Okutepa (SAN), has said, “when any government chooses to treat court orders with levity, it will be unlawful for such government to expect obedience from its citizens.” Reacting separately to the release of Omoyele Sowore and Col. Sambo Dasuki (rtd), they condemned the Federal Government for doing “what is right when it was too late.” According to Yinusa, “the truth is that democracy is about law and order, no matter how you may look at it. As a leader, probably it is not too favourable to what you intend to do, you must obey the rule of law and order. “If you don’t, then you don’t have any business with democracy.” He added: “Therefore the action of government was even too little, too late, not a little but too late. The intervention both locally and internationally was against the leadership due to its lack of respect for rule of law and order. “The government needed a face-saving measure to overcome the name-calling of an administration that has no respect for rule of law and order.”On whether the letter from the four American congressmen was a factor, he said the Muhammadu Buhari government needed to do something quickly to avert reprobation. Yinusa noted:  “The release of the two political detainees was not anything unusual to me. It is not something new. As democrats, we would have preferred the government followed rule of law immediately the court made its pronouncement that they should be released. “They have the liberty to appeal to the Supreme Court until when you can prove the particular person guilty. It is internationally recognised.”“Those being released can count themselves lucky based on the international and local intervention.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
