Taylor Swift Tops 2019 Highest Earning Artists List | Image: Cosmopolitan American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift has been named as the highest earning musician of 2019. On the list compiled by Forbes, the “Love Story” singer made $185m (£148m) in pre-tax earnings from June 2018 to June 2019. Swift’s earning comes from a new record deal with Republic Records, her endorsements deals and finishing up her Reputation stadium tour. This is coming after the highly publicized drama between the singer and her erstwhile music label Big Machine Label Group has abated. This is the second time Swift would top the list in five years. Following Taylor is born again rapper Kanye West with $150 million thanks to his Yeezy clothing line, Sunday Service and his new album, Jesus Is King.
