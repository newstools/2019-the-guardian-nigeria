King Eyamba and Duke Town Families have demanded that the Police commence an immediate investigation into the alleged disappearance or killing of His Royal Highness (HRH), Etubom Okon Ekpenyong John Eyamba XVI. The Assistant Inspector General (AIG), in charge of Zone 6, the Department of State Service (DSS), and the Etubom’s Council of the Palace of Obong of Calabar were copied in the petition. Chief Efa Ekpenyong Eyamba said the petition was written because, traditionally, when an Etubom transits, he is either interred in his residence or the Hawkins Cemetery in Calabar. Another petition was issued to the moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Nigeria, Hope Waddel, Calabar, the Reverend in Charge of Duke Town Presbyterian Church, Eyamba Street, Calabar, urging them to shun the planned birthday celebration for Etubom Eyamba.
