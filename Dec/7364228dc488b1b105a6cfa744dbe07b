The bill for the creation of four emirates councils transmitted by Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje on Thursday scaled through the third reading and finally passed by the assembly. Meanwhile, the security men attached to Kano state house of assembly had threatened to shoot some journalists who were at the assembly to cover the house proceedings. The security personnel including men of the Police and Civil Security and Defense Corps had prevented journalists access to the assembly to carry out their official duties. It took the intervention of the director of press at the assembly who prevailed on the overzealous security operatives to restore calm. The new Kano State Emirate Council Bill 2019 had passed the first reading and second reading on Monday and Tuesday after the speaker, Rt. honourable Abdl’uazeez Garba Gafasa presented the letter transmitted by Governor Ganduje. In a unanimous acceptance, the legislators consented to the passage of the bill shortly after the lawmakers reconvened from the committee of the hole. Before the bill was passed, the lawmakers had dissolved into the secretary meeting for 20 minutes. The fresh bill was approved by the Kano state executive council and transmitted for the lawmakers following the nullification of Kano Emirs Appointment and Depositions Amendment Laws 2019 by Justice Usman Na’Allah of Kano high court. The creation of the emirates and their first-class emirs in Karaye, Bichi, Rano, and Gaya has generated controversy many believed it was an attempt to cripple Emir Muhammdu Sanusi’s royalty supremacy, no thanks to the ranging crisis between the monarch and Governor Ganduje.
