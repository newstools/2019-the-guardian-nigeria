Edo State Deputy Governor, Rt. Hon. Philip Shaibu has been appointed All Progressives Congress (APC) political leader of Edo North Senatorial District following the suspension of the party’s National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole.
 
APC leaders from the wards and local government in Edo North took the decision during an enlarged meeting that included Governor Godwin Obaseki, at Jattu-Uzairue, Etsako West Local Government.
 
The meeting had in attendance, Edo State APC chairman, Mr. Anselm Ojezua; members of the state executive council, as well as party delegates and leaders at wards, local government councils, state and national levels.
 
Alhaji Usman Shagadi, APC leader from Etsako West, said: “The only leader we know in Edo North is Hon. Philip Shaibu, and we support the Obaseki-led administration, because it is people-oriented,” echoing the decision of other party executives in the Senatorial District. Obaseki said: “Oshiomhole thought he was setting a trap when he chose Philip Shaibu as my deputy and Osarodion Ogie as Secretary to the State Government. He was thinking that we would always quarrel, fight and then run to him for settlement. The party and its members do not support godfatherism in the state. If you behave like a godfather, we will fight you.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
