The Federal Controller of Works in Edo State, Oke Owhe, an engineer, said this during the inspection of ongoing repairs and maintenance of roads in the state. Owhe said maintenance and repair of existing roads and highways in Edo and across the country, was part of Federal Government’s efforts at reducing carnages on the road during the Yuletide. He expressed satisfaction with the progress of work, adding that they were almost at their completion stages. “The federal highways that need rehabilitation in Edo State include Benin- Ekpoma- Auchi-Okene Highway, Benin-Sapele-Warri Highway and Benin-Agbor-Asaba highway among others.
