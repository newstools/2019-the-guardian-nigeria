• Oshiomhole not an all-powerful chairman, says Ojezua
• IGP unfair to victims of violence, says Oroh AS the political supremacy battle between Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, and the National Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, enters a crucial stage, indicators have emerged that the ruling party might end up with a parallel governorship primary early next year. The division between Governor Obaseki and Oshiomhole widened beyond measure last Friday, after the collapse of the much-hyped mega rally organised by the APC faction loyal to the national chairman to receive some prominent defectors from the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
  
Top on the list of the APC returnees was the 2016 PDP governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, Tony Omoaghe, Donald Boih among others. They were to be officially received into the fold of the ruling party at the proposed Garrick Memorial School ground, Benin City but were restrained by a combined team of security agencies on the orders of the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Adamu Mohammed. However, Oshiomhole, who blamed the botched mega rally on the conflicting signals from the IGP, Mohammed, and betrayal by some of his former lieutenants, particularly the Deputy Governor, Hon. Phillip Shuaibu is said to be working towards the forthcoming governorship primary to put Governor Obaseki “in the political garbage bin.”
 
Sources within the APC national headquarters confided in The Guardian that as far as the national chairman was concerned, “the Friday rally was a big success,” as according to them, it is now a matter of record that Ize-Iyamu, who gave APC a run for its money at the last election, has joined the party.  “I have gone to court, the matter is in court,” he declared.
 
Also speaking on the situation in Edo State chapter of APC, a former commissioner for agriculture and member of the seventh federal House of Representatives, Hon. Abdul Oroh, chided the IGP for taking sides in the disagreement between the two factions, alleging that the police boss was not being fair to victims of violence orchestrated by supporters of Governor Obaseki.
  
The former federal lawmaker disclosed that APC national chairman applied and was granted permission to hold the rally, explaining that for half of the membership of Edo State’s PDP to be decamping to his party, the chairman saw it as a huge political capital. He lamented that unknown to the national chairman, the IGP wrote the deputy governor, who ordered that the rally be put on hold, stressing that if the IGP had informed Oshiomhole of the latest development he would not have bothered travelling to Benin City.  Meanwhile, Edo State Government has described as a faulty start Ize-Iyamu’s mode of entry into APC, especially given the imbroglio between Governor Obaseki and the national chairman. In a statement, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Media, Mr. Crusoe Osagie, declared that “by now, all those who thought Governor Obaseki was a pushover that could be tossed around by a political godfather should have concluded that they were seriously mistaken.” Insisting that the failed mega rally revealed the demystification of Oshiomhole, Osagie noted that the national chairman “had come in an attempt to receive former governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2016 Guber elections, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, into APC, but the events that played out in what would have been a show of dominance turned out to be a disgraceful outing.” A lot of political watchers in the state have come up with different permutations as to what would have led to Pastor Ize-Iyamu return to APC after so many years of acrimony between him and Oshiomhole, to whom many years before Ize-Iyamu had served as a Director-General for his governorship campaign but fell apart shortly after Oshiomhole came into office. The loudest of arguments is the fact that Oshiomhole had shopped for candidates to replace Obaseki within his team, but could not find anyone with enough political capital and network to match the force and popularity of the incumbent governor. But the first question really ought to be, why would Oshiomhole be shopping for someone to replace Obaseki, if he indeed means well for the development of the state? Given Obaseki’s performance rating, shouldn’t the matter be about mending fences and working to consolidate on the gains being recorded? Even if those were to be overlooked, analysts ask why would Ize-Iyamu want to force his way into APC, when the body language from the camp of the governor, who is a leader of the party in the state, was for him to hold on and follow the schedule of activities the state chapter of APC had outlined for such occasions. However, what was made clear with the forceful – some would say disgraceful – way Pastor Ize-Iyamu came into APC, was that he has comfortably pitched his tent with Oshiomhole’s duplicitous faction in the state, and instead of strengthening the party, as he claimed he intends to do, Ize-Iyamu is attempting to deepen the division in the party, which many believe is the game-plan of Comrade Oshiomhole, who, it appears, thrives on chaos. The flop further exposes Oshiomhole’s weakening political base, which at best is populated by political rejects. Youths, who ordinarily would have rallied round him, had staged protests across major roads in Benin metropolis on Thursday, warning that desperate politicians were importing thugs from outside the state to cause mayhem. In a statement before the proposed rally, the Secretary to the State Government, Osarodion Ogie, had announced: “The Government of Edo State has, over the past few days, made clear its position that the plans by some identified mischief-makers to organise an unauthorized political rally in Benin City, was capable of leading to a breakdown of public peace and also a danger to the persons and property of Edo citizens. “The events of yesterday, 12th December 2019, were a scary prelude to the absolute mayhem which these irresponsible activities would generate if left unchecked. “In defiance of the clear and publicised instruction of the Inspector General of Police (IGP), calling off the proposed rally owing to the security implications, these desperate persons are presently shopping around for alternative venues to carry out their incendiary activities.” With all of these staked against the rally, there obviously was no way it could have successfully held, given not only the charged political atmosphere but also the lack of support from those who had once called Oshiomhole their political leader.
