The University of Lagos, UNILAG Muslim Community, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the merit award conferred on dedicated Nigerians who have proved to be exceptional in public service. Chairman, UNILAG Muslim Community, Prof. Lai Olurode, in a commendation letter made available to The Guardian, applauded the recognition of the Comptroller-General of Nigeria Customs Service, Hameed Ali and that of Registrar, Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Prof. Ishaq Oloyede as deserving of productivity merit award. Olurode said: “The two institutions are truly exceptional and had really shown that we need not be consistently skeptical about our own goodness. “Perhaps, there are thousands outside of these two individuals who can perform far better. The lesson in these exceptional case studies is for other public office holders to take note of factors that had assisted the rise of these organizations to pockets of effectiveness,” he stated. Olurode however enjoined government to ensure that other moribund institutions rise to performance. “At the UNILAG Muslim Community, we congratulate them for their being specially recognised by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.  We urge them to keep up the good job and begin to mentor others for institutional effectiveness so that their exit would not usher a reversal of successes that had been attained. Individuals cannot travel far but institutions can,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
