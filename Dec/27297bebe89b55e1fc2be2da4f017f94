Smiles were put on the faces of students, teachers and parents of St. Michael African Church Primary School, Ipari Nla in Ijebu North East, Ogun State, shortly before the school closed for holiday when the Rotary e-Club of Greater Nigeria, District 1925, donated school uniforms, sandals, exercise books and customize school bags as part of its Basic Education and Literacy Project for 2019-2020. At the presentation, the club president, Rotn. Oluwaseun Hassan, said the club has only done what Rotary is known for around the world by putting smiles on the faces of individuals and communities. “We are happy to provide these items for the children of this school and we would continue to do that in any school that needs such as a priority.” He said the initiative was borne out of the commitment to give back to the community and encourage reading culture, adding: “Basic education is one of the ways we carry out our community project and this project aims at revitalizing the reading culture among students.” He urged governments at all levels to focus more on the education sector to boost and raise the bar in academic excellence among students. The head teacher and PTA chairman of the school respectively expressed gratitude, on behalf of the students, for the gesture, which they described as “an extraordinary Christmas gift” and something they never expected while the leader of the community, Chief Adekunle Adeniyi, thanked members of the club for choosing the school in his domain. The excited pupils celebrated the gesture with songs and dance in a colourful ceremony graced by members of the club. Each student went home with a new uniform, sandal, eight packs of exercise books and customized school bag.
