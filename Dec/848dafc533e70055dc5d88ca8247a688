Jason Derulo Offered $500,000 To Post Semi-Nude On Porn Site | Image: Stuff.co.nz American singer-songwriter Jason Derulo has been offered $500,000 [₦180,750,000] by a porn site in exchange for posting his semi-nude pictures. TMZ reports that the adult site, CamSoda is making Derulo the offer just to share sexy photos of himself in his underwear. CamSoda says that it will create his own page where he can share pictures, videos and live streams. This is coming after photo-sharing app Instagram had taken down a steamy photo the “Trumpets” singer had posted two weeks ago on his Instagram page. In the image, Derulo was clad in form-fitting black underwear while standing in shallow water. Instagram took down the image for going against the platform’s guidelines on “nudity or sexual activity”. Derulo reposted the original photo alongside the complaint, with the caption: “F*k u mean? I have underwear on… I can’t help my size..” He also took to his Instagram stories to complain: “Y’all ain’t gonna believe this. Instagram took down my Bali pic! They took down my Bali pic! Hey, listen, all these girls showing their a** and all kinds of crazy s**t and I have underwear on in Bali and they took my pic down. It’s discrimination. Like, I understand, I can’t help my size, but you can’t take down my pic.” In his latest Instagram update, Derulo posted an edited version of the banned photo with the caption, “Is this better?”   Is this better?
