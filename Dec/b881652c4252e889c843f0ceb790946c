Chicken covered in Barbeque sauce | Photo: Chick and Naan It is the Christmas season and there would be a lot of cooking, most especially frying. Why not save more oil and grill that chicken? Grilling and searing aids the use of sauces for our chicken and turkey. However, is it safe to use store-bought sauce? In my own opinion, I would say maybe not. It is easy to control whatever you eat by determining what goes into them. In this series, we would learn the different sauces and how to make them in your kitchen. Today’s recipe is the popular barbecue sauce. Yes! A lot of you think grilling chicken alone makes it “BBQ Chicken”… Wrong! The barbecue sauce makes it actually “BBQ”. The homemade barbecue sauce brings out the best flavours in any grilled meat and the best way to use it is to only apply during the final stage of grilling and while the meat is resting.
