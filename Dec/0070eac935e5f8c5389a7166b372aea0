The celebration was graced by men and women from the three local government areas that make up the federal constituency as Makwe at the event distributed bags of rice and cash to his people. The federal lawmaker also inaugurated ten community liaison officers selected from the ten communities of his constituency noting that the aim was to ensure that his achievements are stepped down to the hinterlands. He assured them that he has not disappointed them as he has already intervened on some issues as it affects his constituency. He stated: “The aim for this gathering today is for us to stay together and celebrate. I want to let you know that I’m back for Christmas. Thank you for voting for me to represent you at the national assembly. We have not stayed together in this large number and that is the reason for this Christmas party. The most important thing is for us to stay together and eat, laugh and know each other better. “Our people should be applying for jobs and send us the slip so that we will follow-up. Ohanivo graduates should help us in this regard by playing their own role. If you don’t apply, there is nothing we can do about it. “I have to appoint ten persons from the ten communities that make up Ohanivo constituency. The essence is that I will be able to get your views on issues, request for financial assistant, medical assistant among other things on time.
