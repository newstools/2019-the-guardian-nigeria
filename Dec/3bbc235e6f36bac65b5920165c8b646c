But we thank God for the level of officiating introduced by the LMC (League Management Company), which has now given confidence to teams that they too can win an away fixtures. This now means that teams can win or draw anywhere during league games. “My team is just up coming up because in football when you are trying to build up a new team, a lot of things happen and we are trying to make sure that we don’t put ourselves under pressure. “Though, we haven’t got our rhythm yet as we still have some lapses to correct in the team. The new philosophy I introduced will take some time before the players can adapt,” he said, adding that some players don’t respond to tactics during match situation even when they showed promises at training. Thank God we’ve been able to overcome that and hopefully, we will get result in tomorrow’s match,” Ilechukwu stated.
