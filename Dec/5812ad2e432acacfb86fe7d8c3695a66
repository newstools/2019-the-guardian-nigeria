Tierney has suffered an injury ravaged start to his Arsenal career after a £25 million ($33 million) move from Celtic in August. The 22-year-old did not make his debut until late September due to a hernia operation and has made just five Premier League appearances. Tierney is now also a doubt for Scotland’s Euro 2020 playoffs in March.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
