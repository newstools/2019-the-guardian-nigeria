Yoruba Youth Socio-cultural Association (YYSA) Worldwide has urged the Federal Government to withhold the December pay of any lecturer that fails to enroll in the Integrated Personnel Payroll and Information System (IPPIS) scheme. This was contained in a statement made available to The Guardian in Ibadan yesterday by its president, Olalekan Hammed. The apex Yoruba youth body said: “The Federal Government should ensure that the consequence of gross obstinacy of some university lecturers under the aegis of Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) becomes reality by not paying them December salary. “University lecturers, who, with all standard, were believed to be highly respected and obedient to the authority, have reproved themselves through the contumacious attitude shown towards the IPPIS enrolment despite Federal Government’s order.” According to the youths, lecturers that are yet to register for the IPPIS can only take the Federal Government seriously if they notice that their salaries are no more paid. They added, “Failure to abide by any directive should be followed with consequences. The majority of the public/civil servants in Nigeria are extraordinarily stubborn, and only disciplinary action can make them comply.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
