There was a challenge as I suffered cramps on the road… I had to pull back and then apply ice on my leg. When I recovered from the cramp, I had to maintain my pace and pushed further to overtake the Nigerian runner, who was taking the lead at 30km,” he said.
 
Nigeria’s Pam Mwa said it wasn’t easy being a policeman and practicing for the race, adding, however, that he was motivated by the need to stop foreigners from clinching the prize in Nigeria and taking it to their countries. “I am a Nigerian policeman and I feel comfortable even though this is my first time running 50km race. “Since Nigeria was hosting it, I decided to participate because I have had enough of foreigners coming to win the prizes and taking it to their countries. I had to push them from the beginning up till 30km before they overtook me unfortunately and I kept my pace and finished third.
 
“It is not easy for a Nigerian policeman to do this thing because you have to be on duty and at the same time practice for the race. “I appreciate the Inspector General of Police, who has been encouraging me. I traveled to represent the Nigerian Police in China at the World Police Games, where I came third. “From there I picked up that motivation to compete with foreigners in Nigerian competitions,” he said.
