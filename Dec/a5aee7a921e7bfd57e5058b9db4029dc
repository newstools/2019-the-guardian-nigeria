The Oduduwa Secondary School Old Students Association (ODUSOSA) has honoured more than 30 former and serving teachers/principals of the school in its 2019 teachers’ appreciation day. The association, which earlier cleaned the Ladipo auto spare part market as part of the activities marking this year’s reunion, said they came together to contribute to a cleaner Lagos and also appreciate their teachers.
   
Chairman planning committee of Odusosa 2019 reunion, Omotunde Raji, said: “We decided to appreciate our teachers because of their contributions to who we are today by giving them a little from the token of what we have.”
 
First principal of Oduduwa Secondary School, Akinsanmi Folayemi, said: “I was the principal from 1983 to 1996. I feel elated to be honoured. I love my old students and I monitor their progress so, rubbing mind with the youths makes me happy and agile. Teachers’ reward is not in heaven. So, for me, I don’t lack anything. Some of them reach out to me and I’m reaping what I have sown because I have raised a lot of achievers. I already have a vice-chancellor among them. The Vice-Chancellor of Covenant University, Aderemi Aaron-Anthony Atayero, was also my student at St. Joseph Secondary school.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
