Kucheza Gaming, Nigeria’s first homegrown Esports company will host its inaugural Open Championship in January in a yet to be disclosed venue, the organisers have said. The gaming championship, Kucheza said, is for 6 to 18 year olds, adding that it would raise Nigeria’s profile in Esports, a sport where players compete playing video games. They explained that Esports is a billion dollar industry, which is a fast-growing sport in the world. Kucheza also disclosed that the company was hosting the Esports Open in partnership with Digital Schoolhouse, a UK-based non-profit organisation set up to bridge the gap between education and the games industry. At the event, 12 to 18-year-old students will be able to try competitive gaming, and Kucheza will offer parents information about potential career pathways for their children in the sector. “For the contest section of the day, players will compete in the best selling fighting games, which include Super Smash Bros and Ultimate Team Battle. “Winners will be awarded scholarships to further their education,” Kucheza said, adding that the company was planning other events across Nigeria. The overall winner will receive an all-expense paid trip to the U.K. to compete against international players, the organisers said. Founder of Kucheza Gaming, Bukola Akingbade, said Esports was a global phenomenon, adding that the organisation was excited to be leading the gaming sector in Nigeria. “Esports offers the opportunity for children and young people to develop 21st century digital skills while enjoying themselves in a safe environment. 
The Gaming Esports Open will be the first event of many, and we invite all children and parents to come and join us,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
