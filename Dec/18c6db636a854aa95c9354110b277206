A source told PEOPLE that the 27 year old songstress is concentrating on herself and her work right now and as well as her relationship with God. “She’s excited for what this next chapter in 2020 will bring.” the source said. Lovato responded to a fan’s direct message on IG, telling her followers to be kind to Wilson: “Please don’t go after him. He’s a good guy. Much better than what people see on the outside just because he’s got a lot of tattoos,’ she explained. The star went onto add: ‘Breakups are hard for both parties involved. Just stay nice and say prayers.” The pair first made their relationship public in November when she shared a romantic photo of herself with the 25-year-old shirtless model, who gave her a kiss on the cheek. (The photo of the pair has been since deleted from her Instagram account.) Wilson has also since deleted a photo of the pair from his Instagram page. The now-deleted photo previously showed him giving Lovato a hug from behind. “My Love🥰,” he wrote in the caption. Days after making their romance official on Instagram, Lovato and Wilson had their first public outing as a couple during a hike in Los Angeles. The most recent was on Dec. 14, the pair went to Disneyland together. Earlier this month, Lovato went dark on social media while teasing the release of her new music. Sharing only an all-black square on Instagram, the Grammy-nominated musician captioned the post, “The next time you hear from me, I’ll be singing….” Though no release date has been officially announced for a new song or album, this project will be the first solo project from Lovato since she left rehab in November 2018. Her last single, “Sober,” came out in June of that year, about one month before Lovato overdosed at her home in Hollywood Hills.
