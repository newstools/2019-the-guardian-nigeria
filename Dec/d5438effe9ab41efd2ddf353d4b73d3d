Investors’ sentiment turned negative after four consecutive weeks of gains last week, as the equities market defy the CBN’s policy-induced rally, recording losses across the five trading sessions of the week. The development triggered renewed sell-off last week, causing the NSE All-Share Index and market capitalisation to depreciate by 0.54 percent to close the week at 26,855.52 and N12.96 trillion respectively. All other indices finished lower with the exception of NSE Pension, NSE-AFR Div Yield, NSE Consumer Goods and NSE Lotus II indices which appreciated by 0.03 percent, 1.54 percent 1.71 percent and 0.97 percent respectively, while the NSE ASeM Index closed flat. Analysts predict gloomy outlook in absence of any positive driven pronouncement. Specifically, Codros Capital Limited said: “In our view, given the risked off sentiment dominating the domestic market, we expect the market to shed points in the coming week, except we see a policy-driven catalyst.”Nevertheless, valuations remain attractive, hence we expect pockets of gains over the final month of the year as fund and portfolio managers realign portfolios prior to the start of 2020.” Investdata Consulting Limited said: “We expect the mixed performance to continue as investors take advantage of the four correctional profit-taking and indecision among market players to position. “This ahead of the usual Santa Claus and year-end rally as capital flow and repositioning in value stocks will persist. There is also the changing sentiment in the expectation of improved liquidity and positive economic indices. “At the maturity of OMO investment, more funds will be available as CBN has restricted players to foreign investors and the local banks. Again, the current undervalued state of the market offers investors opportunities to position for short and medium-to-long-term views. “We expect that investors would target fundamentally sound and dividend-paying stocks for possible capital appreciation as the year draws down to usher in 2020. “The wait-and-see attitude of market players in the first trading week of December is likely to close negative, thereby halting the four weeks of bull-run.”Further breakdown of last-week’s transactions showed that a  turnover of 952.697 million shares worth N12.774 billion  was recorded in 17,279 deals by investors on the floor of the exchange in contrast to a total of 1.161 billion shares valued at N13.174 billion that exchanged hands last week.
