• Commission processed, cleared 24m SIM cards Operations of the Value Added Service (VAS) providers were enlarged in 2019, following the licensing of 10 new aggregators by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). The NCC in a document said the 10 new additions became necessary to deepen the market, and further improve scalability, with VAS market value now at $200 million, but projected to hit $500 million by 2024.
   
The Guardian gathered that the 10 new aggregators include I-Cell Multimedia Limited; Nina-Jojer Limited; 21st Century Technologies Limited; Nitroswitch Limited; HML Consulting Limited; and Iykejordan Limited. Others are Cognys Systems Limited, Perpetual Communications Limited, Mobile Intelligence Limited, and Aerandir Technologies Nigeria Limited.
    
The NCC said it is hopeful that the VAS aggregator licence will improve innovation, local content, employment opportunities, and increase in income stream to both network operators and content developers. The document also revealed that within the year, over 24 million validly registered subscriber records were scrubbed/cleaned-up (de-duplicated) via Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS), in fulfilment of the mandate to establish a credible database of telephone subscribers.
