French got a brand new blue Bugatti delivered to his pad in Vegas Sunday night. It was transported by Wires Only Luxury Car Dealer in L.A., using a special truck to protect it from scratches or other damage. According to TMZ, French wanted the Bugatti in time for New Year’s Eve to celebrate the year ahead and, presumably, the fact that he ended the year on 2 feet. French was hospitalized in November after experiencing intense stomach pain and an elevated heart rate. He spent nearly 2 weeks in the hospital, mostly in the ICU, before being released. French says he believes the medical emergency was caused by partying way too hard, 4 countries in 4 days. However, 50 Cent took to his Instagram to shade French Montanna for the news saying: “I’m in the hospital so sick of n!ggas,” 50 joked, seemingly mocking French saying he’d just gotten out of the ICU. “That’s a 2010 Veyron man, you shoulda just got the Uber app on ya phone ‍it’s 2020 Chiron Man hahaha Put that bullshit back on that truck. #lecheminduroi #bransoncognac #starzgettheapp #abcforlife.” French did not take this lightly as he affirms his Bigatti is indeed new and 5Ocent stop hating: “If you don’t take your jean shorts with ashy knees, and that two tone du rag back to Connecticut to that hunted house !” French wrote. “That u had to drive 2 hours there and back everyday from ny with yo Christmas in Alaska cold ass hating on a young nigga that’s a 2 million Dolla Buggatti with no miles collectors item ! Boi u a dinosaur lol” The two are always going back and forth on social media, hence, this is not something new.
