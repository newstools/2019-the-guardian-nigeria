Peering  Advocacy & Advancement Centre in Africa (PAACA), with the MacArthur support is to build capacities of Borno communities to fight corruption. According to Centre’s recent report, over 4,000 projects were abandoned across the country, because of alleged corruption in 774 Local Government Areas. This was disclosed by the Executive Director, PAACA, Ezenwa Nwagwu, at an Anti-Corruption Town Hall meeting, held at Command Guest House, Maiduguri.He said people’s capacities could be built and empowered with requisite skills to fight corruption. He said the skills are on people’s “sensitisation and collaboration” to carry out virtues of humility that impact on their lives.
His words: “The second phase of the sensitisation programme is to talk to members of communities about taking interest in councils’ annual budgets. “Educated people in the country do not know that state and local governments have annual budgets,” but only pay attention to Federal budgets when the figures are released to the public. “But the ones that directly affect majority of our citizens; do not care,” he said, adding that politicians take advantage of people’s ignorance on councils’ released budgets.He said because of ignorance, politicians will continue to rollback projects every fiscal year, and attributed the roll backs to indifference to the ‘recycling of projects’ in budgets. Nwagwu therefore said: “If we get citizens to begin to pay attention on states and local government issues, the fight against corruption will no longer be hanging. It will no longer be about arrests, prosecution, seizures, forfeitures, which excite members of the public.”He said the people want to see how resources of local governments can work for the majority of people in communities, saying: “We have to get the people from their communities and empower them with requisite skills of fighting corruption.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
