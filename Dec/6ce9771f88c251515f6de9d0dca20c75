Fuse ODG | Photo – Television Africa Nana Richard Abiona, better known by his stage name Fuse ODG, has cleared the air on the misunderstanding that trailed a social media post he made asking Ghanaian disc jockeys (DJs) to limit airplay of Nigerian songs so Ghanaian music can thrive. The Ghanaian–English recording artist who is best known for his 2013 single “Antenna” which peaked at number 7 on the UK Singles Chart has denied the reports that he asked the DJs to stop playing Nigerian music on radio stations and in clubs. In the misunderstood tweet, he wrote in pidgin English: “If you be Ghanaian DJ wey you no go play songs from undeground acts abeg you jus limit your NAIJA content!!! Cos if Nigerians had this opportunity we all know what’s gonna happen!!! Let’s sell Ghanaian music to these visitors properly!!! #YearOfReturn.” In a new video to clear the air, he has explained that he will never ask for Ghanaian DJs to quit playing Nigerian songs to promote Ghanaian music but rather, what he for was limited airplay for Nigerian music in favour of Ghanaian music. He also alleged that there is a policy in Nigeria for radio stations to play 80% of Nigerian music, a move he claimed has helped in repackaging and increased sales of Nigerian music. The artist asked Ghanaians to learn from this to sell their music at world stage. Sharing an IGTV video below, he captioned it: “Message to my people Ok so this whole Nigeria vs Ghana ting needs to stop when it comes to music. Time to address the lies these bloggers been spreading.
