Shelley died after her heart failed at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Her publicist Lori DeWaal said the actress had a brief illness before her heart gave out at the hospital. Besides her role in “Will and Grace,” Morrison was also best known for playing Sister Sixto on “The Flying Nun” alongside Sally Field in the 1960s according to CNN. Some of her roles included a Native American woman in “Mackenna’s Gold” in 1969 as well as minor Hispanic roles in movies like “Man and Boy” in 1971 and “Troop Beverly Hills” in 1989. In 1973 she met Walter Dominguez, a writer, whom she married. Through Dominguez, she became interested in Native American traditions, specifically the Lakota Sioux. The couple adopted six children through a traditional Native American ceremony, the biography said. Dominguez, the children, and numerous grandchildren survive her. She’d battled health problems over the years and was a breast and lung cancer survivor.
