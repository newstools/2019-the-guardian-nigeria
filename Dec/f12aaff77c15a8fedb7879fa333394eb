  The rally was meant to protest at the West African country's deepening economic crisis, but its organisers said there was lack of protection for protestors. The government had accused the opposition of calling for President George Weah's "unconstitutional eviction" and on Saturday warned all protests before the end of January would be blocked. On Monday, the Council of Patriots (COP) opposition said it had called the rally off after the government said it was unable to provide security and after international observers recommended postponement. COP Chairman Henry Costa, who helped footballer-turned-president Weah come to power, insisted the protest would take place nonetheless. A new date has been set for January 6, after mediation from international observers.

Costa told reporters later on Monday morning that representatives from the UN, EU, US and the West Africa bloc ECOWAS had complained to the government about blocking the protest.
