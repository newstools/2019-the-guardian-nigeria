To ensure that government realises its inclusive growth agenda, there is a need for the economic managers to formulate and implement policies aimed at improving the well-being of people at the grassroots.
  
The President of the Progressive Esan Club of Nigeria, Sunny Aluku, while speaking with The Guardian on the sidelines of its 10th anniversary celebration of the group. Aluku explained that the present administration must act fast to bring development to every nook and cranny of the nation by formulating policies that would impact directly on the lives of the common man.
 
In his words: “I want to say that there is a whole lot to be done because the truth is that if you go to every nook and cranny of this country, nobody is fully satisfied with what is going on. I think he should focus on formulating policies that would impact directly the lives of those at the grass root. The price of consumables is going up every day and we believe that if there is any policy to be put in place it should be aimed at bettering the lives of the common man.”He said the group is also planning to sponsor some of its members to participate in the political space to bring about national economic development, stressing that with its influence the club can contribute its own quota towards the development of communities and the nation at large.
  
On the anniversary celebration he said: “What we do every year is celebration to God. We bring our families together in celebration of another year end; but this year, we decided to up the ante a little bit because we are celebrating a decade of existence. We want the whole world to know that this club has come a long way and we are not resting on our oars.”
 
According to him, topmost on his mind is to ensure that all the Club’s members are fully insured and financially independent.“When I assumed office as president more than two years ago, I said in my first tenure I wanted the issue of insurance settled and today I am happy to tell you that every of our member is insured with a well renowned insurance company. I have just been elected to serve another two years and what I am going to pursue is the financial independence of every member and that is on board,” he added.He stated that as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) mandate, the club visited an orphanage to contribute towards their upkeep and education, saying that the club is in the long haul to give support to the less privileged in the society.
  
He noted that the club was founded to promote the rich cultural heritage of Esanland, promote the economic and social development of Esanland as well as promote unity, cooperation and good health of members enshrined in its constitution.“These we are already achieving gradually. We are definitely not there yet, but I am happy to say that we are focused, doing our best and we will not relent until our aims and objectives are fully met. The Esan Progressive Club of Nigeria is on the solid footing and will be very much around for a long time to come. God willing,” he said.
