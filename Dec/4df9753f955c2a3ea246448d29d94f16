Speaking at his marathon end-of-year news conference, Putin described the events in the US legislature as “simply the continuation of an internal political fight” between Democrats and Republicans. He reproached the journalist who asked the question for “speaking about Trump as if he is finished”. Trump was impeached Wednesday over a telephone conversation where he pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his potential White House challenger in 2020, the veteran Democrat Joe Biden. Putin indicated he believed this was only a pretext used by the Democrats to impeach Trump after failing to corner him over claims that Moscow interfered in the presidential elections that brought him to power. “The Democrats accused Trump of a plot with Russia, and then it emerged that there was no kind of plot. It could not be the basis of an impeachment,” said Putin. “Then they thought up some kind of pressure on Ukraine.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
