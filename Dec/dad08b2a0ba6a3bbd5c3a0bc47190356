The Nigeria Securities and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has recalled all senior officers on leave and pass to report for duties to ensure effective security during the Yuletide. Besides, the corps has also directed the zonal commanders and state commandants to ensure hitch-free festive period and beyond. Apart from the deployment of general duty personnel, sniffer dogs, specialised units, such as CBRN, Special Force, SWAT, Counter- Terrorism and ambulances, surveillance teams are to be deployed to strategic areas. Controller General of the corps, Abdulahi Muhammed Gana, in a statement in Abuja, yesterday, charged the personnel to ensure the protection of critical infrastructure within their localities against vandals and enemies of the state.He also charged them to work in synergy with other sister agencies, warning that the corps would not tolerate any form of sabotage and crisis between its personnel and other agencies.saying that partnership and collaboration is very pertinent, as all agencies are working towards a single goal of protecting society against insecurity. While advising parents to warn their wards to desist from any act inimical to society, especially as vandals and saboteurs capitalise on festive periods to carry out their nefarious act, the NSCDC boss pointed out that the law is no respecter of anyone. “Anyone caught, the long arm of the law will take it course, in line with the law of the federation; hence vandals, illegal oil bunkerers, oil thieves and operatives of illegal private guards companies should desist or relocate to another country, as there is no hiding place for them,” he said.
