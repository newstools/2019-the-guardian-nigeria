Chiejine • Declares desire to coach Super Falcons
Former Super Falcons Goalkeeper, Ann Chiejine has called for more grassroots football championships for girls, saying such programmes would help the country unearth hidden talents that would dominate African and world football in future. Chiejine, who was a special guest of honour in a recent five-a-side football championship in Ajegunle, said organising football championships in schools and at the grassroots level would entice young girls into playing the game like their male counterparts. Chiejine also called on corporate bodies, state, federal and local governments to join in developing the country’s female football by creating a sustainable programme for promoting women football at all levels. “Women football needs to be given more priority in Nigeria. There are enough talents around the country. All that is needed is for the relevant authorities to organise more grassroots championship to pick talents. “During my days it was not easy because there was not much awareness in women soccer at that time. But I worked hard to attain success. “I urge girls interested in soccer to keep giving their best, participate in every grassroots championship and from there they will grow to play for clubs and national team. The girls should not also forget to acquire quality education as they pursue their career in football,” she said. Chiejine, who just returned to the country after attending a coaching course abroad, added that she was ready to handle the Super Falcons if given the opportunity. “I am a Nigerian and I want the best for my country and the female national team. If I am given the chance to coach the Falcons, I will accept. It is a way to contribute my own quota to women football development,” she said.
