A general lull in the equities market, following preparations for the Yuletide, resulted in a highly volatile session at the end of transactions last week. Although positive sentiments trailed large-cap consumer goods and banking stocks, massive selloffs on the telecommunications giant, MTN Nigeria, eroded the gains, causing the market capitalisation and index to close flat. Consequently, the NSE All-Share Index (ASI) and market capitalisation declined by 0.04 per cent and 0.03 per cent to close the week at 26,526.35 points and N12.804 trillion respectively. All other indices finished higher with the exception of, NSE Premium, NSE-AFR Div Yield, NSE Oil and Gas, NSE Lotus ll and NSE Industrial Goods indices, which depreciated by 0.86 per cent, 3.14 per cent , 0.6 per cent, 0.06 per cent  and 0.49 per cent respectively, while the NSE ASeM Index closed flat. Analysts have predicted sustained volatility, with marginal gains, amid profit-taking and repositioning. According to them, investors were offloading their holdings in order to attend to some basic needs, which resulted in a decline in both market indicators. “We see the level of activity and volatility being sustained over the final days of the year, with some pockets of gains expected, as fund and portfolio managers realign portfolios prior to the start of 2020. The Chief Research Officer of Investdata Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omodion, said: “Market technicals for the session stayed negative and mixed, as volume traded was higher than the previous session, in the midst of selling pressure. “This is an indication that funds left some stocks and the market at large. We expect a sustained mixed performance amidst profit-taking and positioning. “This is just as investors take advantage of low prices to position, ahead of the usual Santa Claus and year-end rally as capital flow and repositioning in value stocks continue. “There are also the changing sentiments in expectation of improved liquidity and positive economic indices. “We expect that Investors would focus on the upcoming full-year earnings season, targeting companies with strong potential to grow their dividend on the strength of their earning capacity.” Last week, a turnover of 1.381 billion shares worth N15.504 billion was recorded in 14,528 deals.
