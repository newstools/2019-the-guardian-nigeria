At a time many people are losing hope due to vicissitudes of life, the General Superintendent of Deeper Life Bible Church, William Kumuyi, has proposed faith in Jesus Christ as the ultimate solution. Announcing the December national retreat of the church yesterday in Lagos, the pastor declared “the Saviour” as the most assured means by which people could experience turnaround in the challenges they face. He disclosed that the retreat themed ‘The Final Solution – Jesus’ would hold from December 21 to 25 at the Deeper Life Conference Centre, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, as well as the 774 councils of the country, in nearly 50 African countries and the rest of the world. Kumuyi announced a special invitation to all and sundry, noting that every solution proffered by Christ did not just momentarily solve the problems of men, but kept them in that blessing. He was optimistic that whatever spiritual or physical challenge was brought to Jesus at the retreat would receive attention and solution. “The retreat period offers a great opportunity for drawing closer to God and preparing every heaven-bound saint to keenly await the soon return of the Lord Jesus Christ,” the pastor said. Emphasising the need for all men to be spiritually awake and committed to the service of God, he announced that transport arrangement had been concluded to ensure that Lagosians attending the retreat were transported freely to and from the headquarters. The cleric will minister personally at the retreat from the Deeper Life Conference Centre, Lagos, where thousands of church members and guests are expected to congregate. From there, his messages will be broadcast real-time via satellite transmission to all the other retreat venues in Nigeria and abroad. The church said it had taken steps to ensure smooth traffic flow on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway throughout the duration of the retreat.
