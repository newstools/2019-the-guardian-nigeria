Management Committee Chairman of Jos North Council, Shehu Usman, has decided to change the negative narrative in the area, which witnessed ethno-religious crisis in the past. Usman demonstrated seriousness to this move on December 2, 2019 when he mounted in his office at the Council Secretariat in Jos the first Christmas Tree Lighting. The chairman, flanked by his wife and staff wearing Christmas caps yesterday, said humanity was one but with different ways of serving God. According to him, anyone who loves God must appreciate and respect other people’s religion other than theirs. The chairman had, since assuming office following his appointment as Management Committee Chairman, honoured invitations and participated in activities organised by both Christians and Muslims in Jos North. He had so far visited and interacted with the chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) other Christian leaders, as well as that of Jama’atu Nasril Islam (JNI) and other Islamic denominations. Usman also paid homage to the Gbong Gwom Jos, Uja Anaguta; the Adagwom Izere, Jos North, community and youth leaders as well as other interest groups. He expressed determination to persuade traders to relocate from segregated business places based on religion and return to markets where people of different faiths interact and transact business. The chairman said he drew inspiration from Plateau State governor and chairman of Northern Governors Forum, Simon Lalong, whose peace initiative ensured peace across the state and opened up the state once more to the outside world. Usman solicited the support and cooperation of citizens of Jos North for his administration, as well as the state and federal governments, assuring that more dividends of democracy await them.
