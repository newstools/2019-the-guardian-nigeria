It is always curious that Nigerian leaders at all levels always pontificate anywhere on a well known fact that education is the bedrock of development but they don’t invest robustly in it for the common good. By harnessing the innate powers of the intellect and knowledge base of the citizenry, many nations are promoting the advancement of civilisation – creating indigenous solutions to problems for our shared existence. 
 
The Federal Government again recently re-echoed this nexus between education and development during the convocation at the premier university in Nigeria. But beyond mere rhetoric, the Nigerian society must begin to shift from quality education as an afterthought, to proper funding of the educational system that we desire. Absolutely, a society already in dire straits of epidemic want, poverty and ignorance urgently need more than another empty promise of what good education can do. 
 
President Muhammadu Buhari at the 2019 convocation ceremony of the University of Ibadan (UI), again pledged to invest in education to make the country a knowledge-based economy. Buhari, who was represented by the National Secretary of the National Universities Commission (NUC), Prof. Abubakar Rasheed, said: “We will continue to invest substantially in education and government has not relented in its efforts to ensure that education is used to fast-track Nigeria’s transition to modern society.”   To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
