With the Lagos population expected to increase as more people migrate into the state, stakeholders have said the housing deficit is likely to rise except the private sector assists the government in bridging the gap. The Managing Director, Dpkay Homes and Properties Limited, Oluwole Sholola, who represented the Company’s Chairman, Dele Akinola, stated that the company is part of efforts to address the deficit for the population of Lagos State through its commitment in affordable housing. The General Manager, Yomi Kuti said while Lagos falls short of about 17 million house deficit, there is a need for players in the real estate industry to deliver qualitatively to change the face of Lagos, which is why the company, through its housing project will provide affordable homes to about 500 families in the state. Also speaking, the Company’s Legal Secretary, Oluwaseun Alao said while the firm seeks to share part of the government’s burden on housing to ensure people do not stay homeless, its aim is also to reduce the rate at which residents of the state fall prey to fraudulent activities in the real estate sector. “The government is doing a lot because they have a lot on their table. We appreciate that fact and that is why we say the government can help in bridging the house deficits in Lagos state,” Kuti said.
