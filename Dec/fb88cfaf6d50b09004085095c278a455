The yuletide celebration yesterday turned bloody in Taraba State following an attack reported to have been launched by suspected herdsmen in Gassol local government area of the state. The attack led to the death of two persons with many others injured. Also, many residents have taken to their heels to flee the community, Ukpera village of Yerima ward. An eyewitness said the attackers, in their numbers, took the community by storm while residents were celebrating Christmas with their families and friends. The eyewitness, who gave his name as Orhuna Daniel, said the gunmen were Fulani herders who have been at loggerhead with the villagers over grazing land in the village but which has now been deserted. Some members of the community who also spoke with our correspondent said the attack was a reprisal by the herders whose cows were recently macheted by some Tiv farmers in the area. Confirming the report, the caretaker chairman of the council, Alhaji Tanko Meikerfi, said two persons were killed by the gunmen in Yerwa area, adding that five others were injured with gunshot wounds while many houses were burnt by the attackers. He called on the authority to urgently deploy security personnel to the area.
