Victoria An appeal has been made to the government, non-governmental organizations and the general public to assist one-year-old Miss Victoria Uchenna Mmasichukwu, who is currently battling for her life at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LUTH). Her illness began two weeks after birth when she started breathing fast and was down with fever. When the illness persisted, a pediatrician advised she undergo echocardiogram scan, and that began the journey of misery for her parents as the scan detected a congenital heart defect but which can be corrected through open-heart surgery. Her mother, Mrs. Mmuoh Perpetua ifeoma, said the heart defect has seriously affecting Victoria’s growth, making her look visibly stunted. She recalled that the baby was hale and hearty and full of life at birth until when she started developing fever and doctors referred her to LUTH from a private hospital at Ogba. Narrating her ordeals, She told The Guardian that Victoria has been battling with the illness acutely since 9the age of nine months. “We have spent so much and we are still buying expensive drugs to sustain her before the operation. We have emptied all our accounts to save her life because she means everything to us now but we now drained and need the support of Nigerians to urgently raise N5 million for an open heart surgery in India by the end of March 2020.” According to doctors, she requires urgent cardiovascular evaluation and open-heart surgery to correct her heart defects in order to forestall irreversible and life threatening complications, with any delay very dangerous.
