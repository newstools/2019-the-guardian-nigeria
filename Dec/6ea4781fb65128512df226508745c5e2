The Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) has distributed irrigation pumps and fertiliser to 4,000 farmers in Borno State as part of efforts to restore their means of livelihood through crop and livestock production.
 
The organisation also trained and empowered about 150 beneficiaries in aquaculture and its value chain.
 
According to a 2018 post-harvest survey, the dry season support from FAO helped to generate N186,100 to each farmer from the sale of crops, including rice, tomato, and onions.  “Through livestock restocking campaign, beneficiaries are gradually rebuilding their asset base,” said Cisse, adding that beneficiaries did sell their bulls and reinvested their incomes in livelihood opportunities.
“We’re implementing initiatives aimed at boosting employment among youths and women in IDP camps and host communities,” he assured.
 
He disclosed that on the fishery interventions, the first batch of 50 beneficiaries of aquaculture inputs last April begun harvesting of crops and that they have stable sources of income now.
 
He added that 100 beneficiaries in four local government areas of the state were also trained in aquaculture with distribution of fishing kits.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
