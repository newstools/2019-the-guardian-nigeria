In 2017 to 2018, the group billed for 20,600 gigawatts hour (GWH) of energy from 2017 to 2018, amounting to N650 billion. From October 2018 to June 2019, the 10 DisCos raised their energy revenue collection to N466 billion, the report made available by ANED’s Director of Research and Advocacy, Sunday Oduntan said. Oduntan said: “This is a reflection of DisCos’ commitment to reduce losses, even within the context of the financial crisis of the power sector.” The group equally said it raised collection efficiency by 67 per cent, adding the latest statistics is higher than the N423bn collected from customers between October 2017 and September 2018 when the collection efficiency was 65 percent. Oduntan noted that the DisCos, while increasing their collections by N43bn in a year, by a rate that represents over 10 percent of improvement, also raised billing efficiency by five per cent during the period under review. In the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) Report submitted by the group to the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), DisCos indicated that their Aggregate Technical, Commercial and Collection (ATC&C) losses went down by 3.6 per cent within one year “The ATC&C was 49 per cent in 2018 and has been reduced to 45 percent in 2019. The reduction is even more significant, relative to a starting point of 54 percent, at handover, and within the context of liquidity challenges and lack of access to capital for investment,” the report stated.
