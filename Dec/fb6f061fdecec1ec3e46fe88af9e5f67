As Govt Donates N5m To Victims
Traders at the Tinker Motor Spare Parts Market, Coal Camp, Enugu, Enugu State, have applauded Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi for the efficiency of the state fire service in putting out the fire that gutted a section of the market in the early hours of Friday, without any loss of life. Expressing their feelings during the Governor’s visit to the scene, shortly after the incident, where he donated the sum of N5m, the traders, through the chairman of the market, Chief Crescent Ugwuoke, told the Governor that “these men of the state fire service you have upgraded and prepared for emergency work saved us today.” Ugwuoke, who thanked God that no life was lost, said the fire would have caused more damage if the state fire service did not respond swiftly. “We are sincerely grateful to you for your quick response to see things for yourself. We pray that God will continue to bless you in Jesus name. Amen,” the chairman said. The State Chief Fire Officer, Engr. Okwudiri Ohaa, who stated that the feat was a confirmation that “Enugu State is in the hands of God,” equally attributed it to “the type of support the Governor has been giving to us.” The chairman of Enugu North Local Government Area, Hon. Emma Onoh, who received the governor on arrival, thanked him for his prompt visit and deep concern for the well being of the people.
