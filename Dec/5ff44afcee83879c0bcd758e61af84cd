The police in Anambra State have declared Ifeanyi Ejiofor, a lawyer to leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Nnamdi Kanu wanted. “I will like to let Nigerians to know that as we speak, Barrister Ejiofor, an IPOB member and his cohorts have been declared wanted by the command,” Anambra police commissioner in the state, John Abang, said on Tuesday. “And I will seek the cooperation of law-abiding Nigerians from North, South, East and West, wherever they find this individual, they should report to the nearest police station or any other security agency for possible arrest and prosecution.” The police search for Ejiofor is in connection to the recent death of four persons in Oraifite community of Anambra State on Monday. Ejiofor’s home was invaded by the police on Monday after which two IPOB members were allegedly killed. Two policemen were also reportedly killed during the incident. Ejiofor is one of the lawyers defending Nnamdi Kanu in his treason trial with the Nigerian government. Kanu is on self-exile after the army invaded his residence in Umuahia, Abia State, in 2017.
