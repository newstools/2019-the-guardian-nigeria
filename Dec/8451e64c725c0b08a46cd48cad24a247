Gad and power portfolio company, Axxela Limited, has pledged its commitment to West African’s industrialisation through the build-out of its natural gas infrastructure. Speaking at Gas Forum (GGF) held in Accra, Ghana, the company’s Head of Sales and Marketing, Tunde Baba-Agba, said, “Natural gas is now highly regarded as a key resource of the energy sector, and a key component geared towards value creation for West Africa’s economies.” He said the firm was confident that its strategic initiatives and the expansion of its operational footprints, particularly within the virtual pipeline, gas processing and distribution, and embedded power spaces would help unlock the vast potential within important economic clusters across the region. Head of the Executive Committee, the Gas Consortium (organisers of the event), Senam Gbeho said: “By implementing the right policies and decision-making structures, the region’s gas resources would be the catalyst that can eliminate the continent’s distressing poverty levels. With the combined population and market size of the respective countries within the region, a real opportunity exists to collectively leverage existing gas resources, pursuant of industrialisation for economic transformation and social welfare.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
