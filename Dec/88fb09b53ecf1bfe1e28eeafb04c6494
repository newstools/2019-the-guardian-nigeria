The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) yesterday declared that Ogoni people are undeterred by the deployment of 5,000 soldiers for the resumption of oil exploration in the area. Its factional President, Fegalo Nsuke, who stated this while receiving the national executives of Alisor Youth Movement (AYM), explained that this was against their wishes and posed a threat to the safety of Ogoni people. “The desperation of the Federal Government, Shell and other oil firms to crush the Ogoni people who are opposed to continued oil exploration in their land will be against justice, respect for human rights, he said. Nsuke added that it was most unfortunate that a simple demand for justice and respect for basic rights of the Ogoni people had been treated so cruelly occasioning massive killings and abuses. Lamenting that the Ogoni situation was pathetic and terribly worse, the MOSOP President alleged that a section of the media had misrepresented the true situation in Ogoniland through the managers of the cleanup programme, describing the entire process and its handlers as corrupt. He said MOSOP would soon brief the world on the pitiable condition of the Ogoni people whose land is naturally blessed with abundant resources and has contributed over $200 billion to the nation’s coffers. While urging the Ogoni people to maintain their non-violent ways of agitating for their rights, Nsuke urged the Federal Government to rethink its repressive approach to the Ogoni problem and a accept dialogue. Earlier, Coordinator of Alisor Youth Movement, Sunday Gbaranugbe said they were committed to the Ogoni cause and pledged their continued solidarity, peace and justice until victory was won.
