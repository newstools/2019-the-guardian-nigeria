 Awolowo-Dosumu  Awolowo-Dosumu, while speaking during the Tribune’s Platinum Awards as part of its 70th anniversary, said the paper was out to celebrate excellence and stand by the truth.

Awolowo-Dosumu also gave an insight into the future of Tribune titles, stating that the “organisation is into the digital space”, just as she assured that medium would remain in circulation in the next 70 years. In his remark, the Managing Director of Tribune, Mr. Edward Dickson, said the paper is a national institution not only by the sfact that it was established by the late Chief Obafemi Obalowo but that “ Tribune preceded the independence of Nigeria.” Also speaking, Olagunsoye commended the organisers, recalling that his greatest achievement in office as Osun governor was his ability to end the Ife, Modakeke war.
