 Engaging millennials							                   			             SOURCE: Google  She said, “Many of them last less than two years in new roles, as they are constantly looking for the next challenging and fulfilling opportunity. Concerns regarding work-life balance, inclusiveness, flexibility and personal development are top of mind, and if not addressed, employers will continue to witness rapid exit of millennials from their organisations. When we did a statistics on the number of millennials in our school system. We found out that they make up about 55 to 60 percent of both the teaching and administrative workforce.
 
“Millennials have a lot of energy, which is good, but the ability to ensure that the energy stays positive and channelled towards achieving corporate goals is what leads to excellence. So we organised a session for them to listen to their experiences within the system, without their line managers or principals present. Learn what will make them stay longer in the organisation, understand what will motivate and keep them engaged, and that is what is expected of every employer. We need to hear them, otherwise we will lose them.”
 
Insisting that every progressive-minded organisation should periodically engage its workforce, the human resource manager said: “It is very important that they do that. The impact of the session we had with millenials was felt instantly, as we have received positive reports and feedback. In fact, two very talented millenials who had planned on exiting the system, stated that the programme changed their minds and made them feel more included and the HR department also responded instantly to feedback and made changes based on a survey conducted.” Also, one of the employees, Mrs Olaitan Koshimo, while sharing her thoughts after the session, said: “I feel like it was long overdue, and we need to have more avenues like this outside of the typical workday and environment where people can actually talk openly and share ideas. It is also a good way for the management to get feedback.”With over a 100 millennials in attendance, who openly expressed themselves without holding back, the event was considered a huge success, says Odunaiya.
