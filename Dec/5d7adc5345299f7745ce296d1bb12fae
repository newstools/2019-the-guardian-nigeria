This makes her the first black woman to do so in the chart’s 61-year history. This milestone comes amidst anticipation for the singer’s ninth studio album which has been teased in an interview with American Horror Story star, Sarah Paulson. Rihanna is still working hard despite her pause in music. Earlier in the year, she released a coffee table book with Phaidon, had her first Savage x Fenty show and released a T-shirt that says No more music. Billboard reports that Rihanna was ranked the seventh most-streamed female artist on Spotify in November. Riri as she is fondly called is a Barbadian singer, songwriter, fashion designer, actress and businesswoman, who has been recognized for embracing various musical styles and reinventing her image throughout her career. She earned significant recognition following the release of her first two studio albums Music of the Sun (2005) and A Girl like Me (2006), both of which were influenced by Caribbean music and peaked within the top ten of the US Billboard 200 chart. Rihanna’s third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007) incorporated more elements of dance-pop and catapulted her to greater stardom, establishing her status as a sex symbol and a leading figure in the music industry. Its international chart-topping single “Umbrella” earned Rihanna her first Grammy Award, winning Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.
