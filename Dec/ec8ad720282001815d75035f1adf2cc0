Created by a group of young entrepreneurs in agriculture, finance and IT, who are determined to solve the unemployment problems in Nigeria, the platform went live in July this year. Launched in Lagos, the platform provides job opportunities for everyone to earn additional income across Nigeria. The aim, according to promoters, is to get young people, including students, legally and gainfully employed for part time and holiday jobs, while creating an additional and sustainable stream of income for employees. Olawale Olajide, Head of Marketing and Partnerships, Yoshwork said, “We have been able to employ about 1000 young people and we believe there’s no reason for anyone to be in need of a job. We have been able to positively gain the attention of a lot of young secondary school graduates and have created holiday/part time jobs for many university students. Once you register on our website, you are instantly employed to do one task a week and paid N30, 000 into your ‘wallet’ on our platform. Such tasks include selling of designated NAFDAC approved products by local manufacturers and so on. You can further earn more by selling more,” he said. He informed that in addition to solving unemployment problems, the company, through its platform, is contributing its quota to solving the distribution challenges for SME manufacturers and product processors, who cannot afford the costly distribution systems run by larger Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) companies. Managed by reputable public figures and professionals including Christopher Kolade and others, Yoshwork plans to employ 5000 young individuals in each state of the country by the first quarter of 2020. It plans to reward the top 10 performers of JAMB/UTME that work on the platform with grants. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
