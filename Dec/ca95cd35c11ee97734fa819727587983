The news was announced on the Instagram story one of the model’s rep on Friday. She says “It is with deep regret and immense sadness that we announce the passing of Cacsmy Brutus (Mama Cax). Mama Cax spent the past week in the hospital, and unfortunately, on Monday, December 16, 2019, she left this world. To say Cax was a fighter would be an understatement. As a cancer survivor, she had grown accustomed to taking on life’s several challenges head-on and successfully. It is with that same grit (fervor) that she fought her last days on Earth. We are aware that this loss will be felt globally and will not be easy for anyone.” While her official cause of death has not been determined, Cax recently stated she was experiencing severe stomach pain and that several blood clots had been found throughout her body. Rihanna was among celebs to pay tribute to Mama, tweeting, “A queen. A force. A powerhouse beauty that brought her strength to the Fenty stage this year inspiring so many across the globe. Rest in Power sis.” Cax was born in New York City, however, she grew up in Haiti. At age 14, Cax was diagnosed with osteosarcoma and lung cancer, and doctors gave her three weeks to live. Two years later, she received a failed hip replacement, leading to the amputation of her right leg. She later said that it took several years to regain her confidence and that she hid her prosthetic legs for several years In 2019, Cax became the face of Olay brand for its sunscreen marketing campaign. She was also present at the show for the brand Fenty Beauty, launched by Rihanna. In October 2019, Cax announced she would be participating in the New York Marathon in a wheelchair.
