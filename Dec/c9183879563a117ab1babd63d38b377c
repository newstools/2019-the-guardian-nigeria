Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain, Femi Fani-Kayode, has told President Muhammadu Buhari not to meddle with the affairs of Oyo State. According to the former minister of aviation, the biggest mistake President Buhari will make is to either bribe or coerce the Supreme Court into nullifying the election that brought Governor Seyi Makinde to power. This statement came after the PDP in South West raised allegations that the president was planning to upturn the victory of Governor Makinde at the Supreme Court. This was said in a meeting, which was attended by top PDP members like the Deputy National Chairman, Yemi Akinwonmi; the Vice Chairman, North West, Senator Ibrahim Kazaure; National Vice Chairman, South West, Dr. Eddy Olafeso; and Dr. Doyin Okupe.In a tweet yesterday, the former minister advised the president not to tread that dangerous path, as it would result in nothing but calamity, chaos and disaster.
