Presidency has said the Human Rights lawyer Femi Falana’s claim that President Muhammadu Buhari is planning a third term in office is a plot to seek free publicity and media attention. “The popularly acclaimed human rights lawyer and formerly unsuccessful opposition candidate for governor of Ekiti state, Femi Falana, has boarded the free-publicity train, full of those seeking personal media attention in claiming the president is planning a third term in office,” Garba Shehu said in a statement on Monday. “To repeat: All and every claim that is made that suggest President Muhammadu Buhari will stand for a third term in office is false.” Falana on Sunday alleged that there was a third term agenda for President Muhammadu Buhari. The Senior Advocate of Nigeria said very soon Nigerians will start seeing manifestations of the ‘plot’. He spoke in reaction to suit filed by Charles Enya a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) that the National Assembly should amend the constitution to allow Buhari to contest for a third term, “I hope Nigerians have not forgotten that when the Babangida-led junta was going to extend its tenure, we had the Association for Better Nigeria (ABN) that went to court that the 1993 presidential election should not hold,” Falana said. “We thought it was a joke. So, very soon, Nigerians will have other manifestation over the third term agenda.” But Shehu said the Senior advocate claims are false and attention-seeking comment. He said the “President reminds all of those who wish it were otherwise, whether because they want a third term, or because they seek to make false claims for the purposes of their own publicity of the statement.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
