 President, CFA Society of Nigeria, Banji Fehintola  According to him, strong ethics and high standards of professional conduct play a vital role in the integrity and ongoing success of the investment industry. Ethics, he said, is what you do when no one is watching, and there is a need to build ethical awareness. “For instance, the capital market exist for a reason and when you talk about the capital market, there are people who have surplus money somewhere and they want to invest it, there are people somewhere who needs money because they want to run a business. “The only way we can connect the surplus and deficit together is to have a capital market intermediating in between them and those markets have to function properly for people to trust them. “The problem is when markets don’t function because people don’t trust the market, people who have surplus money never go to the market,” he said.
