The Reformed Oghomwan Mandate Group (ROMG) yesterday commended the leadership of the Edo State House of Assembly for declaring vacant the seats of the 12 members-elect yet to present themselves for inauguration into the seventh Assembly as well as two others that failed to meet the constitutionally approved 181 sitting days. The group also called on well meaning Nigerians, including the Otaru of Auchi, Aliru Momoh III and the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, to see to the cessation of the crisis.
 A statement by ROMG’s Director of History, Statistics and Strategy Wing, George Osagie Osaghae, in Benin City, urged the monarch to prevail on the former labour leader in the interest of peace. It commended the “uncommon display of courage by the Edo State House of Assembly Speaker, Mr. Frank Okiye, in declaring the 14 members-elect seats vacant.”Osaghae said the 14 absentee members’ action to stay away from office six months after inauguration of the legislature was a threat to democracy and the rule of law. “We must salute the uncommon tolerance level of Edo State House of Assembly Speaker Frank Okiye.“This call has become imperative as the Binis are more than ever unanimous that Oshiomhole’s pejoration against Governor Godwin Obaseki’s second term smacks of tribal hatred unless he is cautioned by the Otaru and well-meaning Etsako people,” he stated.He continued: “Whereas, a good number of Edo South members-elect are affected by the irrevocable plenary decision of the State House of Assembly, we wholeheartedly welcome the declaration and unreservedly so, because, the so-called honourable members-elect should not be allowed to continually hold the legislative progress of their constituencies to ransom under the unholy godfatherism of a brigand. “Fighting purposefully is a honourary duty, but fighting for the sake of being a notorious fighter is a vice, and must be condemned by all, hence, we condemn the reprehensible acts of hostility being waged against Governor Godwin Obaseki, Deputy Governor Philip Shaibu and Speaker Frank Okiye.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
