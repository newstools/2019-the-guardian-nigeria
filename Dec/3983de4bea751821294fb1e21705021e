The Tiv Youth Council (TYC) Worldwide has called for thorough investigation into the recent court invasion to re-arrest Omoyele Sowore. The TYC President,  Mike Msuaan, in a statement, yesterday, cautioned against sensational handling of the matter, especially when it concerned national security. The group alleged the invasion was carried out by Sowore’s supporters to blackmail the Department of State Security Services  (DSS). Msuaan said:  “Information at our disposal showed that Sowore and his supporters stage-managed the drama to stir public sympathy for himself, and embarrass the Nigerian State before the international community.“There was no DSS operative in court when his supporters decided to disrupt sitting. “It is also on record that Sowore contested for Presidency in the last general election and was rejected by the Nigerian people. Having woefully lost the elections, he resorted to calling for a revolution to overthrow the government of the day.  This is unacceptable by all true democrats and Tiv Youth Council Worldwide condemns such an unpatriotic act…”.The group warned lawmakers in the United States of America, especially Senator Robert Menendez to steer clear of Nigeria’s internal affairs, saying the country is a sovereign nation with her constitution.
