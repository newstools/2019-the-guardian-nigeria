The Nigerian Senate Wednesday stood down the confirmation of Olalekan Raheem as a Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). These were part of the recommendations of the Senate Committee on INEC which screened the nominees after President Muhammadu Buhari sought the Senate’s approval of their confirmation on October 29. A petition was written against Raheem alleging him of being a party cardholder of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Raheem, however, denied the allegation stating that he used to be a member of the APC but not anymore. “I am a member of APC and I contested for the chairmanship of Osogbo local government in 2013. In 2015, I moved on to go and study Psychology in University of Ibadan. I had the card then when I had the intention of contesting,” Raheem said. “I was a DG of a contestant in 2017. I was part of the campaign. I am no longer a card-carrying member since I left to go back to school. I have not been attending political function again.” Raheem wondered if there was any law that stops him from supporting a candidate of his choice. But after deliberation by the lawmakers during the Wednesday plenary, the senate resolved to stand down Raheem’s confirmation for further inputs The  Senate, however, confirmed the two other nominees Umar Gajiram(Borno) and Aialiibo Johnson (Bayelsa).
