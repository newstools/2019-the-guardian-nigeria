For winning the rematch against the Mexican, Andy Ruiz Jnr, at the weekend, President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated the Nigerian-born British world heavyweight boxing champion, Anthony Joshua, on the feat that eventually led to the regaining of his four belts. He also rejoiced with Joshua, saluting him for bringing joy to millions of Nigerians at home and abroad, who had rooted for him to regain the titles he lost about six months ago. “The downfall of a man is truly not the end of his life. There is always another and better day. This is a lesson we must all learn from you as a country,” the president said in a statement issued by his spokesman, Femi Adesina, yesterday in Abuja.
