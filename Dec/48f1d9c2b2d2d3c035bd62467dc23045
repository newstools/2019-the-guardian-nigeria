• Launch N100m Fund for Health Centre
The Ambrose Alli University (AAU) Alumni Association, Lagos State Chapter has decried preventable deaths and loss of lives in the university community, saying it was as a result of the decrepit state of health facilities. Speaking at an award dinner and launch of N100m appeal fund for the upgrading and renovation of the school’s health centre in Lagos, chairman of the chapter, Chris Iyere said a visit to the hospital revealed that the facility was operating with obsolete equipment, some dating back to the 1980s when the facility was established. He, therefore, called on the alumni to donate generously to the fund to enable the body put an end to the ugly trend. Pro-chancellor/Chairman of Governing Council of the institution, Chief Lawson Omokhodion, commended the group for its decision to give back to the university by raising funds for the upgrading of the institution’s health centre and the building of an e-learning centre and other projects. Omokhodion who was represented by Mr. Osezua Abhulimen, an alumnus of AAU, said the governing council, inaugurated in October 2018, has been tackling infrastructural dearth, wrong deployment of academic faculty among others. The pro-chancellor also commended the Founder of Christ Embassy Church, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome, and Chairman of the United Bank for Africa (UBA), Mr. Tony Elumelu, and other old students for their contributions to the growth of the university.
