A 35-year-old farmer, Segun Akinlade has allegedly been murdered by a herder, Muhammad Garba in the Imala area of Ogun State, following a scuffle over the invasion of the deceased’s farm by the suspect. The Guardian learned that trouble started when the deceased met the suspect’s cattle grazing on his farmland. In his bid to chase the suspect away, he fired a catapult, and the stone hit the herdsman on the forehead. The action infuriated the suspect, who attacked the deceased with a cutlass, resulting in Akinlade’s death. The State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, who confirmed the incident, said the incident happened on December 1, 2019, noting that the suspect has been arrested by his command. He said: “The suspect was arrested following a distress call received by the Police at Imala Division that fight had broken out between herdsmen and farmers, with the DPO of the division, CSP Mobolaji Jimoh mobilising his men to the scene. “At the scene, the deceased’s corpse was on the ground, while the suspect, who also sustained machete cut injuries were identified and promptly arrested.” Oyeyemi said the Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson has ordered the immediate transfer of the suspect to the homicide section of the state criminal investigation and intelligence department for further investigation and prosecution.
