Reused oil | Times Of India When we talk about cooking, oil is an essential part of it as it is used in so many different ways to enhance the flavour or give food a certain texture. As much as the use of oil helps us in the preparation of lip smacking dishes, it poses an unhealthy threat when we reuse leftover oil. In a bid to be economical, many households reuse the same oil over and over again to minimise wastage but it has been found out that this can have deleterious consequences on general well being and health. Keep on reading to find out some health hazards posed by the use of the leftover oil. Free Radicals Free radicals attach themselves to healthy cells in the body and may lead to certain health problems. Reusing of the same oil repeatedly has been found to lead to the generation of free radicals. Free radicals can lead to inflammation, cardiovascular diseases and even cancer. . Reusing oil can also lead to atherosclerosis that can cause an increase in the bad cholesterol, leading to blockage in arteries. Skin Problems Free radicals produced by leftover oil also affects the skin as it speeds up the aging process. NHE A study found out that a toxin called 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal (HNE) forms when such oils as canola, corn, soybean and sunflower oils are reheated. The survey indicates that consumption of foods containing HNE from cooking oils has been associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, various liver disorders, and cancer. Once absorbed in the body, HNE reacts with DNA, RNA and proteins affecting basic cellular processes. Food Poisoning Many times, the used oil is not properly strained before storing and as a result, there are leftover food particles in it. If the same oil is not refrigerated, it may facilitate the growth of the bacteria Ciostridium boutlinum which in turn produces toxins that can cause life-threatening food poisoning.
