The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has restated its determination to review the existing collaboration with the National Health Insurance Scheme on the provision of free healthcare services for Corps Members. Director-General of the service, Brigadier General Shuaibu Ibrahim disclosed this yesterday when Executive Secretary of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), Prof. Mohammed Nasir Sambo visited him in his office. The collaboration between the two establishments dated back to 2016 at the instance of the Federal Government, which directed that all corps members should be enrolled in the NHIS. While the DG stressed the schemeâ€™s zero tolerance for night journeys by corps members, he stressed the need for urgent attention to be paid to their health needs through the scheme. Responding, Sambo congratulated Ibrahim on his appointment as the 18th DG of NYSC, saying the NHIS was making efforts for Nigerians on foreign missions to benefit from the scheme.
