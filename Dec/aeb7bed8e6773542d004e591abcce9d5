He also warned randy lecturers in tertiary institutions to desist from harassing innocent students sexually in exchange for marks, or prepare to face authorities’ wrath. He spoke, yesterday, during the 44th convocation ceremony of the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, Osun State. While expressing the need for nation-building, Buhari called on the academic community to show more commitment to research, critical thinking, moral disposition, discoveries and inventions, with a view to inspiring national development. “The sex for marks syndrome is becoming rampant in our institutions of higher learning. The government will not hesitate to hit hard at any officials found culpable in such acts,” he said. He noted that universities were established for teaching, research and community service that would address the challenges of development and contribute meaningfully to making life better. Buhari, who is the Visitor to the university, and represented by the Deputy Executive Secretary, National Universities Commission (NUC), Dr. Sulaimon Raman, noted that OAU was renowned for its standard of practice, and that it had carved a niche for itself as a foremost university in the knowledge space. He tasked the university management to ensure continuity with the patrimony of excellence bequeathed to it by its founding forefathers. He, however, lamented the perennial decadence in the university system, and called on stakeholders to uphold standards at all times. Expressing worries that the intellectual brawns of Nigerian youths are made manifest much more abroad, Buhari called on youths to “start looking inwards, stay and advance the cause of their mother land. We should remain here, redefine our goals and salvage the country together.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
