He said the communities affected were, Enugwu-Ukwu, Abagana, Ukpo, Nimo, Nawfia, Umuokpu, Abba, Ifitedunu, and parts of Amawbia, left without electricity supply. According to him, EEDC regrets to inform her esteemed customers under Enugwu-Ukwu 33KV line that the current loss of supply being experienced is as a result of the vandalism of the 33KV network feeding them. “This network radiates from Agu Awka Transmission Substation, Awka, Anambra. “Materials carted away include five spans of aluminum conductors, all-fiber cross-arms and 33KV pot insulators and also a broken high tension pole. “Consequently, our customers in the entire Enugwu-Ukwu, Abagana, Ukpo, Nimo, Nawfia, Umuokpu, Abba, Ifitedunu and parts of Amawbia are without electricity supply,” he said. Ezeh said that efforts were on to fix the problem and restore power supply.
