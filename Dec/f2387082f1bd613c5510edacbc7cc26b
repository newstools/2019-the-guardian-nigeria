• Seek FG’s Support To Reach Over One Million Yearly A group under the auspices of Paynergy, in collaboration with Rotary Club of Jabi Lakeside, has supported over 150 kids with malaria treatment plan in Kuchigoro community in Abuja. Speaking at an event to flag-off the plan, the Chief Executive Officer of Paynergy, Chiedozie Akwiwu regretted that malaria has remained one of the most dangerous sicknesses in sub-Sahara Africa, calling for collective effort to reduce its occurrence. Explaining that the malaria scheme the body is offering to the community covers both testing, treatment and medication, Akwiwu stated that the sickness has killed a lot of children lately and a lot of people have died because they could not afford drugs as little as N100 or N200. He added: “We might be thinking that we are satisfied in dealing with malaria nation wide but the truth is that there are a lot of people that are not able to get the correct malaria treatment.” Disclosing that Paynergy has the capacity to handle over 100 malaria cases, the CEO called on the government to support the body in order for it to reach out to over one million children yearly.“If we can be handling over 100 cases, we have the dream of handling a million cases, but if the government can come in and help us, we can reach more babies because a lot of babies are dying from malaria,” Akwiwu said. On her part, the President of Rotary Club of Abuja Lakeside, Rabi Maidunama, who deplored the state of roads, clinics and water supply in the community, called on government to come in and alleviate the sufferings of those living in the community.
Maidunama, however, expressed the club’s readiness to do more for the community if it had enough funding. “If we had enough funds, we would have done more, change their roads, improve their water supply, including their clinics.“Most times, communities like this do not have access to proper clinics, sometimes they have to travel if they need a proper medical attention, so if help doesn’t come to them most of them don’t bother, that is why outreaches are good.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
