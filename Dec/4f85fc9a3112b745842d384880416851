The management of Turkish Airlines has denied reports that airline has been suspended from operating in Nigeria. In a brief statement issued by the airline, it claims, “There are reports circulating in several news websites that claim Turkish Airlines operations in Nigeria are suspended or to be suspended by Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). We would like to announce that our operations continue in all of our destinations in Nigeria. The news reports on the subject do not reflect reality.” Meanwhile, the Federal Government of Nigeria, through the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority, allegedly suspended the operations of Turkish Airlines in Nigeria yesterday due to the airline’s perceived poor treatment of passengers. NCAA said the suspension will continue “if no remedial action is carried out by the airline.” According to a letter by the Acting Director-General, NCAA, Abdullahi Sidi, it expressed displeasure about the rampant cases “of not bringing passengers into Nigeria with their checked-in luggage.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
