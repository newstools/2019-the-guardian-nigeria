Kwara State governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has debunked claims that the government sponsored a musical concert that featured pop star Wizkid in Ilorin. “The Wizkid concert was not sponsored or funded by the state government,” AbdulRazaq said at the public presentation of a pictorial compendium of conditions of infrastructures in the state. “It was purely a private sector initiative.” He, however, said the event was a welcome development to promote local talents in Kwara State. The governor also denied claims that the government spent N200m to organise an end of the year party, saying those behind the rumours were responsible for the current challenges in the state. AbdulRazaq said his administration will support initiatives that can help Kwara State tap into the potential in the entertainment and creative industry. “Ours is to provide the enabling environment for such initiatives,” he said. “Those who said we spent N50m to bring Wizkid also said we spent N200m on the end of the year party. They also said I bought bulletproof cars. These are laughable claims.” AbdulRazaq disclosed that he requested a meeting with Wizkid in his house on Wednesday where he sought a partnership to empower local talents especially the Kwara Idol and other government-owned programmes.
