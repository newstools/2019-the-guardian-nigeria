Speaking on the topic, Journalism, Development and Ethical Issues, Dr. Franca an Associate Professor in the Department of Sociology, Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Lagos, noted that journalists need to be creative in the midst of challenges in order to overcome the hurdles in the profession, stressing that the society looks forward to the media reportage for positive change. The Chairman Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Lagos State, Dr. Qasim Akinreti, in his remark, noted that the media in Nigeria focuses more on national issues such as politics, urging journalists to bring in full developmental journalism by redirecting their reportage to communities and human- interest issues. He charged journalists in the country to be at the front-burner in reporting violence against women and girls, and access to Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights. “I appreciate the UNESCO for organising such a forum to increase more awareness and promote the activeness of journalists on the thrust of the workshop. “ Knowledge that would be derived from the workshop would equip and enable the participants who happen to be members of the Fourth Estate of the realm and agenda-setters to champion constructive reports and editorials that would propel legislations that increase the access of women and girls to sexual reproductive health and rights and also eliminate violence against women.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
