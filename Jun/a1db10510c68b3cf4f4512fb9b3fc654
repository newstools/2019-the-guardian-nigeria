More than a month after she was delivered of a quadruplet and detained at the Enugu State University Teaching Hospital, Parklane, following her inability to pay her medical bills, Mrs. Ebere Precious Ugwu yesterday refused to leave the hospital after she was discharged. Her refusal was how she would cope with the upkeep of the children, Chizaramekpere, Chidiebube, Chimdalu, and Chimeremeze after her husband disappeared into thin air as soon as the babies were born on May 10. A mild drama had occurred as one of the media aides to Enugu State governor, Emmanuel Ikechukwu Jonathan, who paid her medical bills, had presented the receipts to her and announced that she was free to go home. Rather than leapt for joy, Ugwu resorted to weeping and insisted on going nowhere. It took the intervention and consolation of hospital workers for the mother of four to agree to go home. Jonathan and his wife, Nkechinyerem, who were at the hospital to set the mother and quadruplets free, called on the father of the children to return home. He stated that he was sure God would not let them down. Ugwu, who cried almost all through as the journey progressed from the hospital to the remotest part of one day road axis, Agbani road, where they occupied a deserted building told our correspondent that so much challenge still awaited her. “I graduated from the university since 2013 but I have no job; it is the same thing with my husband. So, it is really going to be difficult for us; you can see the place we are living; you saw how hard it was for us to get here,” she said in tears.
