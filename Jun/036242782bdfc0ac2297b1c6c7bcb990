Ajayi Boroffice, declared his intention, to seek the office of Deputy Senate President. “The intention to contest was anchored on the deep conviction that with his excellent public service record, rich legislative experience and personality, he has the best credentials for the position. “Consequently, he embarked on extensive consultations with party leaders, senators-elect and political groups. Indeed, everybody that was consulted agreed that he is eminently qualified to seek the office. “Instructively, majority of senators-elect have assured Boroffice of their support and the prospect of victory is high,”he said.
