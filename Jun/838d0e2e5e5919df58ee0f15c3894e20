Meanwhile, midfielder, Oghenekaro Etebo has revealed that team captain, John Obi Mikel is one of the most important persons in the Nigerian set up. Mikel was one of the five players Gernot Rohr dropped from the starting line up in the squad that faced Guinea on Wednesday, but Etebo says the former Chelsea man still had a hand in their victory. “I must tell you he is a good leader, a quality leader for that matter even when he is not on the pitch, he always encourages everyone.” Etebo disclosed that Mikel has been shielding the team from external political influence, adding, “he usually advised that we should stay as a nation, which is very important and I respect him because it shows he is a leader on and off the pitch. “The most important thing is that every team that wants to succeed sticks together because that’s what the manager also advises us, whether you are playing or not.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
