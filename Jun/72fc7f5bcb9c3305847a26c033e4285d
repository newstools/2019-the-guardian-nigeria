Versus the euro, the pound weakened to 89.69 pence. The next Conservative party leader will be elected by the end of July, leaving only a few months to try to renegotiate a Brexit withdrawal agreement. CFTC data at the end of last week showed traders had cut “net sterling shorts” by 563 million dollars but remained heavily short the pound.
