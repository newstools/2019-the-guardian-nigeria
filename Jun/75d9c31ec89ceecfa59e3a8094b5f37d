Household of God International Ministries, organisers of the yearly Karis Award has extended the nomination process to the general public, in order to allow them select qualified persons to be nominated for the awards.
   
The Karis Award, held every 2nd or 3rd Sunday of December, is borne out of patriotism and the need to foster national unity and zeal, without any religious, political, geo-political, tribal, or social bias. 
 
At a press conference at the church’s headquarters recently, Head, Benevolence Department, Mike Igbokwe, said the nomination of the Karis Awardee had been done by the head of department or members, his department and approved by the Pastor. The public was advised to visit the Karis awardee’s nomination website on www.hhkarisaward.org.ng to start participating in the nomination process. Igbokwe noted it is one of the church’s ways of giving back to the society. a prize of about N2million; recognising Nigerians, who have contributed to national development and encouraging patriotism, but his or her contribution has not been recognised adequately. However, “because the Karis Award has grown bigger and better, the Benevolence Department realised the need to take the nomination process beyond the department and the Household of God Church to the general public to give opportunities to many more persons worldwide, to nominate and more qualified persons to be nominated for the Karis Award annually.” To this end, he said, “the Benevolence Department has designed an interactive website that with effect from the 2019 Karis Award, any interested person(s) in and outside Nigeria can access it, follow and participate in the Karis Award nomination process.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
