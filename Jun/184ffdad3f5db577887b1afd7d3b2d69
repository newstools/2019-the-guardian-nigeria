 Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State  The chairman, Dan Orbih, stated in Benin City yesterday that the governor illegally stopped the legislature from performing its constitutional role.He called on the governor to do the needful and transmit the letter of proclamation to the clerk without further delay. According to Orbih, the country’s constitution is very clear on the roles of the three arms of government.“What is playing out today in Edo State is that the executive arm led by Governor Godwin Obaseki has clearly and illegally stopped the legislature from performing its constitutional role by refusing to send the official proclamation letter to the clerk of the house for the inauguration of the 7th assembly. “By this unconstitutional act, he has assumed the character of a sole administrator.“Edo PDP is uncomfortable with this unfortunate development. We knew the inherent dangers of the All Progressives Congress (APC) magical claim of 24 over 24. As a party, we want it on record that this unpleasant development has nothing to do with Edo PDP, but a product of greed and inordinate ambition of a non-performing government who is afraid of its shadows.” In the same vein, 19 of the 24 members-elect of the assembly have called on President Muhammadu Buhari, the APC and the National Assembly to prevail on Obaseki to inaugurate the house to avoid serious constitutional crisis.The 6th assembly is yet to be dissolved. Addressing journalists at the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) secretariat in Benin City, the 19 members-elect under APC led by Washington Osifo (representing Uhunwmonde) said there could not be democracy without the legislature; hence they accused Obaseki of attempting to truncate democracy in Edo. Noting that the tenure of members of the 6th assembly expired on June 7, they said by virtue of section 105(3) of the constitution, the governor was constitutionally required to immediately issue a letter of proclamation for the inauguration of the new assembly to avoid vacuum.But Edo APC chairman, Anslem Ojezua, said the leadership of the party had agreed on the composition of the assembly leadership.
