• Recover 20 from suspected ritualist shrine in Oyo
• Vigilance group arrests kidnappers, others in Rivers
The police in Anambra State have rescued two siblings from their abductors in Odume, Obosi, Idemili North local government area of the state. The police spokesperson, Haruna Mohammed, who disclosed this yesterday in a statement said the suspects, Maduako Chukwuka and Micheal Chukwuebuka were nabbed in Nkpor area of the town. He said the victims were abducted from their school and hidden in a hotel in Onitsha. “On June 4, at about 5:00p.m. following intelligence report, police detectives attached to Isiowulu Division arrested one Maduako Chukwuka ‘m’ aged 23 and Micheal Chukwuebuka ‘m’ aged 22 of Anglican lane, Nkpor in Idemili North LGA of Anambra State. “Suspects abducted two kids, Chinezerem Nkwoemezie, aged 10 and Nzube Nkwoemezie, aged eight, all males of same parents from their school on June 3 at Odume, Obosi and hide them inside an isolated hotel in Onitsha.” According to Mohammed, police detectives traced the hotel, rescued the victims unhurt and arrested the hoodlums. In another development, no fewer than 20 persons were evacuated from a shrine allegedly used as a den for ritualists at Agungun area of Ibadan by the Oyo State police command. The discovery, which attracted scores of residents of the area was made by officers of the Agungun police station, Ibadan, following intelligence report. The inmates, many of whom were malnourished, were rescued and kept in police custody. The owner and operator of the shrine, Alfa Oloore, as he is fondly called, has been arrested and detained by the police. According to some residents, Alfa Oloore, who claimed to be a spiritualist and a healer, has been operating the shrine for many years with suspicion and dread. They described the shrine as a den of ritualists and kidnappers, where unsuspecting victims were kept for ritual purposes. The state’s Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Gbenga Fadeyi, confirmed the arrest of the operator and evacuation of the inmates. Fadeyi further stated that the truth about whether the shrine is a den for ritualists and kidnappers was yet to be determined until the police conclude investigation into the matter.He said: “Some people came later to the police station to say they were the ones who gave their children to the owner of the shrine, who they claimed to be a spiritualist. In fact, some of those recovered had issues, some behave like drug addicts, some like mentally challenged persons. The police will embark on a thorough investigation into the matter and come up with a report.” Meanwhile, men of a vigilance group in Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni Local Government Area of Rivers State have busted a den of kidnappers and arrested 10 suspected cultists. The arrest was carried out in a forest between Ndele and Rumuji community in Emohua Local Government Area of the state. It was gathered that the suspects were members of a gang group of kidnappers terrorising travellers on the East-West road. The Rumuji community had engaged the services of the vigilance group following the rise in cult and criminal activities in the area. The vigilance group arrived the community on Monday and made the arrests while combing the bushes in the area. A community source who pleaded for anonymity said: “We were under siege for a long time because of hoodlums who were terrorizing the Elele, Ndele and Emohua East-west route, but we feel relieved now. This is what the Rumuji police Rumuji Divisional Headquarters could not achieve. “It’s quite obvious even to the blind that the Nigeria police force has absolutely deserted her law enforcement responsibility(s), and focused more attention on extorting money from innocent road user’s and molesting passengers unnecessarily.” Meanwhile, the chairman of Emohua Local Government Area, Chief Tom Aliezi, has denied promising to place repentant cultists of Ibaa community, in the local council on monthly payment.In a statement by his assistant on Information and Communications, Bright Jossy, the council boss promised to provide financial assistant that will monitor compliance level of the two rival cult groups that laid down their arms in the interest of peace and development. The statement read in parts: “We wish to categorically state that at no point did the council chairman make such promise, as the council chairman cannot pay any one for leaving crime when the people are still suffering from the effect of their crime in the community. The council chairman only declared that the council would make financial provision for members of the committee to function effectively.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
