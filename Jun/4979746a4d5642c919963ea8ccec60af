This makes Nigeria the country with the highest number of Cisco NetAcads in Africa. The celebration took place at a NetAcad Demo and roundtable session at the Federal Science and Technical College, Yaba, Lagos, at the weekend. Founded in 1998, the Cisco Networking Academy is a comprehensive e-learning program that provides an ever-expanding community of students, employers, educators’, NGOs and employees with the requisite technical and entrepreneurial skills required to transform the world for the better. The event and demo session, which had in attendance Francine Katsoudas, Chief People Officer, Cisco and other senior executives of Cisco, provided an opportunity for NetAcad students to demonstrate their trainings so far. Demos showcased included a smart IoT solutions system, the assembling of a computer by students from Queens and Kings College, Lagos. Other interesting demos included a robotics demo by NetAcad students who won the National Robotics Competition as well as a demo from the runner-up of the 2019 Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge, who won a sum of $10,000 for their REALDRIP solution. Commenting at the NetAcad demo and roundtable session, General Manager of Cisco Nigeria and West African Countries, Olakunle Oloruntimehin, said, “At Cisco, we have come to understand that technology is truly powerful when combined with education. We are proud to say that for over 20 years, the Cisco Networking Academy has impacted the lives of over nine million students globally.” Our courses are designed to mold technical talent and hone our students’ skills for innovation in digitization. In partnership with a number of educators and instructors at 200 academies in Nigeria, we are constantly working to deliver the best curricula to help train these students”. The roundtable session ended with an announcement from Cisco on its new, three-year partnership with international advocacy organization, Global Citizen, to power the movement to end extreme poverty. The partnership involves the company’s commitment to funding and technology to help end poverty, playing a vital role in making progress towards the United Nations Global Goals for Sustainable Development and ending extreme poverty by 2030.
