Unit Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Onitsha, Anambra State, Paulinus Akpotobo, and another senior officer have been arrested by the Onitsha Police Area Command for allegedly strangling a colleague, Emeka Ojei, to death. The incident reportedly took place on Thursday evening.Sources close to FRSC said trouble started when the deceased threatened to write a petition of corrupt practice against one of the officers to FRSC zonal headquarters in Benin City, Edo State, an action that did not go down well with the affected officer. The Guardian gathered that as Ojei was about sending the report, the officer he was to indict rushed to him pleading forgiveness. But his plea was said to have fallen on deaf ears. According to our source, the two officers started struggling for the phone with which the deceased wanted to contact the Benin office.We also gathered that as the struggle continued, the unit commander summoned Ojei to his office; but the latter refused to comply. The commander, we learnt, rushed to him and started dragging him to his office with the help of two others. In the process, one of them reportedly held him by the neck and strangled him to death.Confirming the incident, the Onitsha Police Area Commander, John Obuagbaka, said “the commander and one other senior officer are here helping us in our investigation.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
