Manchester United will face two stern oppositions at the start of their 2019/20 Premier League season. The Red Devils begin their campaign against Europa League winners, Chelsea, before travelling to Wolves in the second round of matches. United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has commenced his plans to rebuild the squad. He signed his first new recruit, Daniel James from Swansea to the Old Trafford on Wednesday. The Welsh winger has officially completed a move to Manchester United, putting pen to paper on a five-year contract. Solskjaer will hope that Man Utd will mount a title challenge and at the least finish the season in top four.
