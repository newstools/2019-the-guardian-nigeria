On his reaction to the development, Obasanjo, who commended Mrs. Buhari for speaking out, said: “Apparently, the First Lady has not adopted the bedroom approach to get her husband’s attention to the issues” Besides, the former President, who played host to the editorial members of a social media platform, “Penpushing Media” at his Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) boardroom, stressed that intensive advocacy and sensitisation would raise awareness. A release by media aide, Kehinde Akinyemi, in Abeokuta quoted Obasanjo as saying: “We have to put all things on the table to address these problems. Mind you, we have to be sincere and genuine with ourselves. “It is nice that the President’s wife is talking. I think she did well, and may be she should also have a pillow talk with the President.” Earlier in her speech, Chairman, Editorial Board of Penpushing Media, Mrs. Funke Fadugba, said the visit was to intimate the former President with the programme of events for the third anniversary lecture of the organisation scheduled for July 19. She said that the anniversary lecture with the theme “Political Evolution and Multi-party Democracy: Education to the Rescue” has become imperative in view of the developments in the country.
