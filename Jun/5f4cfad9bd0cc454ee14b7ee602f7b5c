 [File] Ex-Governor Mohammed Abdullahi Abubakar of Bauchi State  Abubakar’s aide, Muktar Jibril, denied that his principal used such amount to purchase woods and shrouds for burial of corpses at the Bauchi Muslims cemetery. Spokesman to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governor, Dr. Ladan Salihu, had on Monday alleged that Abubakar spent N2.3 billion on funerals within five months. Jibril said his principal inherited the practice of purchasing burial materials for the graveyard from his predecessors. His words: “In response to media reports on the issue of mahogany and shrouds procured for burials, we want to state that this is a practice inherited by the government of Abubakar from its predecessors. Considering its significance and impact on the people, especially the bereaved, it decided to continue with it. “However, the project, like any other of same magnitude, was awarded to qualified contractors. Based on available verifiable record, N1,270,743,520 had been expended since its inception and not the exaggerated figure of N2.3 billion mischievously posted on the social media by critics. “We urge the good people of the state to disregard this insinuation and act of desperation by elements of retrogression.” He said every contract awarded was subjected to scrutiny and appraisal by the due process agency, in accordance with public procurement law, contract agreement, payment of tax due on such contracts and other requirements. Noting that the figure posted was calculated to portray the previous government in bad light, he said the story was intended to distract people’s attention from the poor start of the present PDP administration marked by brigandage and affront to the rule of law and basic tenets of democracy.
