 [FILES] Ishaq Akintola  In a statement signed by its Founder and Director, Prof. Ishaq Akintola, the group described Buhari as a hero of the moment and a man who deserves accolades for coming out boldly to do what several regimes lacked the guts to do. He said: “Buhari is a genuine democrat, a patriot nulli secundus and a statesman primus inter pareil. As for May 29, it is good riddance to the bad rubbish that was fraudulently contrived as democracy day.” That date had never truly reflected the spirit of nationalism in this country and it had never been accepted by true democrats and June 12 activists North and South of Nigeria.” MURIC, therefore, charged Nigerians to use this unique opportunity to forget all prejudices and proclaim June 12 as Nigeria’s Democracy Day.
