The Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Makurdi will on June 24, 2019 begin full trial of the case between the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in the just concluded 2019 elections, Emmanuel Jime and his People’s Democratic Party (PDP) counterpart, Governor Samuel Ortom. Chairman of the tribunal, Justice Adebola Olusiyi, who issued the order at the end of pre-hearing at the weekend, said the course was now clear and the stage set for full trial. Olusiyi said there would be strict compliance to the number of days parties are entitled to, adding that there is only one pending motion on notice, which will be taken outside pre-hearing. Similarly, Ortom’s application, which was struck out last week and re-filed, was argued and deferred for ruling at the conclusion of hearing.
