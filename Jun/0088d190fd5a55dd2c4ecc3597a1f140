The Director General of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brig-Gen Shuaibu Ibrahim, has said the scheme would communicate the effective date of payment of the new N30, 000 allowance to corps members. Ibrahim stated this yesterday at a workshop/training on Freedom of Information Act (FoIA) for Desk Officers of the NYSC in Abuja.When asked when the payment of the new allowance for corps members would take off, he said: “They will be communicated accordingly, please.” The DG, who said the workshop was aimed at consolidating on the successes recorded by the scheme regarding the use of the FoIA, added that the scheme had grappled with challenges occasioned by “apparent lack of knowledge of our policies and operations by a section of the public.” He urged Nigerians to familiarise themselves with the NYSC Act, so as to understand better, the operations of the scheme and its role, noting: “Since the enactment of the Freedom of Information Act in 2011, the NYSC has been in the forefront of ensuring total compliance with the provisions of the Act.” NYSC Director of Press and Public Relations, Mrs. Adenike Adeyemi, noted that the scheme had FOI community development service groups for corps members, who assist in sensitising the public on the Act.
