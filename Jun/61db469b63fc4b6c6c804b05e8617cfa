On Thursday former London mayor Boris Johnson, a figurehead of the 2016 Brexit campaign, topped the first round of voting for a new leader of the Conservative party and the country. Johnson, who wants to negotiate better withdrawal terms, has pledged to take Britain out of the EU by an October 31 deadline “deal or no deal” — despite warnings of dire economic consequences if Britain crashes out without an agreement. He secured more than twice the number of votes won by his nearest challengers in Thursday’s ballot by Conservative MPs, the first stage in a contest which will produce a new leader in July. Barnier repeated that Brexit was a “lose-lose” deal for both sides but that Brussels had to respect the result of Britain’s 2016 referendum on EU membership “while limiting the consequences, which are numerous”.
