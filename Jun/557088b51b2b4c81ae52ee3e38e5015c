Twenty-four hours after a container fell off an articulated truck and landed on three cars in Apapa area of Lagos State on Saturday, scores escaped death by the whiskers when a trailer fell yesterday at Iyana Iba along Lagos-Badagry expressway, near the Lagos State University (LASU). Just as the bad road caused the Saturday’s incident at Apapa, yesterday’s incident also occurred at a bad spot on the highway. Eyewitnesses shouted as the trailer with the container got to the bad spot, which also has a heap of refuse by its side. A loud bang followed, which left passerby scampering from the scene. One of the sympathisers at the scene lamented why the government has refused to do something about the bad spot. “This very spot that the trailer fell in with the container is noted for similar incidents in the past. It is worrisome that government would continue to look at a place like this and refuse to do something to stop this hazard. “If it were not to be a rainy period and that the spot is littered with waste soaked in water, emitting strong odour, people would have gathered at the spot and it would have been another tragedy by now. We thank God that it is only the trailer and the container that fell and no life was lost,” she said. Another sympathizer said since the government stopped the Lagos-Badagry expressway 10-lane construction, the road from Mile 2 to Badagry takes almost four hours ply. “Even motorcyclists that are now in business because of the bad road do not find things easy. At some spots between Iyana Iba and Mile 2, their passengers would have to disembark more than twice because they pass through some areas that are terribly bad.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
