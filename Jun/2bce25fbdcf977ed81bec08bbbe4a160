Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University A philanthropist and businessman in Bauchi State, Alhaji Nura Manu Soro, has paid the tuition fees for 121 indigent students at Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATBU) Bauchi. Chairman of the foundation, Alhaji Nura Manu Soro, on Monday while interacting with the beneficiaries who paid him a thank you visit at his residence, explained that 116 out of the beneficiaries are degree students while the remaining five were supported to enroll into masters degree programmes. He added that his foundation has also received 70 applications from students of the Federal Polytechnic, Bauchi. He promised that the gesture would not be restricted to only tertiary institutions in the state but will be extended to all indigent students of the state studying in various schools across the country. Soro who stated that the scholarship being awarded by the foundation is purely for tuition fees noted that it is meant for students that secured admissions into tertiary institutions but cannot pay registration fees. “Both applications, selections and verification will be carried out through a local committee. At the tertiary level, it includes students, religious leaders and a representative from students’ affairs office. Applicants should write the names of their three referees who must be known people in their localities”. He said forms have been distributed to emirs, district heads, local government secretariats and students affairs offices of schools across the state for the less-privileged students.
