 So Fresh drink  Speaking at a press conference held at Ogudu, Lagos, Managing Director of So Fresh, Goke Balogun, said the company was birthed to change eating habits in Nigeria considering the importance of food to well-being. According to him, So Fresh has about nine outlets in physical locations, but having observed the need to diversify, it had included a platform where customers could conveniently make orders from their spaces and have them delivered to them. Balogun said the company works with small-scale farmers across the country as well as third-party wholesalers to deliver farm-fresh products to Nigerians. He added that as the business progresses, the firm aims to achieve a closer relationship with the farmers. “About 30 per cent of our farm products come from farmers and 70 per cent from wholesalers. We want to increase our partnership with farmers so they get the bulk of the revenues from So Fresh,” he said. He assured customers of having fresh foods delivered to them, saying, “just like our name, we ensure that foods orders are freshly done and safe for consumption.” Managing Director of Jumia Foods, Guy Futi, said the partnership would promote growth in sales for the two companies. Having the desire to be the largest online food ordering platform, Futi noted that Jumia Foods had added groceries and supermarket to its list, with pharmacies in view. Chief Operating Officer (COO), So Fresh, Abimbola Balogun, expressed satisfaction over the partnership, saying that it would strengthen and facilitate ease of doing business, which would enhance growth for both brands. “So Fresh is well positioned to enrich our lives through its nutritious meals, ranging from salads to smoothie, which caters for breakfast launch and dinner,” she added.
