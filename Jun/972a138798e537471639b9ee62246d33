A gas explosion has rocked SPAR shopping hall in Port Harcourt, injuring many and causing a major damage to the complex. The Guardian gathered that the blast occurred in one of the restaurants on the second floor of the busy facility near the Government House in the city. The Rivers State Police Command spokesperson, Nnamdi Omoni, confirmed that no life was lost. But the bang, which gutted a part of the building, forced workers and shoppers to scamper for safety. An eyewitness feared that some workers of the eatery that suffered serious injuries might not survive. After the detonation, the management evacuated everyone and shut down the hall.
