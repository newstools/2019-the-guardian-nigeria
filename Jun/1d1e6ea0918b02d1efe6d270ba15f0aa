 George with Olamide  According to the founder of Prince George Entertainment, some of the Nigerian acts on his line-up for Canadian tours include Tiwa Savage, Timaya, Olamide, Zlatan, 9ice, CDQ and Alhaji Wasiu Ayinde aka K1 De Ultimate among others. Speaking on the reception for Nigerian music in Canada, he said, “In April, we hosted a multi-city tour for Wizkid and it went on to record an audience of over 4,000. We hosted the show in several cities such as Toronto, Montreal, Edmonton and Vancouver. People love him irrespective of his collaborations with Drake who is a son of the soil. We had a mixed audience of people from Togolese, Kenyans and Canadians.” Pushing Nigerian talents is no new area of business for the promoter, who has been in the game since 2009. “Showbiz for me started when I co-worked with a friend, who is also a showbiz promoter, Microbell. We packaged concerts in Canada for Wizkid and then, Flavour, Bracket and Timaya back in the days. This was around 2012 thereabout. I have also worked with the likes of Oritsefemi, Korede Bello, Dr. Sid, Ycee, Phyno and Diamond Platnumz,” he revealed. He added, “I have quite a whole lot of music concerts lined up for the rest of the year including Alhaji Wasiu Ayinde aka K1 De Ultimate which I was concluded during my recent visit to Nigeria. Other big concerts coming include Tiwa Savage, Zlatan, 9ice, CDQ and the rest. Of course, Olamide is also coming back this year and the people can’t wait.”
