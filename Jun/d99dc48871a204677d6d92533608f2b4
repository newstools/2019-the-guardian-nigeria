The quest by an Enugu based lawyer Ben Oloko to enforce his fundamental human rights over the seizure of his mobile phones, detention and verbal attacks by officials of Enugu State government suffered a setback Friday as the court dismissed his suit. Oloko was on February 28, last year arrested, detained and his phones seized by the Chief Security Officer attached to the government house, Enugu, for allegedly taking pictures at the Lion Building after a meeting. Although he had argued that there was no order restraining people from taking pictures at Lion Building and petitioned the Chief of Staff to the governor, requesting that his phones be released, his prayers fell on deaf ears. He later sued the state governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, his Chief Security Officer and the Commissioner of Police, Enugu state, demanding a written apology, the release of his seized phones and N200m as general damages for the embarrassment he suffered. Ruling on the matter on Friday, Justice Ibrahim Buba of the Federal High Court, Enugu, stated that the lawyer had no right to take pictures at prohibited places like the government house for security reasons. He disagreed with the lawyer that his fundamental rights were breached with the seizure of his phones and the verbal attacks which he received and awarded N150,000 against him. Oloko, while reacting to the judgment, said the Judge failed to cite any precedence to substantiate the claim that “government house is a prohibited area”, stressing that, there was no law to justify the stand. He said he would appeal the order, adding that his phones have remained in the custody of the state government officials since then.
