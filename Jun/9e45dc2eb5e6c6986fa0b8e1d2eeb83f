Persons living with Albinism (PWAs), have little or no melanin in their skin to protect them from the harmful sun rays. Melanin is the agent of sun protection that naturally gives humans protection from the sun. The darker the skin, the more melanin it produces. The lighter the skin, the less melanin it produces. For most people with albinism, it will be impossible to stay out of the sun completely; so when out during daylight hours, PWAs are expected to be adequately protected from the Ultraviolet rays of the sun. <img class="size-full wp-image-949925 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Albino-twins.-Photo-Noizz-e1560685258550.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="665" /> What is Albinism? Albinism is an inherited condition characterised by a substantially lower rate of melanin production. Melanin is the pigment responsible for the colour of the skin, hair, and eyes. People with albinism often have lighter coloured skin and hair than the other members of their family or ethnic group. Vision problems are common among them. Melanin normally protects the skin from damages from the UV rays; so people with albinism are more sensitive to sun exposure and an increased consistent exposure leads to a high risk of skin cancer in the near future.
