It’s been back-to-back summer blockbusters for Chris Hemsworth but it appears the actor is yearning for some time off. The Thor actor told Australian newspaper the Daily Telegraph that he’s taking a break for the rest of the year. The time off comes after two of his biggest movies yet: the Men in Black reboot (out June 14) and Avengers: Endgame, which opened in late April.

They are still young and they are aware when I leave more than before. I have a press tour, a few endorsements and bits and pieces, but mostly just be home. He continued, “If you went back 10 years and asked me what would be my dream scenario, this is kind of it. I can now sit back, enjoy and appreciate it, and stop chasing [movies].” Hemsworth and wife Elsa Pataky share three kids: 7-year-old daughter India Rose and 5-year-old twin boys Sasha and Trista.
