Lagosians urged to embrace Sanwo-Olu’s traffic reforms Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Lagos chapter, Apostle Alexander Bamgbola, has said commercial commuter buses popularly called Danfo should be banned from Lagos roads, as they constitute nuisance to effective management of traffic in the state. He made this known yesterday at the Vehicle Inspection Service (VIS) and Ministry of Home Affairs Interfaith Safety seminar, organized by Lagos State Computerised Vehicle Inspection Service (LACVIS) to sensitize Lagosians on the need to obey traffic laws. The cleric said: “We do not want to see Danfo on Lagos roads, they are evil. If anyone is arrested for any traffic-related offence, do not call the CAN chairman, secretary or your pastor. If defaulters go to jail one or twice for their traffic offences, they will obey the law.” Permanent Secretary, Lagos Ministry of Transportation, Salaam Taiwo, charged clerics to inform their congregation on the full enforcement of the Lagos traffic laws as members of the public will listen more to clerics than law enforcement agencies. “We want clerics to pacify their members because we will not allow traffic offenders to continue in Lagos. He also charged vehicle owners to visit any of the Computerized Vehicle Inspection Centres with their vehicles for inspection before driving on Lagos roads. “All the 3.1 million vehicles in Lagos must be taken to LACVIS centres for inspection. We have enough facilities to check any kind of vehicles for roadworthiness. This will further reduced road accidents on our roads.” Obayendo Segun, Managing Director, LACVIS, noted that with the improvement of manual vehicle inspection to computerized form, offenders would be punished if car owners fail to comply with traffic laws. Meanwhile, Shittu Morouf, Chief Imam of Epe Division, has appeal to the state government for more time for every Lagosian to be aware of the amended traffic laws before full enforcement. Also, Lagosians have been urged to embrace recent reforms introduced by the state to sanitize the chaotic traffic situation and address poor refuse disposal habits in line with Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s vision for a ‘Greater Lagos Project’. A former commissioner and the Balogun General of Epe, Chief Lanre Razak, who made the call, also welcomed the governor’s executive order declaring a state of emergency on traffic congestion and environmental sanitation issues. Razak in a statement in Ikeja said: “I want to commend the operation zero tolerance to indiscriminate waste disposal and traffic offences introduced by Governor Sanwo-Olu but I strongly appeal to Lagosians to give the state government maximum cooperation in its determination to ensure free flow of vehicular traffic on Lagos roads and achieve a cleaner environment.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
