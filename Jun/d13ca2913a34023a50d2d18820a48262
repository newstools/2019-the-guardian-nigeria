Elton John and the makers of his biopic Rocketman have slammed Russian censors for cutting the film’s gay sex scenes. Directed by Dexter Fletcher (Eddie the Eagle, Sunshine on Leith), Rocketman stars Taron Egerton as Elton John and chronicles the iconic musician’s life from boyhood through to his early 40s.

News of the cuts was initially reported by Russian journalists who attended a screening of the film in Moscow. The Guardian later reported that around five minutes of footage had been cut from film because of Russian laws that ban “homosexual propaganda”. Responding to the news, Elton John and the makers of Rocketman issued a statement: “We reject in the strongest possible terms the decision to pander to local laws and censor ‘Rocketman’ for the Russian market, a move we were unaware of until today.

We believe in building bridges and open dialogue, and will continue to push for the breaking down of barriers until all people are heard equally across the world.” Meanwhile, Paramount issued a separate statement in support of Rocketman but emphasized that the studio must respect local laws that might result in certain scenes being cut:
