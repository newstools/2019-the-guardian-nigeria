The platform here also seek to address the issue of awkwardness around it so we telling the guys that whether you have a girlfriend or a sister there is nothing big about having menstruation, it is normal so the government should speed up policies that has to do with Menstrual hygiene in order to create awareness about the issue both at local, national and global level.” Speaking about the imperative of the programme on the lives of Students, the Public Relations Officer (PRO), Student Union government (SUG) of UNIABUJA, Comrade Ozioma Collins said the programme will go a long extent to re orienting Students on the benefits of actually doing things in the right way.
