On Thursday, a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Theresa May said that Britain and Russia “can only have a different relationship if Russia changes its behaviour.” The spokeswoman brought up the 2018 poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Britain, which London blames on Moscow, calling this a “despicable act”. Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier Thursday that it was time to “turn the page” on the countries’ difficult relationship after the spy scandal.
