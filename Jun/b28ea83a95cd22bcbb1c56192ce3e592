Fittingly, the competition will kick off with a game between Enyimba and the current in form team, Enugu Rangers at the Agege Stadium, Lagos. During the regular season, Enyimba and Rangers won their respective home games, as they pursued qualification for the Super Six and so today’s game will determine the better side this season. Speaking on the game, Enyimba’s Ifeanyi Anaemena sees a tough encounter at the arena known as Soccer Temple. “It is going to be a tough game considering the pedigree of the two teams in the NPFL and an Oriental Derby is always a match where the two teams want to win for pride,” Anaemena said. Enyimba had the best defensive record in the regular season, letting in just 13 goals in 22 matches, but Rangers are coming into the game with a record of 40 points, the highest won by any team during the period. The second game of the day will pit FC IfeanyiUbah against Lobi Stars, a team that represented Nigeria at the CAF Champions League this season. Lobi Stars lost their coach, Solomon Ogbeide just before the end of the regular season, but the Makurdi boys say they have put the setback behind them. The third game will see Kano Pillars battling with an Akwa United side desirous of winning a trophy this season. Akwa United topped Group B of the abridged season with Kano Pillars one of their victims in the process. They won 3-0 in Uyo and drew 1-1 in Kano. So, this game will either confirm Akwa United’s superiority or hand Pillars the right to the last laugh. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
