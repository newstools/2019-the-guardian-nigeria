The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) has denied recent reports that it allegedly threatened to attack the South East governors over their ‘stubbornness’. Social media platforms had been awash with the purported threat by the leadership of the group, who reportedly stated in Abuja that the “South East will boil any moment from now” on account of the stubbornness of the zone’s governors. But briefing newsmen after prayers at the Eid-El-Fitri celebration for Moslems in Awka, Anambra State yesterday, the South East Zonal Chairman of the group, Gidado Sidikki, said the reports attributed to him that the South East Zone would be attacked by herders, were false and should be disregarded. His words: “A few days ago, we woke up to a malicious publication in a social media platform in Abuja titled: South East will Boil Any Moment From Now Because of Their Stubbornness, ascribed to the leadership of MACBAN and erroneously attributed to me.” He stressed that the publication was mischievous and a lie that should be disregarded by all segments of the Nigerian society. Meanwhile, the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has said the killings in the North have no direct links with religion and urged all Nigerians to continue to work together to sustain the country’s unity and progress, despite the challenges confronting it. The group, in its Sallah message to mark the end Ramadan fasting, urged Nigerians to continue to pray, worship and work for Nigeria’s unity, peaceful coexistence and harmony. In the statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Ibrahim Mohammad Biu, it noted: “The killings and kidnappings by insurgents, armed bandits, clashes between herdsmen and farmers, as well as cult and militia groups in parts of the North and Nigeria are inconsistent with the tenets of all religions.” While commending security agencies for their efforts in combatting the evils, it urged them to redouble their efforts in preventing crimes, which have continued to ravage the country.
