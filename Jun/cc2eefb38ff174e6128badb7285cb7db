Rob Kardashian’s Instagram ban is still in full effect even though his mom and sister – Kris and Kourtney – promoted an account bearing his name. Instagram users went into a frenzy on Tuesday when his mom and sister told people to follow @robkardashianofficial, but, Rob isn’t allowed to be the person behind the account. ‘@robkardashianofficial is an official fan account being run by “Jenner Communications,” and there are certain rules and guidelines in place to ensure Rob can’t turn it into his own account’, TMZ reports.

In case you are wondering why this is so, Rob Kardashian got booted from the social media platform in 2017 after posting nudes of his ex, Blac Chyna, forcing him to take his social media game to Twitter and Snapchat. The fan account’s first post was on July 5, 2018, but it sat dormant until this past May and now it’s getting more active. Instagram sources say Rob is still very much BANNED and there are no plans to lift the ban any time soon.
