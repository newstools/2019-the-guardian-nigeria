On the difficulty the Eagles faced against Guinea on Wednesday, Rohr said: “Starting the game at 4:30 p.m. was difficult for the players; it was hot and not easy. I want to say congratulations to all the players of both teams, because they did well in the game.
 
“We started slowly because we knew Guinea has a good team, good organisation. We changed five starting players and the spirit was the same. It was not easy to prepare for the match because today (Wednesday) was a special day.
 
“But finally, my players showed they are professionals and in the second half, with passion they showed they could make a difference,” he said,  adding that he was happy for the goal scored by Omeruo through the corner kick.
 
“We have been trying the corner kick situation during our training sessions in camp and I am happy that we scored through the corner kick. I am very satisfied with the five players who started the game as the spirit was the same. It is good to know that we have qualified even with our next game against Madagascar. But we will play to win our game and I am happy there is no injury in my team.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
