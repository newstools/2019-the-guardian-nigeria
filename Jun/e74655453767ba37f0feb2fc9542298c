As Babajide Sanwo-Olu settles into the task of governing Lagos State, he has his job already cut out for him. And to set a template, he has without delay signed an executive order on refuse, traffic management and potholes. Aside the uncompleted projects of his predecessors, Babatunde Fashola and Akinwunmi Ambode, there are virgin projects begging for his attention. Among them are the decrepit roads and streets that litter Ijegun area of the state. The posh buildings and cars dotting its many estates are evidence that many well-to-do individuals have started finding abode in the community inspite of the gnarling traffic snarl on the Mushin/Isolo/Ikotun road axis. For many years, Ijegun roads have been in parlous state. The situation gets worse as more people relocate to the low-cost residential area. On why the roads have remained in bad shape for long, it has been a trade of blames. While residents blame greedy landlords, commercial transporters blame the local council, and landlords blame the state government for the neglect. A landlord who has a property at Irepodun Street, off Community Road, told The Guardian that their plight had on several occasions been forwarded to former governors Fashola and Ambode with no positive response till date. “Early this year, the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, Ambode and Sanwo-Olu were in Ijegun to campaign and share TraderMoni, they of course saw some of these bad roads, but nothing has been done about it,” he said Two major roads in the area – Community Road and Lafunke Street – gateway into the area from Igando represent the neglect Ijegun is suffering. A motorcyclist that operates in the area, Edwin Ikechukwu, told The Guardian that the roads had been in the sorry state for over three decades. “It has been like this for over 30 years. Ambode has been here. He promised to fix the roads, we saw nothing until he left office.” Another motorcyclist, Christian Okereafor, said the roads would remain in such state because “in Alausa records, this road had been rehabilitated.” Noting that government officials come to the area regularly to collect revenue, he pleaded with Sanwo-Olu to come to their aid. “If it rains, our business will be grounded or we are forced to increase fare up to 100 per cent.” Others, who pleaded anonymity, accused landlords of contributing to the problem.
