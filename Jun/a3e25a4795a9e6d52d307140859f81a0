Kachala said that the three suicide bombers,  comprising two females and a male,  detonated the IEDs in a local tea joint and film center in the community. He said that about 17 persons died instantly, adding that the death toll increased to 30 on Monday as a result of lack of immediate medical attention. He said that his staff could not reach the spot of the incident as the military had closed the road to traffic and  the hospital in Konduga did not have enough facilities to handle the situation. “When me and my team arrived Konduga early this morning, the military prevented us from gaining access to the community to assist the victims. “They told us they were given order from above not to open the road untill 9am,”he lamented.
