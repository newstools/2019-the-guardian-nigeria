Simi has officially launched her own music company, Studio Brat. Barely months after announcing that her contract with record label X3M Music would not be renewed, the music star Simi left many anticipating her next move; at least now we know. Simi shared the exciting news in a statement to her fans saying: The norm is to do a formal and proper press release, with big, impersonal words – but this is me and you. We started with true laughs, constructive criticism, silly jokes and personal moments. We’re gonna keep it that way. All I’ve ever wanted was to live my dreams – to do it on my terms, but for you. Each step I’ve taken has brought me here. This is only the beginning of the best part of my journey. I hope that you stand with me, fight with me, love with me and grow with me. My team and I have continuously put our hearts into it. Like Michael Jackson said, “Don’t stop till you get enough…” We never want to let you down. Proof: I’m using a Michael Jackson quote. So, with a heart full of excitement, I introduce Studio Brat to you. It’s Ours. Let’s do what we do!
