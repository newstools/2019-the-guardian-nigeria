Wendy Williams is not in a corner crying over split milk as she seems to have moved on with her life since her split from estranged husband, Kevin Hunter. 54-year-old Williams flaunted what many have now assumed to be the new man in her life after she took to Instagram today to share a photo of herself holding hands with a mystery guy, whose face was not shown while relaxing near a swimming pool. The “Wendy Williams Show” host who is currently in the midst of a divorce captioned the photo, “Last night was the most beautiful sunset in Sherman Oaks with special people. Thank you, California! You’ve won me over!” the New Jersey native captioned her post. “I’ll be back for the Hip Hop Festival in August! #92.3 #oldenoughtobeyourmother #verysexyman #mynewlife.” Wendy Williams and mystery man | Photo – Instagram Her caption for the photo has since generated a debate as fans try to guess whether the mystery man is an older or younger man. This photo debate is coming nearly a month after she shut down rumors that she has a boyfriend, telling viewers that the “handsome” man with whom she was spotted on May 11 was just a member of her security team. She had reacted to the reports of a new man in her life saying, “You don’t just throw away 25 years lock, stock and barrel,” she said on the May 14 episode of her syndicated talk show, referencing her split from Hunter. “I don’t have a boyfriend but I must admit I am rediscovering my love of men. … I do date. I date pretty often.” It would be recalled that Williams who shares a son with 46-year-old Hunter filed for divorce on April 10 after 21 years of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences. The news of Williams’ filing came a few weeks after Hunter’s alleged mistress, Sharina Hudson, gave birth to a baby girl.
