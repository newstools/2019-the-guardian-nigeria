The singer and pianist debut song ‘Yoruba Demon,’ offers an introspective blend of Soul, Hip-Hop, and Afro pop. Nearly three years since his last EP album, the Delta state contemporary artiste returns with “Yoruba Demon,” a collaboration with Problem Solved that serves as a sequel to the 2016’s classic movie “Merry Men: The Real Yoruba Demon.” Over the rumbling beat, the “Suzanna” hitmaker spit-bars in his signature flows. “I dun wake up in a rollie life dun tush up, met the genie in the bottom when I ook off,” he raps. “Make me drink for that cup / make I no go fuck up / there’s a demon in my head pour me two shots.” Along with the song, Glenn Mena has been teasing the release of his upcoming EP album – The Mask & Music EP Project Cut Two. Additionally, Glenn Mena latest single talks about the uncanny gift of young men who effortlessly make ladies fall in love with them with their smooth-talking skills, appearance, opulence and lifestyle.  – https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Mena
