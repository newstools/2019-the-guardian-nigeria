The 29-year-old Ruiz started the fight as a massive 32-1 underdog but floored Joshua four times on his way to a win which upended the heavyweight division. While Hearn has indicated the rematch is likely to take place in Britain, where Joshua regularly sells out large-capacity venues, some reports have indicated it may yet take place in Las Vegas or Los Angeles. “If AJ bounces back and defeats Ruiz in a rematch, he’s a bigger star than he was prior to [Saturday] night,” Hearn said. “The rematch is so important to his career, we went to Ruiz’s country so I expect the next one to take place in the UK,” he added. Joshua meanwhile has dismissed suggestions he may require a warm-up fight to prepare himself for a Ruiz rematch. “What’s a warm-up fight?” he told British reporters after Saturday’s defeat. “I’m down to scrap. No warm-up. That’d be stupid. No way.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
