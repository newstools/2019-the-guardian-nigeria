Office of Nigeria president Monday evening distanced itself from reports that President Buhari approved the implementation of state and local government policing across the federation. Presidential spokesman Gerba Shehu refuted the reports in a statement. “Until a white paper is produced, it will be premature and pre-emptive to suggest that the recommendations contained in the report have been approved by the President in part or whole,” Shehu said. Buhari received a report on the reform of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). Shehu disclosed that the President requested that the report be studied and a white paper produced within three months. He explained that “President Buhari’s specific directive is that a three-man panel be set up to produce the white paper.” The presidential spokesman noted that the report of the committee will form the basis of recommendation on setting up of state and local government police in Nigeria.
