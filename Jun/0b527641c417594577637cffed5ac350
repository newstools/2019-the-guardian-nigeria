Richest female musician, Rihanna is having a swell time and deservedly so as the pop sensation went day drinking with the “Late Night” host, Seth Meyers. Meyers who was clearly excited used the opportunity to introduce the Barbadian beauty to some of his signature cocktails, before serenading her with one of her own songs. He kicked off the fan-favourite segment by downing a shot and a full beer in one gulp before introducing his guest. Then, as Rihanna started chugging her own beer, he told her, “You don’t have to do that.” And while she didn’t drink nearly as much as the “Late Night” host did for this segment, the singer did hold her own against him and even took on some of his most horrific concoctions inspired by her music. Meyers was giddy behind the bar as he introduced her to drinks like Under My Rumbrella, We Found Vueve In a Hostess Place, and Bitch Better Have My Bunny. And if you thought champagne and Hostess Twinkies were an odd mix, you’re not alone. They filled their afternoon with a drinking game where Rihanna had to try and identify where she wore some of her most iconic fashion looks, and Seth really thought he had her with the last one. Later, the duo took turns offering sage bartender advice to one another with Meyers suggesting a counter career for Rihanna should she ever give up music and all of her other business ventures. Watch the video below:  It would be recalled that Forbes recently named Rihanna the richest female musician with an estimated net worth of $600 million.
