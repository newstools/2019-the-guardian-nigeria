Leo Ogor The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Caucus in the House of Representatives has urged its members to vote for speaker of their choice among the All Progressives Congress (APC) contenders. Its leader, Leo Ogor, in a statement, said the members could proceed to the meetings, campaigns, strategy sessions and other activities of any speakership aspirant of their preference. Expressing concern over the conduct of some of its members in the pursuit of their narrow interests, the caucus explained that it arrived at the decision for the benefit of the nation. It noted: “While the PDP House Caucus has taken the decision with clear focus on the national interest as well as the future strategic goals of our party, we are not unaware that a few may unfortunately feel inclined to go overboard, nibbling dangerously at carrots dangled before them without adequately heeding appropriate guidelines.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
