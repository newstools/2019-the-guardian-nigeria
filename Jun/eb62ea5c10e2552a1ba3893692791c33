Aside’s being one of rap’s most lyrical MCs, Nas is advancing into the children’s book business. Last week, the Queens rapper announced plans to release his first book for children titled I Know I Can, a homage to the 2002 God’s Son cut “I Know.” “@MassAppeal launches @MAJRour kids brand. My first kid’s book is on the way,” he wrote on Instagram. The post was accompanied by the book’s cover, which has the back view of a black family of four walking toward a life-size cutout of a globe. “Our mission is to inspire future generations through the creation of unique toys, apparel, and innovative learning tools,” reads the company’s mission statement. “MAJR is here to reflect the diverse hues of both the modern family and popular culture because education starts in the crib.” His first book will be part of a reading series that is geared to “empowering kids to be whatever they want to be when they grow up.” Nas will be busy this summer as he kicks off his co-headlining tour with Mary J. Blige on July 11 in Florida. There is no release date for I Know I Can just yet.   @MassAppeal launches @MAJR our kids brand. My first kids book is on the way.
