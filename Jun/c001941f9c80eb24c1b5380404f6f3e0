 [FILES] information and communications technology (ICT)  “One of such projects is the National Identity Management System (NIMS) project. NCS notes that the number of enrolments into the NIMS has accelerated as a result of a number of regulatory innovations introduced by the current administration such as the integration of the National Identity Number (NIN) into the issuance and renewal of International Passports by the Nigeria Immigration Service. Such regulatory innovations will definitely result in economic growth.
 
“It is in the light of the foregoing, NCS highlights the plight of one of our corporate members, Chams Plc (and Chams Consortium Ltd., (CCL)), a forefront operator of the National Identity Management System Concession (the Concession), which commenced officially in the year 2010. It is on record that Chams made huge investments, in excess of N9 billion into the concession.
  
“Chams however, suffered many frustrations which eventually snowballed into an unresolved state of affairs. This is despite the fact that Chams Plc has submitted to an amicable resolution in furtherance of her faith in the present administration. NCS calls for urgent and decisive intervention to salvage Chams Plc’s position and allow Chams Plc and Chams Consortium Ltd reap the fruits of an amicable resolution freely entered into with the NIMC.”
   
Aderounmu urged that NIMC stand by and enforce the Terms of the Mediation Agreement of December 19th, 2017, to enable Chams Plc execute assigned business opportunities under the NIMS project, and hence regain stability towards restoring its share valuation, which has suffered massive erosion consequence of the plight on the NIMC project.
