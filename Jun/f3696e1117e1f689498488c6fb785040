Klopp’s first Champions League title was met with widespread celebration in the German sports media. On Monday, Kicker magazine carried the headline “King Klopp” on its front page, and described the Liverpool manager as “the face of German football”. Beckenbauer echoed those sentiments in an interview with Bild, calling Klopp “one of the best coaches in the world”. “Juergen brought a new type of football to Germany… what he began in Dortmund, he has refined in Liverpool.” Liverpool is reportedly looking to extend Klopp’s contract, which currently runs until 2022. Yet Beckenbauer questioned whether 51-year-old would stay on Merseyside in the long term. “I think that a job in England robs you of energy. As a manager in the Premier League, you have more responsibility than as a coach in the Bundesliga,” he told Bild. “With the two cup competitions and the slightly larger league, the amount of games is considerably higher than it is in Germany.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
