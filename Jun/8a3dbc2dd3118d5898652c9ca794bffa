 PHOTO: FIFA.com  Okumagba led his group to France with the aim of cheering the Falcons in every match they featured in the World Cup. But things have not worked out for the Supporters Club members, as they have been prevented from singing and beating drums for the players. Okumagba told The Guardian that they have not been treated fairly by French security officers deployed to the stadia. “It was so bad that the security stopped us from entering the stadium with our trumpets,” Okumagba said. “Even our trumpeters who came from Germany were not allowed into the venue with their instruments. That may have affected the morale of our girls, particularly in their first match against Norway. “And it was not the best way to go because the World Cup is not about kicking the ball inside the pitch alone. FIFA also recognizes the role played by the supporters of the various teams. We did everything possible by sourcing for the funds for our members to be with the team in France, only for the security to prevent us from blowing our trumpet. We have made former complain to FIFA about it,” he stated. Okumagba hinted that their attention has shifted to Egypt for the 2019 AFCON. “We are now preparing for Egypt to give the Super Eagles the support they will need to top their group and make it to the final. I am sure the Eagles have what it takes to win the Nations Cup, and we will give the support.” It was not clear the number of supporters Okumagba is preparing for the trip to Egypt, but a source close to the club told The Guardian yesterday that they may storm Egypt with over 600 members.
