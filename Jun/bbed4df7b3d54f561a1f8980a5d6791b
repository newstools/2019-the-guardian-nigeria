Coach Gernot Rohr has to shuffle his side with some of the players battling with a bout of sickness. The coach confirmed that Samuel Kalu who collapsed during training due to dehydration was 100% fit and could feature in the game against Guinea. “The very good news is that Kalu did again yesterday in Cairo an MRI and it is now 100% sure that he is fit and he will be available for the game,” he said in the pre-match press conference “He already started training with the team so we are happy about that because everybody was a little bit scared when this happened.” Odion Ighalo could be in line for a start in place of Paul Onuachu after he came on to score in the 77th minute against Burundi. Right back, Shehu Abdullahi will miss out of the fixture due to a hamstring injury that he had in the game against the Swallows of Burundi. Guinea hopes to get their qualification back on track after the surprising draw to Madagascar. Liverpool midfielder, Naby Keita is expected to start from the get-go after playing only 28 minutes in Guinea’s first fixture.
