The social media sphere was agog last week with news of popular relationship blogger, Blessing Okoro claiming ownership of a house that isn’t hers leading to her arrest by the owner, Onye Eze. In a development, Okoro has issued an official apology. She wrote, “Hey lovers, I know it has been crazy lately and I am sincerely sorry. I take responsibility for everything. I hate that I had to put my friends and everyone else who looked up to me in this position. Like everyone else I had goals set up for the year and one of them was to finish my house before my 30th birthday and it was a resolution I had laid out in public but because of certain reasons I couldn’t meet up the deadline and that put me under mental pressure for success. I was impatient which led to beating myself too hard and I could have done better. I AM REALLY SORRY I LET YOU ALL DOWN. I know better now. I know not to go ahead of my victory and have small wins celebration. Here is to everyone under any sort of pressure. I had to experience a major meltdown to learn that patience is a virtue. It is only going to take a little time but the lines will eventually fall in pleasant places. And for the incessant calls and text messages from my loved ones that were terrified seeing me on cuffs I was never arrested or detained and no police officers were associated with the act. It was their best form of proving a point. But I am grateful to everyone who stood by me, I hope you still find a place in your heart to forgive, love me and accept me as the crazy happy girl you have always loved. Thanks for not giving up on me entirely.” It would be recalled that Okoro had first insisted that she owned the building in controversy when it first surfaced that she had lied about its ownership.
