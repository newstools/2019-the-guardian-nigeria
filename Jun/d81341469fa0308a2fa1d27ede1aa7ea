The fifth edition of Opeifa Handball Championship also known as the Opeifa Cup organised for the Lagos State Secondary School boys and girls would hold between June 17 and 21 at the Mobolaji Johnson Sports Centre, Rowe Park, Yaba. The competition sponsored by Comrade Kayode Opeifa, is one of the grassroots development programmes organised by the State Handball Association to discover and nurture talents. Secretary of the association, Bintu Ojikutu expressed happiness over the collaboration, while assuring that this year’s edition would exceed the previous ones.“I must say that the Lagos State Handball Association is ready for this year’s Opeifa Cup. As usual, schools across the state will showcase their talents in the championship and the state coaches will have the opportunity to scout for talented players that will be of benefit to the state in the nearest future. “Not less than 103 teams took part in the 2018 edition and this year it is expected to be more. But the organisers wish to raise the standard of the game to ensure that the very best participate at all times,” Ojikutu added. It will be recalled that Zumratul Senior Secondary School emerged winners in the senior boys’ category, while Wesley Senior Girls triumphed in the girls’ cadre of the championship. Eletu Odibo topped the girls’ junior category, while Herbert Macaulay School won the boy’s junior category last year.
