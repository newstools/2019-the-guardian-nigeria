Hollywood power couple Jada Pinkett and Will Smith have been relatively open about their personal lives and the high and lows of their 22 year marriage. On next week’s episode of The Red Table Talk series, she will dive into the topic of infidelity and touch on the “betrayals” that have affected her and Will’s relationship. The episode will feature the actress’ mother, Adrienne Banfield-Norris, and renowned couple’s therapist Esther Perel. “What are the alternatives to divorce?” Jada asks Perel in a sneak peek. “Everybody thinks as soon as you find out there’s been an affair you have to get a divorce.” Perel responds: “I’m not of that persuasion because I think there are many relational betrayals. Contempt, neglect, and violence and indifference and nobody tells people, ‘Leave, leave, get the hell out.’ And especially on women, it’s the real new pressure. God forbid you still love the person who actually cheated on you. Maybe that person is a lot of things and cheated on you. It’s like the shame of staying, now that you can go you’ve got to get out.” Jada then addresses a question that she gets asked a little too often; Has an affair ever affected her and Will’s marriage? “I’m asked a lot about, ‘Is there infidelity in your relationship with Will?’” the actress says. “And it’s like, ‘No, but there have been other betrayals of the heart that have been far bigger than I could even think in regards to an infidelity situation.” The full episode will be available this Monday on Facebook Watch.
