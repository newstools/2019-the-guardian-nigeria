Doctors at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), have recommended a second stage limb elongation surgery with ilizarov device for 19-year old Omowunmi Dorcas Adeyanju, at a procedure estimated cost of N308, 000. Omowunmi was involved in a motorcycle accident three years ago. According to the Medical Report signed by the Consultant Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgeon, Dr. M.O. Kayode, Omowunmi visited the facility with swelling, deformity and open wound on the right leg three years ago. “She was treated by a traditional bone setter, prior to her presentation at the centre. The wound failed to heal and there was an exposed bone. Plain radiograph showed grossly comminuted fracture in the middle of the right tibia with sequestra and multiple areas of rarefaction…” the report said. Omowunmi, a native of Oyo State, was diagnosed with a mismanaged open fracture and infected gap nonunion complicated by chronic osteomyelitis. She was planned for surgery in two stages and had her first stage sequestrectomy and bone transport surgery in October 2017. She now has a residual limb length discrepancy, which is to be addressed at the second stage of surgery. Her mother, Mrs. Adefunke Adeyanju, said the first surgery was made possible by the help of well-meaning Nigerians and the family. She is, again, appealing to the public to assist her daughter to carry out the second stage surgery. Her account details are Adeyanju Adefunke Nike, Sterling Bank account number 0060409551.
