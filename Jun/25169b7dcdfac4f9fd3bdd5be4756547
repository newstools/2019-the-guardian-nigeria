In the wake of the rape protests going on at the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA) branches, a pro-Biodun Fatoyinbo protester has revealed that he was paid N10,000 to protest in support of the embattled pastor. A protester, obviously not a member of the church, said each person was paid N10, 000 to support the pastor. Busola Dakolo, a former chorister in the church alleged that she was raped by the senior pastor, Biodun Fatoyinbo when she was 17. In reaction to this, the pastor issued a statement insisting that even as an unbeliever, he never raped anyone and promised to take her to court. It should be recalled that in 2013, Ese Walters, a former member of the church accused Fatoyinbo of sexual assault, a case he promised to give a “robust response” but he is yet to do so. Unlike Walters’s scenario, Busola Dakolo’s revelation birthed a massive outcry against the pastor so much that he had to respond late on Friday. Expectedly, many Nigerians on social media have condemned the alleged hiring of a crowd to support the pastor. This is disgraceful…church hired placards. Fatoyinbo’s minions. pic.twitter.com/kB7CY0RVPq — Tamunodenyefa (@prayziz) June 30, 2019      Meanwhile,  Fatoyinbo has charged their members not to speak or come against the protesters but act in a Christ-like manner while disclosing that their annual 7 Days of Glory programme has been cancelled.
