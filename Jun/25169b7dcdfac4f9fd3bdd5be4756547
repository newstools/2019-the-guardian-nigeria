In the wake of the rape protests going on at the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA) branches, a pro-Biodun Fatoyinbo protester¬†has revealed that he was paid N10,000 to protest in support of the embattled pastor. A¬†protester, obviously not a member of the church, said each person was paid¬†N10, 000 to support the pastor. Busola Dakolo, a former chorister in the church alleged that she was raped by the senior pastor, Biodun Fatoyinbo when she was 17. In reaction to this, the pastor issued a statement insisting that even as an unbeliever, he never raped anyone and promised to take her to court. It should be recalled that in 2013, Ese Walters, a former member of the church accused Fatoyinbo of sexual assault, a case he promised to give a ‚Äúrobust response‚Äù but¬†he is yet to do so. Unlike Walters‚Äôs scenario, Busola Dakolo‚Äôs revelation birthed a massive outcry against the pastor so much that he had to respond late on Friday. Expectedly, many Nigerians on social media have condemned the alleged hiring of a crowd to support the pastor. This is disgraceful‚Ä¶church hired placards. Fatoyinbo‚Äôs minions. pic.twitter.com/kB7CY0RVPq ‚Äî Tamunodenyefa (@prayziz) June 30, 2019  Pro-#COZA protester in Abuja confesses that he was given N10,000 by the church to march in solidarity for #biodunfatoyinbo #ChurchToo #PastorStepDown pic.twitter.com/P9DjIZE216 ‚Äî Legit.ng (@legitngnews) June 30, 2019  COZA, if y'all are gonna hire paid protesters to defend Pastor Biodun, at least hire the literate ones naa.Don't embarrass yourselves.
