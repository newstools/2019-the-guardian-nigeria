Drake recently hinted he could be launching into the next era of music based on his Instagram activity. Following his clapback at Pusha T on “Duppy Freestyle – “Don’t push me when I’m in album mode” – Drake posted a series of photos recapping his recent travels with most captioned “Album mode.” All of the photos, shot by Jamil GS, find the 6 God decompressing with his crew on a tropical vacation in the Turks and Caicos Islands. The shots range from Drake playing golf in a du-rag, on the tennis court, by the ocean, and enjoying a couple of spritzers in the pool. Drake kept a pretty low profile post-Scorpion for the first half of 2019 in music until the Raptors took home their first NBA championship, which prompted Drizzy to deliver the two-song Best in the World Pack over the weekend. The OVO rapper seems re-energized to get back in the booth and continue writing the next chapter of his decorated career. Check out his series of “album mode” posts to IG below.   Album Mode.
