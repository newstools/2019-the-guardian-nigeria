Sir: My birthday is closer than I ever imagined and I’m surprised that I will be celebrating  another year soon. This is shocking and coming earlier than I thought. I am yet to buy a singlet for myself or put enough money in my piggy bank to buy coke for my friends. But there is one thing I think I need more than cake or birthday wishes on Facebook and Twitter. I recently joined Instagram after I quitted Badoo. The reason why I left Badoo is so obvious to reasonable person. That platform clashed with my spiritual life and I think I just have to be closer to God, as you know, each day is a step closer to the grave and I don’t want to be caught on Badoo. So, the gift I want for my birthday this year is either a pistol or AK-47 and I don’t want this gift from anyone but from the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Abubakar Adamu because that is the only source I can really trust. But if I can’t get it from him, I will relocate to Europe or go through Sahara Desert to Jamaica. I learnt life is better over there, unlike South Africa where the life I’m trying to protect will be stolen through xenophobic attack or US where the police can shoot me because I’m black, no one will want to kill me in Jamaica for trying to take the citizens’ job. I love Jamaica as an upper/middle-income country, which key strengths include its political stability, abundant natural resources, a well-educated workforce and close ties with the United States, the European Union and fellow members of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). Sincerely, the rate of attack on Nigerians by these faceless and protected Fulani herdsmen and Boko Haram will definitely crash if every reasonable persons has access to gun. The vast majority of gun owners say that having a gun makes them feel safer. And far more today than in 1999, they cite protection rather than hunting or other activities– as the main reason they own guns. A national survey finds that nearly half of gun owners (48 per cent) volunteer that the main reason they own a gun is for protection; just 32 per cent say they have a gun primarily for hunting and even fewer cite other reasons, such as target shooting. In 1999, 49 per cent said they owned a gun mostly for hunting, while just 26 per cent cited protection as the biggest factor. But I’m afraid that the IGP may not be kind enough to do me this favour, remember, President Muhammed Buhari gave an executive order on withdrawal of licences for guns of Nigerians, which human rights activist, Chief Mike Ozekhome stated that the action was borne out of the president’s aimed at curtailing the self determination aspiration of IPOB even as he noted that it exposes innocent Nigerians to the murderous activities of herdsmen, kidnappers and Boko Haram terrorists. While Ezekhome was said to be 89.8 per cent right by some Nigerians, I don’t think our incorruptible president may have such intention. He is a democrat and he will always settle everything through dialogue which, democracy is known for. But I am also afraid that the IGP himself may not be aware that crime rate has increased since he said recently that crime rate in the country has declined even as he noted that the last few weeks have witnessed new patterns and threats of criminality that has necessitated a review of strategy. Unlike Idris who was sent to Benue but stayed put in Nasarawa to do whatever, I think Idris may also be misinformed about the true picture of things. I am not advocating for the right for citizens to own a gun. All I’m saying is for the government to review its obsolete strategy. The government is showing no sign it could protect the citizens.
