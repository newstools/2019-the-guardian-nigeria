From 8th to 9th of June 2019, Style House Files in partnership with ITC SheTrades, will host X Retail: SheTrades Edition. X-Retail: SheTrades Edition, which is sponsored by the UK Department for International Development (DFID) under the SheTrades Commonwealth project, aims at empowering women-owned businesses across the Commonwealth. Since its inception, the X Retail platform has focused on facilitating commerce, and creating access to market opportunities for fashion entrepreneurs to enable their businesses to generate sales; this is key to their sustainability and the industry’s ability to positively impact the economic landscape. X Retail, which in the past has been on the line-up of the Lagos Fashion Week showcase in October, will for the first time, host a stand-alone event. X Retail: She Trades Edition “Creating avenues for commerce is central to the SHF agenda. It was important we gave X Retail a stand-alone event that is truly reflective of the growth the platform has undergone over the years, as well as provide shoppers with more variety and tailored shopping experience” commented Omoyemi Akerele, Founder Style House Files & Lagos Fashion Week. In preparation for X Retail, ITC SheTrades in partnership with UPS will be coordinating workshops on the 6th and 7th of June 2019, targeting women entrepreneurs within the ITC SheTrades network. The aim of these workshops is to further equip women-owned businesses with new skills to grow their various businesses and the tools for wealth creation. Following the completion of the workshops, will be X Retail on 8th and 9th of June, 2019. From 11 AM to 9 PM daily, Balmoral at Federal Palace, VI will be the destination for a shopping experience with over 30 brands. The consumer-focused experience will showcase a wide array of female-owned businesses in textiles & apparel and shea beauty brands.
