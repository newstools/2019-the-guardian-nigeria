 Chevron  Other projects in the portfolio include 10 model classroom blocks and nine mother-and-child care centres. This was revealed by the General Manager, Policy, Government and Public Affairs of Chevron, Esimaje Brikinn, while briefing participants of the Advanced Writing and Reporting Skills (AWARES) programme at the Pan Atlantic University, Ibeju-Lekki, Lagos. Brikinn said Chevron’s Deep Water (DW) social investment portfolio hit over N21 billion benefitting over 400 communities and 600,000 Nigerians directly in the last 14 years. He added that the social investments were guided by the Deep Offshore Community Affairs Group (DOCAG) principles, and that the whole country hosts DW operations. DOCAG is a coalition of oil and gas companies with interest in deep water exploration and production. Crises of insurgency, kidnapping and farmer-herder clashes have prevented the establishment of chest clinics and other projects in some states, Chevron said. He disclosed that the company’s social investments, based on Global Memorandum of Understanding (GMoU), had engendered grouping of communities with similar ethnic affiliations, creation of regional development councils with strong governance and accountability processes, participatory partnership with multiple and community empowerment and ownership of projects. The investments, according to him, have significantly reduced community-induced work disruption, facilitated leadership/human capital development, reduced potentialities for conflicts in communities and enhanced peace-building process. Chevron said N8.4 billion had been disbursed to Agbami Scholarship awardees since 2009, and that 715 students had graduated with first class degrees since the scholarship started. He also said 16,300 medical and engineering undergraduates had benefitted, and over 2,500 awardees currently on the programme.
