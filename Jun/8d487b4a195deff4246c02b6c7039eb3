A female member of the National Youth Service Corp (NYSC), Halima Umar, who was abducted by Boko Haram insurgents in January, has been freed. The released corps member was brought to the office of the Borno State deputy governor, at about 3.30 p.m., on Thursday by a group of security officers led by the General Officer Commanding 7 Division, Abdulmalik Biu. Biu, while addressing the state deputy governor, Umar Kadafur, said the corps member was rescued “through various collaborative efforts of the state government, security agencies and other critical stakeholders.” He said the collaboration of efforts that led to Umar’s rescue was what the Nigeria military had been advocating. Kadafur appeal to the security agencies to expedite efforts to rescue the remaining Chibok school girls still in captivity of the Boko haram insurgents. More than 100 out of the 276 schoolgirls who were abducted by the armed group Boko Haram, on April 14, 2014, are yet to regain freedom.
