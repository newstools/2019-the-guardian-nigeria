A Pharmaceutical firm in Kano State has called on the police authorities in the state to revisit the issue of claims by the police that cartons of Tramadol were discovered in the company. The firm, Ugolab Manufacturing Company, has dissociated itself from the allegation, saying what were found in the company were not cartons of Tramadol drugs but Declofenac. The Kano police command had in May claimed that its operatives recovered 303 cartons of prohibited Tramadol in the company. CP Wakili Mohammed had while briefing newsmen at the command headquarters in Bompai, said the seizure, followed a tip-off, “prompting a police special squad to rush to the scene and impound the 303 cartons of the hard drugs at No. 157 Miller Road, Bompai in Nassarawa LGA.” But in a reaction, the management of the firm has refuted the claim by the police saying that what was recovered was Diclofenac and not Tramadol. Production Process Manager of Ugolab, Mr. Peter Eguabor, who spoke with newsmen in Lagos, said the police did not come to the company on a tip-off as claimed. “What happened was that there was a robbery incident at the company’s warehouse at about 3:53a.m. on that fateful day. The robbers made away with four cartons of Diclofenac Sodium and Diphenhydramine HCL among others. The company invited the police. We called the control room and the police came.”Trouble started when on arrival at the scene, the police officer who led the team opened a carton of Diclofenac and alleged that it was Tramadol. The police took three cartons away. The General Manager and the Quality Assurance manager went to give a statement and took with them a carton of the medicine, making four cartons. The police later came back to collect the remaining 352 cartons of the drugs.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
