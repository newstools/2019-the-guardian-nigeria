Also on ground to receive him were Alhaji Tunde Balogun, Chairman, APC, Lagos State and Mr Joe Igbokwe, Publicity Secretary, APC, Lagos State. Addressing newsmen, Balogun described Gbajabiamila as a detribalised Nigerian who had contributed immensely to the nation’s law making processes. Balogun said :”We are celebrating him today not because he is a Lagosian, but because he has distinguished himself in the national assembly. “He is eloquent, dedicated, broad minded and a loyal party member who supported his predecessors, Aminu Tambuwal and Yakubu Dogara, to perform their duties effectively. “That is why majority of the people who supported his aspirations were not even from the South West because they knew him as a detribalised Nigerian, ” he said. He expressed optimism that Gbajabiamila’s leadership of the Ninth assembly would ensure  harmonious relationship between the Executive and  Legislature for the betterment of Nigerians. “The lawmakers are to work with the executive arm to deliver  dividends of democracy to Nigerians and we are expecting robust legislation to achieve that objective,” he said .
