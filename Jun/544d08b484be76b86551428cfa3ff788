 [FILES] Edo state  The attack on 15 lawmakers, including Mr. Seidu Oshiomhole (Etsako West II), younger brother to former Governor Adams Oshiomhole, who is national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), left some with serious inquiries. Some of the victims were rushed to an undisclosed hospital for treatment that night. The 15, who are loyal to the APC national chairman, were not invited to the Monday night inauguration of the assembly where nine members met to elect Mr. Frank Okiye (Esan North East 1) as speaker. Sources told The Guardian that the fracas was not unconnected with the emergence of Okiye, who was rumoured to be Governor Godwin Obaseki’s loyalist. According to an aide of one of the lawmakers, who would not want his name in print, the attack, which happened at a hotel in Benin City during a meeting by the lawmakers, saw both hotel staff and guests scampering for safety. A police source, who was not authorised to speak to the press, said that former deputy speaker, Mr. Victor Edoror, led his colleagues to the police headquarters in Benin City to report the assault. Some of Edoror’s aides, who accompanied him to the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID), were seen in clusters, apparently discussing the issue. Efforts to get confirmation of the attack from the Commissioner of Police, DanMallam Mohammed, proved abortive as his mobile phone was engaged.
