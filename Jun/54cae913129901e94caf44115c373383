(Photo by Handout / VATICAN MEDIA / AFP) / A 3.7-magnitude earthquake struck near Rome on Sunday evening, the Italian geophysics institute said, with local media reporting it caused no damage. The epicentre of the quake was near Colonna, a small city around 30 kilometres (20 miles) east of Rome. There was no noticeable damage or injuries from the tremor, local media said citing the civil protection service and witnesses. Many residents of Colonna and surrounding areas did leave their homes after the quake hit at 8:43 pm (1943 GMT). It was at a shallow nine kilometres deep which explains why the quake was felt even though it was of moderate magnitude, experts told the Agi news agency. Rome is not directly situated in a zone of strong seismic activity, but stronger earthquakes in the neighbouring Abruzzi region have often been felt in the Italian capital.
