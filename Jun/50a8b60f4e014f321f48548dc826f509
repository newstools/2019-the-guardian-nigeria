 Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, with Afenifere leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo during the latter’s visit to the governor in Ibadan …yesterday                                                                                            PHOTO: NAN  Makinde’s Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Taiwo Adisa said: “Oyo State government committed no illegality in dissolving the councils. Rather, the government took the step in defence of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The laws say that you cannot create local governments without recourse to constitutional procedures. “The immediate past state government went ahead to create LCDAs in total disregard for the Constitution. They also jointly conducted elections into the recognised councils and the LCDAs the same day. By that singular act, they have tainted the elections conducted into the 33 local governments with illegality. You cannot mix apple and oranges together and call it a basket of apples or a basket of oranges. So the state is out to stop the illegality.” Meanwhile, Makinde will tomorrow inaugurate the 9th Oyo State House of Assembly, comprising 26 Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) lawmakers, five for the All Progressives Congress (APC) and one Action Democratic Party (ADP) lawmaker. The outgoing Speaker, Hon. Olagunju Ojo, highlighting the achievements of the 8th Assembly at the valedictory service on Friday, revealed that with the consideration of 157 motions, 87 bills and 70 laws passed, they performed better than their predecessors. Present at the ceremony were the representatives of Oyo State Chief Judge, Justice Munta Abimbola; Commissioner of Police, Shina Olukolu and the state Head of Service, Mrs. Amidat Ololade Agboola.
