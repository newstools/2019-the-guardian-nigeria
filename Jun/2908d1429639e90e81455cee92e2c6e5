 Seyi Makinde  “APC views the decision of the governor as a reflection of the new government’s ignorance of constitutional matters. The governor should know and be advised that all the decisions made by Ajimobi were within his constitutional rights as the sitting governor. His mandate only ended on May 28 and actions taken while he held the mandate were within his right as governor and within the letters of the constitution.” The party frowned at Makinde’s decision to reverse the promotion of permanent secretaries, but that of the head of service who reportedly is his wife’s ally. “Governor Makinde seems to be forgetting that he has a four-year mandate. He should therefore reflect deeply on his actions before they are carried out. What he has done clearly shows the impunity that was the hallmark of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) before the progressives brought sanity into governance. Oyo and Nigeria should not go back to the years of locust,” he added. Meanwhile, Makinde has promised to run a transparent administration for the state to attain the desired heights.He made the promise yesterday during a thanksgiving service at the Cathedral of St. Peters, Aremo in Ibadan. The governor said it was the prayers of the churches and those who wanted him as the governor that were answered. He said: “Now that your prayers have been answered, I’m here and ready to serve the people.“I implore the church to keep on praying for my administration to succeed”.Earlier, provost of the church, Revd. Andrew Adebiyi, had urged the governor not to allow the pressure of office to take away humility, kindness and other good leadership qualities he is known for.
