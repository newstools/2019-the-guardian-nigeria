Award-winning singer and songwriter, John Legend is steady showing off that he has other talents with this new role as executive producer for a new Amazon series. The new series which is loosely inspired by actress Sandra Bullock’s college years will also have fellow co-producers Akiva Goldsman and Bullock herself on board as announced on Monday. Taking place in the American deep south in the ’80s, the series will be a dramedy set in the world of music and dance where a young woman defies expectations and seeks out the community and her own identity. The show will touch on drag culture, mental health and the AIDS epidemic while following a group of young outcasts. This won’t be the first time the “All of Me” singer has ventured into the television and film world. Legend is currently a judge on The Voice and has also served as executive producer for the acapella-focused docuseries Sing It On and the animated short film Crow: The Legend. The Originals writer K.C. Perry is slated to write and executive produce the project; Amazon has yet to reveal any details on a release date.
