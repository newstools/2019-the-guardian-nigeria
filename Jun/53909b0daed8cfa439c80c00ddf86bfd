If the name Divine Oduduru does not ring a bell, “i never experred it” would.  Nigeria’s Divine Oduduru who currently holds a record in the US as the NCAA 100m champion and a nominee of the Bow Man award has revealed to the public, that his preferred home base is the US. In a recent interview with FOX34’s Sports Overtime anchor, Cassie Carlson, he said that Texas Tech feels more like home than his country Nigeria adding that they created the platform for him to actualise his dream. Take a look: This reveal is coming after Nigerians, in their usual fashion, took to social media to hail his recent winnings. Oduduru whose new popular phrase is “I worked for it” recently announced that he is ready to go pro and will drop of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) scholarship. This move opens him up to making over NGN180 million annually, his coach Wes Kittley has revealed.  An action that has since sparked conversations on why Nigeria lays claim to her citizens when they become successful.
