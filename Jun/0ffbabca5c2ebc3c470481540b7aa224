Disney has finally released the first official trailer for James Gray’s “Ad Astra” space epic film, starring Brad Pitt. With the debut of its first trailer, it appears the recently announced September release is moving forward as planned. The film being Gray’s first directorial project since the Pitt-produced “The Lost City of Z,” has been long in the works, as the director has blown through release dates because of an extensive post-production process. “Ad Astra” stars Brad Pitt as an Army Corps engineer who decides to go on an ambitious space mission to find out the truth behind the mysterious disappearance of his father, who set out on a journey to Neptune looking for signs of extra-terrestrial intelligence but never returned. The supporting cast includes Tommy Lee Jones, Ruth Negga, Donald Sutherland, and Jamie Kennedy. Walt Disney Motion Picture Studios will release “Ad Astra” in theatres September 20. Watch the first official trailer in the video below.
