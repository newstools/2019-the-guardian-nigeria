The 9th Senate Thursday rejected a motion raised through a point of order by a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) senator, Istifanius Dung Gyang, urging the upper legislative chamber to debate the speech President Muhammadu Buhari delivered on during the celebration of Democracy Day. The motion was shut down in a voice vote, which saw more senators opting not to back the motion. Gyang, relying on Order 52 of Senate Rules, said he was bringing a matter of Urgent National importance that has to do with the Democracy Day speech of President Muhammadu Buhari of the 12th June 2019. “This speech is already in the public domain,’ Senator Gyang said. The President of the Senate, however, cut him short, saying he had to seek the consent of the senators for the approval whether he should proceed or not. The motion was shut down as the nays carried the day. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
