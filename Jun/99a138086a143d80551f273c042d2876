The royal couple received huge cheers from the sell-out 60,000 crowd in east London. Earlier, New York manager Aaron Boone presented Meghan with a tiny version of the Yankees’ famous pin-striped shirt emblazoned with Archie’s name and the number 19, while Red Sox players gave her a baby-grow in the team’s colours.
