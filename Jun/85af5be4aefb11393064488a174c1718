The long-serving leader, who turns 65 next month, sparked renewed fears for her health Thursday when she began to tremble at a ceremony with the German president at his Berlin palace. A previous, more severe bout of uncontrollable shaking last week was blamed on dehydration at an outdoor event on a hot summer’s day. Officials sought to play down the fears over her health. Her spokesman Steffen Seibert said she would not cancel any of her engagements in the coming days, which promise to be gruelling. Merkel, who has been in power for nearly 14 years, is to participate in the two-day G20 gathering and is holding a number of bilateral meetings including with US President Donald Trump. She flies from Osaka straight to a crunch EU summit on Sunday where leaders will seek to break a post-election deadlock on who will lead the bloc’s institutions. Merkel has said she will leave politics at the end of her term in 2021. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
