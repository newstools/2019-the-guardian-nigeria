Actress, Jameela Jamil has taken to social media to slam model, Amber Rose for promoting a special ‘pregnancy’ tea. A pregnant 35-year-old Rose had shared the product to her nearly 19 million followers on Instagram yesterday, June 19 as she held the product close to her bare baby bump. In her ad, Rose wrote about the product that hails from Flat Tummy Co, famous for its detox, “This is not a detox tea – it’s specially designed to help reduce occasional nausea and support digestion during pregnancy – haters stop riding the bandwagon and think for yourselves.” Horrified at the advert, Jamil screengrabbed Rose’s post and tweeted, “FLAT TUMMY PRODUCTS FOR… PREGNANT WOMEN? Is this FDA approved? Are we… fu**ing… KIDDING?” 33-year-old Jamil who has always been vocal about celebrities promoting things that has to do with women’s weight wrote, “So many women, with such big platforms, promoting such irresponsible fu**sh*t, that it blows my mind,” The NBC star went on to share Rose’s ad on her own page and wrote, “NO AMBER ROSE, NO.” Jamil in times past has called out other celebrities like Kim and Khloe Kardashian as well as Cardi B for promoting diet supplements and detox teas. According to Jamil, she is not trying to “cancel anyone,” she has been vocal about creating a culture that’s not weight-obsessed (or pushes weight loss products for quick cash). About this she says, “I’m developing a thing called the F*cksh*t Detox…it’s like a juice fast, but instead, you just eliminate all of the bad, toxic people and things that are in your life, rather than food,” Jamil announced at the BlogHer Health conference in Los Angeles on January 25. Rose is currently pregnant with her second child and she shares her first with rapper, Wiz Khalifa.
