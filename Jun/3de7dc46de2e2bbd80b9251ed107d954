 Prof. Olukunle Iyanda, NIM President  “It is even more worrying with the incidences of ballot-box snatching, voters’ intimidation, insecurity as well as manipulation on the basis of religion and ethnicity. These have led to a significant number of tribunal cases after the rejection of election results by the opposition at state or federal level,” he added.
 
According to the VC, other challenges bedevilling democracy include low literacy level among the rural dwellers, poverty, inefficient transportation system, incompetent and corrupt electoral personnel, voters apathy, vote buying, under-age voting, lack of internal democracy, media inflammatory statement and weak confidence in the electoral tribunal, ethnic and religious divide and faulty card readers.
 
To get rid of these challenges, Ogundipe charged the National Orientation Agency (NOA) to consistently educate and enlighten citizens on their civic responsibilities through well-coordinated strategies that promote democracy.
 
He added that the electoral legal framework should be strengthened as the amended 1999 constitution and 2010 Electoral Act contain essential elements of a sound legal framework for the conduct of election in Nigeria.
 
Ogundipe lauded efforts of the Institute for its contribution to manpower development and training of staff, which has greatly impacted in service delivery in higher institution and its leadership for advancing solutions to the nation’s social and economic quagmires.
