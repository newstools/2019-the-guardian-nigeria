 [FILE PHOTO] Former Ekiti State Governor Ayo Fayose arrivING at the office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission  Kafarati noted a petition against the trial judge by the prosecution, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission prompted the transfer. The case has now been transferred to Chukwujekwu Aneke. The anti-graft agency in a petition dated May 21, 2019, and signed by its chairman, Ibrahim Magu, sought the transfer of the case away from the trial judge, Mojisola Olatoregun. EFCC said it has “lost confidence” in Olatoregun, a judge in the Federal High Court in Ikoyi, Lagos. “I refer to the petition of EFCC on this case and your Lordship’s comments thereto,” the transfer letter dated May 23, 2019, said. “It is apparent that the prosecution has lost confidence in the judge trying this case and justice must not only be done but must be seen to have been done, I hereby transfer this case to Hon. Justice C. J. Aneke for hearing,” Kafarati said. The EFCC’s request came following a heated exchange in open court during the last proceedings between Judge Olatoregun and Rotimi Jacobs, the EFCC’s counsel. Fayose is facing an 11-count charge of conspiracy and money laundering instituted by the EFCC. He was charged alongside a company, Spotless Investment Limited and arraigned in October last year. He pleaded not guilty to all the charges and was granted bail in the sum of N50 million with one surety in like sum. With the transfer of the case, however, the trial is expected to begin afresh.
