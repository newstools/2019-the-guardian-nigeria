“The goalkeeper did not concede a goal, which is a good one for him and for the team. He stopped Burundi in the first half from a wonderful opportunity. If you remembered, the Burundi striker was alone and he disturbed him from scoring. In this situation, he was really good.
 
“Then we know sometimes he also makes mistakes like what happened, especially when he had the ball and he wanted to quickly play it. I didn’t like it but I believe he will try to make it better next time.” Rohr said Akpeyi got the number one shirt because “in the last three weeks, he was really so good during the training sessions and that is why today he is our number goalkeeper.”Nigeria’s next match is against Guinea at the Alexandria Stadium on Wednesday.
