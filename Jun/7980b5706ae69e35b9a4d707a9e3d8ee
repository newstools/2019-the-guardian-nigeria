Atlanta Rapper and record producer Future has just simultaneously dropped three videos for three tracks off his “Save Me” EP. The videos include “Government Official”, “Love Thy Enemies” which puts Future on a therapist’s couch of sorts and the anime-inspired “XanaX Damage.” Additionally, the three-part video drop is accompanied by a drop of the wearable variety, i.e. an exclusive merch collection in collaboration with Levy. The limited run features “XanaX Damage” black-and-white sweatshirts, all-black Save Me hats, and more. All three videos were directed by Henri Alexander Levy, founder of the iconic Enfants Riches Déprimés. Watch “Government Official”, “Love Thy Enemies” and “XanaX Damage.” via YouTube below;
