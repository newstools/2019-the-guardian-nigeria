Chairman, Lagos First Generation Heritage Colleges Association (LAFGHECA), Yussuf Risikat; BOT Chairman, LAFGHECA, Otunba Dele Olapeju; Kings College Lagos football team Captain, Ohazurume Kizito; and Head, Event Management/Corporate Communications and External Affairs, GTBank, Jide Sipe, at the final of the GTBank Season Eight Masters Cup held in Lagos…at the weekend. Kings College, Lagos at the weekend won this year’s Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GTBank Plc) Season Eight Masters Cup played at the Campos Mini Stadium, Lagos Island. In the final of the competition, which is an offshoot of the GTBank-Lagos State Principals Cup, Kings College defeated Anwar-Ul-Islam Model College, Agege 5-4 on penalties to cart away this year’s title. At the finals were fans of the schools and other youth football lovers, who defied the torrential downpour to watch the game hampered by the flooded pitch of the stadium. Anwar-Ul-Islam was the better team in the first half, but they paid for their inability to utilise several scoring chances they had to seal up the match. The second half was in no way better as the rain persisted and distorted the flow of the game. What would have been the winner in the last minute of the game was wasted by Kings College and the match had to be decided by penalty shoot bouts. While Kings College scored all their five kicks, Anwar-Ul-Islam missed one to hand the cup to the Island boys for the first time in the competition. In their journey to the final, Kings College beat Whitesands School 4-1 in the semifinals, while Anwar-Ul-Islam dismissed CSM Grammar School, Bariga.
