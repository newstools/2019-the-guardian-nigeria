Photo/Twitter/RangersIntFC  The 2017 champions, who lost their first match 0-2 to Enyimba, beat Lobi Stars last Thursday and a victory on Saturday would have taken them to six points, same with second-placed Enyimba and a point behind Kano Pillars. But they let it slip off their hands. Today at the Agege Stadium, they are up against the leaders, Kano Pillars, who will automatically qualify for next seasonâ€™s CAF Champions League with a win today. Pillars drew their first game against Akwa United, caused the biggest surprise of the championship with a 2-0 defeat of Enyimba in the second game before beating whipping boys, FC IfeanyiUbah 2-1 on Saturday. A win today will take them to 10 points. The game will kick off by 3.00 p.m. The second match will pit Akwa United against Lobi Stars, who are desperate for a win to salvage their championship. Lobi Stars were one of the pre-championship favourites following their strong run in to the end of the regular season. But an opening day defeat of FC IfeanyiUbah has been tempered by losses to Rangers and Enyimba in the championship. And so to resuscitate their chances of gaining a continental ticket through this competition, they must beat Akwa United today. That could be a hard ask as Akwa United, on four points, still fancy their chances of winning this competition or getting at least a continental ticket. That they would do by winning their last two games against Lobi Stars and Enyimba. The last game of the day on paper promises a straightforward victory for Enyimba against bottom-placed team, FC IfeanyiUbah. A win for Enyimba will take the Aba boys to nine points, which will set them up for the final cracker against Akwa United.
