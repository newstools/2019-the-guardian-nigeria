The pioneer Bishop of the Diocese of Nnewi and Archbishop of the Province of the Niger, Most Rev. Prof. Godwin Okpala, who is retiring very soon from active service, after 23 years of episcopacy in the Church of Nigeria, Anglican Communion, last week, held his last synod. Speaking at the 3rd Session of the 8th Synod themed: “Steadfastness In God’s Service,” at St. Thomas Anglican Church, Otolo, Nnewi in Anambra State, the outgoing Bishop called on diocese members not to allow anything or anyone to undermine their enthusiasm for God and His agenda. He urged them to emulate the Lord Jesus Christ, Who worked without being distracted, but was focused and steadfast in doing God’s work, which made Him a role model. “Distractions come in diverse ways, and are aimed at frustrating God’s agenda. Therefore, steadfastness in God’s work can only be achieved through diligent study of His word, consistent prayer life and unwavering faith in Him,” he said, adding that God’s work is the manual that could help Christians to render steadfast services. To develop spiritual stability and avoid distraction, the cleric enjoined Christians to be in constant connection with God through prayer, which will help them to fulfil God’s Will on earth, as well as make heaven. He said: “For every Christian, doing God’s work is not an option. It is an obligation that must be carried out judiciously, because God expects believers to discover their area of calling and use it to serve Him steadfastly in the Church and society.” The Archbishop said Christians should shun corruption, if only they are diligent in their service to God, cited Daniel in the Bible as an example, and how he served God diligently, even in dire circumstances. He said: “Being in a corrupt system is never an excuse to allow one’s light to diminish.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
