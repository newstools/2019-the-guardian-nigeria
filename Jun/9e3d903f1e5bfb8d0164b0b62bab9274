Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG) for Zone 9, Mr. Baba Tijani has enjoined Orphanage Home operators to abide by the provisions of the extant laws or risk the consequence of prosecution.He said this when a delegation of the South East Chapter of Association of Orphanages and Homes Operators of Nigeria (ASOHON) visited his office in Umuahia, Abia State capital to seek Police protection from invasion by security operatives and hoodlums. The AIG described as illegal and criminal for any Orphanage Home Operators to engage in the business of procuring/luring pregnant teenage girls to be delivered of their babies and thereafter, illegally give out such babies, stressing that it is through this practice that prostitution, child trafficking and use of babies for rituals thrive. He charged them to strictly operate in accordance with legal/government stipulations and to report threats to their homes to enable the Police do the needful. ASOHON’s Grand Patron, High Chief Akpulonu Godson said the way and manner some security agencies invade their homes by jumping their fences and breaking their doors is sad. According to him, arresting a suspected registered Orphanage Operator should follow due process of law rather than security personnel invading the operator’s home with guns to effect the arrest, stressing that ASOHON members in the course of their legitimate service to humanity  “would remain committed to partnering government and security agencies to stop child-trafficking among others.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
