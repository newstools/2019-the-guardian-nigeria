The Comptroller-General of Immigration (CG), Muhammed Babandade, has charged newly promoted officers in Zone A command, Lagos not to go home and start sleeping. No fewer than 26 officers were promoted in the zone. CG Babandade, who was speaking during the decoration of the newly promoted officers, said: “You are wearing new ranks, but that should not make you to go to bed. You should know that you are now putting on new caps and shoes, which is a new level of higher responsibility, dedication to duty and effectiveness to your call.” The CG who was represented by Assistant Controller General of Immigration, ACG Alfa Muhammad, said: “I remember when the CG decorated newly promoted officers, he told them that their new ranks should not make them to go to sleep, but to make them awake to their new tasks because to whom much is given, much is expected of him. This advice is what I want to be replicated in this zone. You should lead by examples. Alfa, who was assisted during the decoration by senior officers, including Comptroller Kings Ekpedeme, said the service was growing in strength and might and officers should live up to expectation. The decorated officers are three Deputy Comptrollers of Immigration, seven Assistants Comptrollers, one Chief Superintendent, three Deputy Superintendent among others.
