Marvel fans in China will get to see Spider-Man: Far From Home first, as the sequel is set to release in China on June 28, several days ahead of its U.S. release in July. Deadline reports, the reason for the early release in China is the country’s summer blackout on foreign movies. China imposes strict limits on the number of foreign movies that can be released in theaters, and also has blackout periods during the Chinese New Year and the summer holidays to ensure that Chinese films don’t have any foreign competition at the box office during the most popular times of the year for moviegoers.  Releasing on June 28 means that Spider-Man: Far From Home will get a week in Chinese theaters before the blackout begins, which will likely mean a huge opening weekend for the movie as Chinese fans flock to see it before the window closes. China represents a massive share of Marvel’s target market, with Avengers: Endgame grossing $629.1 million (so far) in China alone, so this early release of Spider-Man: Far From Home should give the movie a solid boost before it arrives in North American theaters. It seems like a pretty fair deal since China had to wait two extra months before seeing the first of its sequel.
