Only Mozambique, with 12, have played more games in the competition without recording a win. Guinea-Bissau, who appeared for the first time in this competition in 2017, picked up their first point in Group F as both sides remained in contention for a place in the last 16. Holders Cameroon top the section on four points, with Benin and four-time champions Ghana level on two. Angola and Mauritania started the day with a 0-0 draw in Suez after the previous 21 matches produced 43 goals. Cameroon and Ghana then played out a goalless stalemate in the first game of the doubleheader in the northern city of Ismailia. Sori Mane rifled wide from distance in a rare opportunity for a Guinea-Bissau side ranked 118th in the world, 30 places behind their opponents. Former Sunderland and West Brom midfielder Stephane Sessegnon returned to the Benin line-up after suspension but it was Huddersfield forward Steve Mounie who had his team’s best chances, drawing a sharp save from Jonas Mendes and then heading over unmarked from a Sessegnon free-kick.
