Twenty-seven lawmakers of the Imo State House of Assembly, presided over by the Speaker, Dr. Chiji Chimezie Collins, have raised the alarm over alleged incessant attacks by herdsmen in various communities of their constituencies in the 27 local councils of the state. They, therefore, resolved and urged the two major security chiefs in the state (Brigade Commander of 34 Field Artillery Brigade, Obinze, near Owerri and the Commissioner of Police) to act fast and tackle the killings allegedly being perpetrated by the herders.
Besides, the lawmakers accused the herdsmen of threatening the peace in the state by using their cattle to attack their constituents. The Speaker consequently directed the Clerk of the House to communicate by writing to the security chiefs the resolution of the state lawmakers.
