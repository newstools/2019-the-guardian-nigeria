Popular Ghanaian actor, Majid Michel in a new video has stated that religion is a major factor for destruction. This is coming as a surprise to many of his fans considering that he has been very religious lately and even been seen preach, performing miracles and more. According to Michel, his eyes are now opened to the truth. He said, “The number one or two problems on earth, if not leadership, is caused by religion.” He went on to state that every religion whether it is Christianity, Buddhism, Hindu and even Islam “has a history of violence and history of destroying humanity, hence can’t be tagged Godly.” In conclusion, the actor stated that he thinks the world has to move away from religion, and focus on spirituality. It would be recalled that in an earlier report, we reported that Michel was rumoured to have suffered throat problems and flown abroad for treatment. The report was however debunked as false by his friend, Pascal Amanfo who revealed that the pictures mistaken to have been taken at a hospital was actually showing the actor in an airplane. Amanfo  wrote, @ghkwaku Kwaku can you also tell them that there was no surgery…no such diagnosis and that, that picture was taken from an AirFrance flight and not in a hospital?”
