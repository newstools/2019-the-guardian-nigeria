Former Super Eagles’ defender, Ifeanyi Udeze believes Nigeria has the quality to win the forthcoming African Cup of Nations. He also says the team could easily fail at the competition despite the array of stars in its fold. Udeze, who played in tow Nations Cup in 2002 and 2004, the Super Eagles would be difficult to beat if they dropped the quest for personal glory and play as a team, adding many teams had faltered on the altar of pride and quest to exhibit individual skills. According to the former West Bromwich Albion defender, after spending close to two weeks together, the coaches should be able to identify to lapses in the team and use individual attributes to build a good team before the competition kicks off next week. He said Coach Gernot Rohr selected the players he already knew quite well for Nations cup, adding that blending the regular stars with the new players should not be a problem for the Franco-German. Udeze, however, expressed reservations on the inclusion of Leon Balogun in the team, saying the Brighton of England player was largely inactive last season as his team kept him on the bench most times. Positing that the coach must have his reasons for Choosing Balogun, Udeze said, “My advice for the Super Eagles now is to play as a unit to be able to succeed in Egypt. “Every player in the squad has to work for the team. This is the only way they can succeed. The Super Eagles also need total support from Nigerians.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
