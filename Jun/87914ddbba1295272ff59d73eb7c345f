Pepenazi is not slowing down this year as he has released another catchy tune titled, “Fine”. The new track is a followup to his debut single of 2019, “Amazing” and we have to admit that he is doing amazingly fine. Produced by Krizbeatz, “Fine” is an eclectic Afrocentric feel-good music with an element of live acoustic sound and lyrics that reflects the deep root of basic African Love tales. Light percussion and a groove that puts you on your feet but still lifts the spirit with the soulful strings & baseline attached to it. Releasing an accompanying video for the happy song, Pepenazi is seen with his love interest as they enjoy a lovestruck dance together in the ZechFilms directed video. The video was shot when the singer was on tour in the United Kingdom and also reflects a lover’s tiff as we see his love interest attempting to leave him at a point in the music video. Their love, however, conquers their differences as she stays and their love waxes strong.
