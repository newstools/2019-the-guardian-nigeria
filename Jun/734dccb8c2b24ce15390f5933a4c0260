Bronx Rapper Cardi B recently released a new track titled “Press” and of course her usual flair and charisma is amply present on it. The rapper first teased the song back in December 2018, posting a video of her inside the studio while reciting a few lines and that got fans excited for new music. The track has a confrontational undertone as she is addressing people that poke their nose in her personal affairs. “Press, press, press, press, press/Cardi don’t need more press,” she rapped. “Kill ’em all, put them hoes to rest/Walk in, bulletproof vest/Please tell me who she gon’ check/Murder scene, Cardi made a mess.” Press was produced by Slade Da Monsta.
