Unai Emery’s squad will open the new Premier League season with a trip to St James’ Park against Newcastle. The Spaniard in his sophomore season will be battling for the top-four place to end Arsenal’s Champions League absence after three seasons. Emery will be desperate to right his wrongs, after losing the Europa League Cup finals to Chelsea at Baku, ending his first season at Arsenal trophy-less and without Champions League qualification. With no player in view to bring in yet, Arsenal might be facing a tougher challenge in the new season with other clubs spending big and improving their squads. Here are Arsenal’s fixtures for the 2019/20 season in full: August
