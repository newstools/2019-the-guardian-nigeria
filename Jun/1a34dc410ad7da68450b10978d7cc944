Rivers State governor Nyesom Wike has said the government will not tolerate the shutting down of oil production facilities of operating companies in the state. Wike in a statement by his media aide Simeon Nwakaudu gave the warning at a meeting with members of Cluster Development Boards in Asari-Toru, Akuku-Toru and Degema Local Government Areas, representatives of oil Companies and security agencies in Port Harcourt. “I will not support any company not to carry out their corporate social responsibilities to their host communities. “However, communities must not take laws into their hands. They must not stop production by the operating companies. Such actions will negatively affect the finances of the Federal Government, the state and the local government areas”. He said in cases where companies fail to act within the expectations of the communities, the State Government will mediate through the Steering Committee on Cluster Development Boards. Governor Wike said under no circumstances should communities take laws into their hands by preventing oil production companies from working. Wike explained that it was important to prevent crisis occurring in the communities. The governor said the committee will meet at regular intervals to address challenges with membership from permanent secretaries, community development, security agencies and oil companies in the state.
