Newlyweds Idris and Sabrina Elba are British Vogue’s star on a special bridal cover for its July issue. In the issue, the couple talks about their thrilling 3-day wedding in Marrakesh, Morroco. But, as revealed by British Vogue’s editor-in-chief Edward Enninful – a friend and guest of the bride and groom – ‘behind the extraordinary celebrations lies a simple tale as old as time’. “We’ve been literally inseparable since we met,” Elba told Enninful. On a fateful night in 2017 in a Vancouver jazz bar, while Idris was filming The Mountain Between Us in the city, they locked eyes and it was “love at first sight”. “You know, I’m 47 this year, been married and lived a full life before I even met Sabrina,” he continued. “It wasn’t something that I wanted to do, get married again. But…” Sabrina Dhowre and Idris Elba chose to marry in Morocco because the bride and groom’s families are from the east and west Africa respectively, and so it seemed apt to meet in the middle, Vogue reports..
