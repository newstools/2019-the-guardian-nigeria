Adamawa governor elect, Alhaji Ahmadu Fintiri Adamawa State Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri may shut down the state polytechnic in Yola over the alleged discovery of arms in the mosque inside the school premises. The Guardian gathered that a non-academic staff (name withheld) had last week drawn the attention of the Department of State Services (DSS) to the matter without informing the chief security officer (CSO) of the school. Further investigations revealed that the arms were relocated when the CSO discovered and reported to the rector, Professor Ibrahim Umar. Our correspondent also gathered that the school management shut the mosque as tension was gathering in the school campus, to ensure that the matter did get to the public. Prof. Umar admitted the closure of the mosque to The Guardian, but denied arms discovery inside it. “It is true that the mosque inside the polytechnic in Yola has been closed for now. This is because the school management discovered that some people were coming from outside the school to sleep inside the mosque,” he stated. On the first day the rector resumed duty, there was bloody clash between Muslim and Christian students, which reportedly left one person dead and many others injured.
