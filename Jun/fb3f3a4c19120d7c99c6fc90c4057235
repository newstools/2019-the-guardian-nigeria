His release came about 14 days after a Federal High Court in Lagos granted his bail application. Justice Nicholas Oweibo set Naira Marley’s total bond at N2 million with two sureties in like sum on May 30. Oweibo said the sureties must be a civil servant not below the grade 10 level and must have a landed property in a jurisdiction approved by the court. Naira Marley’s management last Thursday said there was a delay from the EFCC due to the need to properly verify the information of the sureties and “court will still have sign the release paper.” The anti-graft agency had on May 20, arraigned Fashola on an 11-count charge of alleged credit card fraud. The commission alleged that some of the credit cards discovered in his residence bore the names Nicole Louise Malyon and Timea Fedorne Tatar. Naira Marley pleaded not guilty to all the charges that the commission said contravenes the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act and the Cyber Crimes Act.
