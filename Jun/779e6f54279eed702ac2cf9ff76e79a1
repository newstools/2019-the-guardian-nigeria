There was tension at the popular Okada junction on the Benin-Lagos expressway when some youths protested against the killing of an indigene of Okada community by suspected Fulani herdsmen. The youths, in their numbers, angered by the incessant attack and killings in their community, went into the bush and sacked the camps of the cattle-rearers. The circumstances surrounding the killing were sketchy but the youths were said to have marched through the junction town of Ofumwengbe in Ovia North East local government area of Edo State, demanding that the herdsmen leave the area. Vehicular movement on the busy highway was disrupted for several hours as the road was blocked by the protesters who carried fresh leaves as a mark of solidarity to condemn the killings. The Edo State Commissioner of Police, DanMallam Mohammed, could not be reached on his mobile phone as it was switched off at the time of filing this report, while the police spokesman, Chidi Nwanbuzor, didnâ€™t pick calls put across to him. Only last month, a lecturer, Azebiokhai of Igbinedion University at nearby Okada was gunned down by suspected Fulani during a kidnap operation. Also, a driver conveying an ambulance donated by the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) from Port Harcourt in Rivers State to Akure, Ondo State, was also killed in a bungled kidnap operation.
