Osinbajo, who is also the Executive Chairman of the Presidential Taskforce on the Apapa Traffic Gridlock, while speaking during a visit to the port, said his call was a pointer to Federal Government’s readiness to work with Lagos Government in finding lasting solution to the gridlock that has become an eyesore along the nation’s busiest ports. The Vice President, accompanied by Sanwo-Olu during the visit, said: “There are several aspects of the task that has to be done in decongesting the port. There have been a lot of infrastructure projects around the Lagos ports, initiated by the Federal Government. “Some of these projects have been completed; a lot are still ongoing. However, clearing the roads of trailers and oil tankers is the major issue that is of concern to the people. The good news is that there is a considerable improvement in this regard.” Sanwo-Olu said his administration would be ever ready to complement any effort by the Federal Government to ensure decongestion of the area, to ease the pains of residents and businesses.
