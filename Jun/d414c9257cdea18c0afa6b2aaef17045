Sir: I will not subscribe to the rumour that the original father of Bola Ahmed Tinubu was a Fulani Muslim, even though I have heard a similar rumour about Raufu Aregbesola, the former governor of Osun State, Rashidi Akanbi in Iwo town, and some other associates of the Tinubu political circle. Tinubu is my contemporary (being not much older than me), and I know that in those days, some Fulani herdsmen messed around with some Yoruba women, and some Yoruba men were similarly active. But the warning that I will give original Yoruba people is that traditional Africans are not known for politicization of religion, let alone religious war. Tinubu was born into Islam, while I belong to African traditionalists and I did (and I am doing) research on African Traditional Religion (ATR) and culture, and on Christianity and Islam, with particular reference to Nigeria. Fulani Muslims started religious war in Nigeria as from 1804, and lately in 2009 by the late President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua (a Fulani Muslim descendant from the northwest, the headquarters of the Fulani Muslim political hegemony in Nigeria, like the current President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari – GMB). So, why are people like Tinubu and Aregbesola blind to the carnage and economic destruction of Nigeria, 2009 till date? I have said we don’t know who their original fathers were, but religious intolerance and religious war are not known in the star of the Yoruba. That is why Yoruba people, with particular reference to Yoruba Muslims should mind who they are following, because anybody associating with bastards should remember the Yoruba saying: a sheep that is associating with dog will eat faeces. Do not close your minds to how Tinubu has gone to meet GMB in Mecca and speaking fanatically about GMB, totally insensitive to the carnage and economic destruction of Nigeria being perpetuated by GMB. In Christian-dominated areas, for instance in some Igbo towns and villages, Christian youths would go on rampage, attacking adherents of ATR and destroying emblems of ATR. That is the background of the former president Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan ((from south-south)) who joined in the unjustifiable war against Boko Haram. What Yar’Adua did and GMB is doing, are Fulanisation and Islamisation of Nigeria. Jonathan tried to counter with Christianisation and Igbonisation, and so he gave all the “juicy appointments” to some Igbo persons, and gave a jet to the then president of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Ayo Oritsejafor. Thus Nigeria is being consumed by Fulanisation-Islamisation versus Igbonisation-Christianisation. The Fulani-dominated northwest has found allies in Tinubu, Aregbesola, Isiaka Ajimobi, Ibikunle Amosun, Adams Oshiomhole, Rilwanu Akiolu, Rashidi Akanbi, Chris Ngige, Samuel Lalong, Iyiola Oyedepo, Lai Mohammed, et al against the Igbo and Jonathan’s south-south, but where is the place for common people in northwest, southwest, southeast (Igboland), south-south, north-central, northeast? That is why common Nigerians, nationwide, should condemn GMB, Tinubu, Ngige, Rotimi Amaechi, Godswill Akpabio, et al as the new Jẹgúdújerá (Locusts) Association of Nigeria; as the insects that are devouring Nigeria’s crops. Tinubu has gone to Mecca to meet GMB; is Mecca about religion or politics? Open your eyes; see, judge, and act. Islam and Christianity are not about God, but politico-economic exploitation of the masses. Even the preachers preach what they do not practice. Hence Lent and Ramadan come and go while “Satan” waxes stronger and stronger in Mecca, Medina, Nigeria, Western Europe, America, etc. The Yoruba say as greed grows, deception advances in wisdom. GMB and Tinubu are naturally greedy, selfish and wicked.
