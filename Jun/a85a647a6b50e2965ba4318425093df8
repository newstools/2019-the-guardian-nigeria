Enyimba of Aba. • Rangers out, Rivers United in
Barely two weeks after winning the Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL), Enyimba of Aba were yesterday knocked out of the Aiteo Cup by an amateur club. Also out of the Aiteo Cup are defending champions, Enugu Rangers, who were beaten 2-0 by Lobi Stars yesterday. Playing at the University of Benin Sports Centre, Enyimba were beaten 2-3 by non-league Smart City FC of Lagos. The Lagos State FA Cup champions shocked the eighth time league kings in the 17th minute when Bashiru Kareem put them ahead, but they equalised through a Tunde Adejoku own goal. However, to show they meant business, Smart City went ahead again three minutes later through John Gini. The first half ended 2-1 in favour of Smart City. Sensing that the game was getting out of his grips, Enyimba Coach, Usman Abd’Allah brought in some of his top players in the second half, but that did not scare the Lagos giant killers. Although Abdulrahman Bashir, a second half substitute, got Enyimba back on level terms in the 64th minute, it took Smart City just 10 minutes to regain their lead through Abduljabar Umar. They held on to record the biggest upset of the day. In Minna, Michael Stephen scored a brace, one in each half, to give Lobi Stars a sweet revenge over Rangers, who defeated them at the NPFL play-off last week. In other games, Rivers United defeated Akwa United 3-0 with goals from the boots of Kehinde Adedipe, Bright Onyedikachi and Ossy Martins, just as EFCC defeated Sunshine Stars 1-0.
