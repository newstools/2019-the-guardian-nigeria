 Borno State Governor Kashim Shettima (left); his counterparts, Nasir El-Rufai (Kaduna); Jibrilla Bindow (Adamawa) and Commissioner of Police, Kaduna State, Ahmed Abdulrahman briefing State House correspondents after a meeting of security chiefs with President Muhammadu Buhari on the  security situation in the country at the Presidential Villa, Abuja…yesterday.    				                                            PHOTO: PHILIP OJISUA  El-Rufai’s denial came after The Nation newspaper claimed the governor said the country was not ready for state police. “He suspected that the system is capable of being abused in a partisan political environment like Nigeria,” a source allegedly told The Nation. However, El-Rufai’s spokesperson Samuel Aruwan in a statement said the report is a “fable”. “This falsehood is incongruous to the publicly articulated position of Malam Nasir El-Rufai on state police,”  Aruwan said in a statement. “How can a man who chaired a committee that recommended the adoption of state police in 2017 credibly be alleged to be against it,” he added. Aruwan further noted that since the submission of the report of the All Progressives Congress Committee on True Federalism, his principal has been engaged in “advocacy” for its recommendations. “In an under-policed country crying out for more police officers, new technology and modern paradigms of securing communities, adopting state police is imperative,” Aruwan said. Meanwhile the Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), Kayode Fayemi, Wednesday said the forum will soon make its decision on state police known to the public. “The forum has retained security as a growing concern and permanent issue on the agenda of our deliberation, state police is an issue that is of interest to citizens and governors as well,” Fayemi said after the monthly meeting of the forum on Wednesday night “We will continue to review our decision on this and we will communicate our decision to you when we have definite position as a forum,” he added. The debate over the creation of state police has heightened in recent months with the rising insecurity across parts of the country. A panel set up by President Muhammadu Buhari in June recommended the establishment of ‘state and local government police.’  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
