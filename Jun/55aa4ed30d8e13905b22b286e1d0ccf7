 Buhari  Convener of Lokoja Equity Group (LEG), Musa Ibrahim, made the call on behalf of his people at a media briefing yesterday in Lokoja. Ibrahim, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), argued that successive governments in the country have been marginalising Lokoja people, particularly in political appointments. He noted that from 1999 to date, none of the eight ministers so far appointed from Kogi State came from Lokoja, saying Ebira, Igala and Okun people have had their fair share of federal appointments. Ibrahim added that the group decided to seek Buhariâ€™s intervention because the people were confident that he was averse to injustice.
