After years of creating hits behind-the-scenes, internationally acclaimed songwriter Ms. D changed her moniker to Dyo and dove deeper into the music pool as a singer with her hit single ’Arena’. Following the single’s success, the singer decided to take it up a notch, presenting a love song in a way that is a little different from the usual. With its catchy hook and rhythmic beats, Arena remix welcomes listeners to a fun time, only just barely focusing on the romance angle. Produced by Jay Weathers (who has also worked with Mr Eazi and Not3s) and Parker Ighile (who has worked with Jessie J, Ariana Grande, Nicki Minaj), this song has all the makings of an Afropop hit. As an added bonus, the ’Arena’ remix features guitars from AOD, and vocals by Afropop veteran Adekunle Gold. The video, directed by kaykaysublime, also takes an interesting direction.  The visuals are endearing in their simplicity, making use of a lot of warm and neutral tones. Watch the video below:
