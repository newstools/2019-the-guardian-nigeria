The Chief Press Secretary to Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, Terver Akase, has said his boss (Ortom) is not against local council autonomy as being reported in a section of the media. Akase, in a statement yesterday, said that Governor Ortom’s stand in support of autonomy for local councils prompted the National Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) to give him an award in Abuja last year.“Governor Ortom is one of the governors who supported constitutional amendment granting local councils autonomy. “The headlines in some newspapers indicating that Governor Ortom is opposed to local council autonomy are, therefore, misleading and mischievous,” he said.
