Worried by the deplorable state of educational facilities in schools, alumni members have called on the government to address the trend and ensure the implementation of the recently approved minimum wage by all states, to create a favourable environment for students to learn.
 
Speaking with journalists ahead of the 160th founder’s day of CMS Grammar School, Bariga, Lagos state, the chairman of the anniversary committee, Dedapo Fashanu said government must show more commitment to the education of the youth who are the leaders of tomorrow.
 
Fashanu said pressing issues affecting the sector should be urgently addressed to prevent industrial action, which may disrupt learning.He also lamented overcrowding in most public schools and called on the government to address the trend.
 
Using CMS Grammar School as a role model he said, “we treat our teachers well as well as train them yearly. A large amount of money is constantly allocated for this purpose and it is sponsored by the Old Grammarians’ Society (OGS), old boys of the school. We reward best teachers yearly with a cash price of 1.5million and give all teachers gifts during festive periods. The standard of the school is way higher than what is found in most schools in the state,” he said.The Principal, Sunday Sofekun said the school has prioritise safety of its students by putting in place adequate security measures.
 
Sofekun said on a regular basis, successful members of the OGS are called upon to educate the students as well as guide them in their areas of studies and aspirations.He hailed the alumni body for their constant support to the school.
