 JAMB Center  Eche, 19, allegedly engaged some fraudsters through Facebook and Whatsapp platforms, having come across an advertisement that claimed to upgrade 2019 JAMB results. The arrested candidate, who fell for the trick, quickly contacted the numbers and requested that his scores be upgraded from 153 to 200, but they later settled for 290. After transferring some monies to the scammers, he then wrote a letter to JAMB informing them that they made a mistake in his scores earlier released and that he scored 290. He also sent copies of the forged result to JAMB office results, which upon investigation, was found to be fake.
