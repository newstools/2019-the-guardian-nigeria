Senate Leader and anointed candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) for the plum job in the incoming Ninth National Assembly, Ahmed Lawan, has maintained that the rancour between the legislature and the executive arms of government was unnecessary, as it does not confer independence on the legislature. Speaking over the weekend at his campaign office in Abuja, he clarified that a cordial relationship between the duo does not either make the lawmakers rubber stamps.He stated: “Asserting the independence of the legislature is to pass the laws that are required and insist on implementation. “In the process, when you disagree, you have to find a solution and finding a solution does not necessary mean to go out to throw stones.”We can disagree and argue against the position of the government but at the end of the day, let there be optimal performance on both sides and Nigerians would be better for it.” The Yoke-born legislator observed that one of their major tasks was to ensure warm ties for optimal performance for the benefit of their constituents. On the raging unfriendliness between the executive and the legislature branches of government, he submitted that since both were at centre of governance, they must unite to deliver the dividends of democracy to the people. He went on: “We have been saying that one of our main interests will be to ensure that we unite ourselves in the National Assembly. “But the next very important interest would be to have a relation with the executive arm of government that is based on mutual respect. “That relationship must be characterised by cooperation, collaboration, partnership, synergy and we believe that this is possible because it has happened sometimes before. “There was a time between 2007 and 2011 when the relationship between the Senate and the executive arm of government was cordial and made things happen.”According to him, cordiality does not preclude disagreements, as the legislature was positioned to oversight the executive.
