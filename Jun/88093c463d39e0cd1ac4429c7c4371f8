   Donning black attires, the women were unsparing of the state government and security operatives, whom they alleged, had not been proactive in arresting the situation. Some of them who spoke to The Guardian on condition of anonymity, stated that the protest was necessitated by the “ongoing killings of our men by the Tiv militias, which our king, government and security operatives seem unbothered about.” Reeling out figures of their men and youths allegedly murdered in the last two weeks, they called on the Federal Government to urgently come to their aid by deploying additional security personnel to the area. Since the eruption of the recent violence in Kante village of Wukari council area between the Tiv and Jukun ethnic groups which led to wanton destruction of lives and property, the state as observed by The Guardian had not know peace as the gladiators keep killing one another secretly. Besides forcing motorists to seek alternative routes, the menace has also affected economic activities adversely in the area. The ripple effect being the relocation of business owners to adjourning settlements.In a swift reaction, the President General of Tiv Social Cultural Association, Chief Goodman Dahida, exonerated his ethnic nationality of the allegations, stating that “the Tiv are peace-loving people. We did not kill anybody as claimed by the women and we shall never indulge in such act. “ He noted that his leadership had mapped out plans to engage in peace process “because our people are the one at the receiving end.  Our people are being killed on a daily basis.  We have been displaced.” Contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the state, David Misal, said: “I am not aware of any protest in Donga,” adding that “rather than accusing the police, the people should be applauding us because the commissioner has deployed enough policemen to the areas. “ To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
