Blending afro-pop with sultry grooves, Black Sheep showcases Philip’s versatility and unveils his inner essence, that of a true singer-songwriter. The interludes “Beautiful Woman” and “Black Sheep” are rooted in a minimalist approach, while “Won’t Regret” and “The Making” carry richer soundscapes that are equally appealing. Philip might be an underground heartthrob today, but Black Sheep stands to take him to the next level. Philip is making some major moves, Black Sheep is the singer’s latest project. The 4 track EP also boasts collaboration from Flames.
