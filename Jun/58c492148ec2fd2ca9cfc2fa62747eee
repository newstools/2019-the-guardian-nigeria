A High Court sitting in Kano Thursday adjourned further hearing a suit instituted by the Kano Emirate kingmakers against Governor Umar Ganduje and seven others over the creation of four new Emirates in Kano State. The plaintiffs’ counsel Lateef Fagbemi (SAN) and the defence counsel, Ibrahim Muktar both agreed on the adjournment of the petition against Ganduje, the Kano State House of Assembly, the Attorney General and four others till July 16th. The presiding Judge, Justice Ahmed Tijjani Badamosi then adjourned the case till July 16th for further hearing. Kano Kingmakers are aggrieved by the decision of Governor Ganduje to create four new emirates- Gaya, Rano, Bichi and Karaye in order to decentralise the main Kano Emirate led by Emir Sanusi Lamido Sanusi. Ganduje’s decision to sign the Kano State Emirs Appointment and Deposition Amendment 2019 bill into law sparked public outrage, with many alleging it was plotted to reduce Lamido’s influence in Kano Emirate. An order by Kano State High Court asked Ganduje to suspend the appointment of the new emirs. But Ganduje explained that the appointment of the emirs preceded the court order as he proceeded to inaugurate the new emirs. However, Ganduje clarified that the creation of the new Emirates and inauguration of the emirs was not to spite Lamido but is in adherence to the people’s demands. He opined that it will allow further development in the state. “The creation of the additional Emirates will allow us to re-examine history. This is not something new in Kano, it has happened before. “We created Emirates based on the aspirations and yearnings of our people. I am sure this development will lead to rapid development in the affected areas,” Ganduje said. The governor noted that the new Emirates had been gazetted, hence cannot be reversed.
