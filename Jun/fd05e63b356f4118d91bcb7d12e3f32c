Ushafa Village, Abuja No less than N500 billion is required to resettle the original inhabitants in 13 villages within Abuja City, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) administration has said. It also stated that poor funding is part of the reasons for stalled infrastructure development of some of the districts that have been earmarked in phases 2,3 and 4 of the Federal Capital City. This disclosure was made at the weekend by the Executive Secretary, Federal Capital Development Authority  (FCDA), Umar Jibrin in Enugu during a media retreat. Represented by Richard Dauda, the Executive Secretary noted that the issue of resettlement of original Inhabitants and their compensation was among the challenges that have stalled the proper planning and successful implementation of the Abuja project in accordance with the master plan. He revealed that the N500 billion was needed for provision of engineering infrastructure and compensation of  the villages within phases II, III and partly IV of the city, where a total population of 213,046 people live in a land area of 673.20 hectares spread around 15 districts, which have engineering  infrastructure projects.
