The singer, who is the first brand ambassador for Star, beat fellow nominees Teni, Makanaki, Mr Eazi to win the category. In his absence, his mum and manager, Bose Ogulu, who in her acceptance speech said the message from Burna to every black person is to “remember you were Africans before you became anything else.” Right from his early stage in the industry, Burna Boy showed sparks of creativity; he stepped out with a different vibe that easily endeared him to music fans. However, credit must go her mother, who stepped into the gap to ensure he gets all needed media exposure. On the other hand, his grand father Benson Idonije, renowned music critic, who was first manager of Fela, also put in words to get Burna Boy on limelight. But unlike some, who depended on hype, talent saw Burna Boy through. Though he had been playing gigs in the country, especially within Port Harcourt axis where he stayed upon his return from London, Burna Boy’s first major outing was on March 11, 2012, when he opened for Grammy award winning American artiste Bobby Brown, at the Polo Club, Port Harcourt. The gig, which featured other notable Nigerian artistes such as 2Baba, Banky W, Modenine and others, was an opportunity for Burna Boy to showcase himself on a big stage. With his single Wombolobo, he left nobody in doubt of his musical ability. Today, the rest is history. The International Act category has honoured previous African winners, who have gone on to trailblazer Africa’s culture proudly and become recognisable worldwide for their talent from Nigeria’s 2face and D’banj in 2011 and Wizkid in 2017, Ghana’s Sarkodie and Stonebwoy in 2012 and 2015 respectively and South Africa’s Black Coffee in 2016.
