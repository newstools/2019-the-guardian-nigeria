The African Union on Thursday suspended Sudan, demanding a civilian-led transition authority to resolve a crisis which has claimed over 100 lives. “The AU Peace and Security Council has with immediate effect suspended the participation of the Republic of Sudan in all AU activities until the effective establishment of a Civilian-led Transitional Authority, as the only way to allow Sudan to exit from the current crisis,” the AU posted on Twitter. Sudanese authorities have admitted dozens of people were killed when security forces stormed a weeks-long sit-in outside the military headquarters in Khartoum. But doctors said Wednesday that 40 bodies had been pulled from the Nile, sending the death toll soaring to at least 108. The military ousted longtime president Omar al-Bashir in April after months of protests against his authoritarian rule. But thousands of demonstrators had remained camped out in front of the army headquarters calling for the generals to cede power to civilians. The AU had urged the generals to ensure a smooth transition of power, but the brutal crackdown to disperse protesters Monday saw pressure mount on the AU to hold those responsible for the violence to justice.
