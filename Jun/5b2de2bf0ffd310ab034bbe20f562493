While the Lagos State government is still brooding over resuscitating the monthly environmental sanitation, residence of Igbobi Sabe and its environs were surprised to see similar exercise being carried out by members of the Playmate Royal Club on Saturday. They cleared the drainage blocked with refuse, cut grasses, swept and packed the refuse into disposable bags for proper disposal. The exercise, which started from Igbobi Sabe, Onayade street to Ijaoye roundabout stretching to Oweh Street, Lawal Street, and Abimbola Street took over four hours.
 
Chairman BoT, Mate Awonuga Olatunbosun, said many of their members grew up and had their early lives in the area, which is why they are giving back to the community through the cleanup to ensure a disease-free environment. Mate Abayomi Badmus, Vice President of the club, stressed the need for a cleaner environment, adding that floods were caused by blocked drainage and improper disposal of refuse. “There is need for an awareness for cleaner environment, where we are free from germs, diseases and illnesses. Charity must begin at home. Reason we are starting from the community that groomed many of us. We are also using this to sensitize the young ones to embrace cleanliness.” Mr. Yinka Olawale Akeem, CDA chairman of the area, thanked the club for cleaning the community. He urged them not to stop with the sanitation, but to also bring social amenities that can benefit youths in the community.
