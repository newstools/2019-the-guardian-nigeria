• One killed as suspected herdsmen rape university student to coma in Plateau
Six persons have been reported dead and about 30 others on danger list after inhaling generating set fume while attending a marriage ceremony in Umuomumu community of Mbaitoli local council, Imo State. The victims who were guests at the traditional marriage were evacuated from the celebrant’s house in an unconscious state. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Orlando Ikeokwu, said: “At about 8:00a.m. today (yesterday) one Herbert Uzoegbu reported that his brother, Raymond Uzoegbu, hosted the traditional wedding of his daughter on Sunday, which eventually lasted till late at night, that he went to check on the said brother this morning at about 7:00a.m. only to discover that they were still indoors. He knocked but no one answered. “He broke into the house and discovered that everyone in the house were unconscious. He immediately alerted the police, a team of policemen led by the Divisional Police Officer, CSP Godwin Udom, arrived the scene and evacuated all the victims to the hospital, where it was discovered that six have already given up the ghost with about 23 others unconscious”. The Commissioner of Police, Rabiu Ladodo, has ordered a full-scale investigation into the incident with a view to unraveling the misery behind the tragedy. In another development, there was pandemonium late Sunday night till the early hours of yesterday in Plateau State University, Bokkos, when suspected herders broke into the school and raped a-300 level female student, leaving her unconscious. It was gathered that security operatives, who came for her rescue, also shot and killed a 100-level student, who colleagues said was fired while running in the ensuing melee. The incident resulted in a violent protest on Monday as students barricaded major entrances to the institution and barred staff from gaining entrance into the school. A student, who pleaded anonymity, said: “I don’t stay on campus but I live very close. It was around 10:00p.m. I got a call that some unknown persons came and raped a student in the hostel and left her unconscious. “The security attached to the school went to rescue the girl and on getting there, they asked people to lie down but the guy they killed did not lie down, he was fired as he was running and was rushed to the hospital where he was confirmed dead. The girl that was raped is a 300-level student of Economics department, the one that was killed was in 100-level Geography.” Meanwhile, the Public Relations Officer of the institution, John Agam in a statement said, “the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Yohana Izam, has confirmed the incident of an attack on one of its female hostels by suspected hoodlums on Sunday night. The incident has also left a 100-level Student of Geography in the institution dead after sustaining gunshot injuries. “The Vice Chancellor regrets the demise of the promising young man particularly after a successful matriculation held at the university last Friday. Prof. Izam on behalf of the university community extends the deepest sympathy of management to the deceased parents.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
