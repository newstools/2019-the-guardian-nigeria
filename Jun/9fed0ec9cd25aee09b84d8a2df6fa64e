Former rivals Drake and Chris Brown have officially released their new song, “No Guidance” few days after teasing fans about their collaboration. The song, which will appear on Brown’s new album Indigo, marks the first time the pair have appeared on a track together since Nicki Minaj’s “Only.” They put an end to their longstanding beef last fall when Drake brought Brown out to perform with him at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Indigo, which also features collaborations with Justin Bieber, Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne and H.E.R., will be released on June 28. Listen to “No Guidance” below.
