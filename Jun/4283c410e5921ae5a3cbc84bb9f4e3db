It was stress, I missed balls I never would miss in practice. I will learn from it.” Next up for Swiatek is the grasscourt season, but first a return to the classroom beckons. “I have six tests to take before the grass season and then I will graduate next year.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
