 ikeja Electricity  Many conclusions of arguments or positions about the inefficiency in the Nigerian power sector often times, refer to the faulty process in the initial unbundling of the sector through the privatisation of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) in November 2013.
  
Last weekend, the former chairman of the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), Sam Amadi reiterated the point saying the privatisation of the power sector was designed to fail.  The MAP regulation
The MAP Regulation was unveiled in March last year, with the aim of fast-tracking the roll-out of meters through the engagement of third-party investors for the financing, procurement, supply, installation, and maintenance of electricity meters.
    
It introduced a new set of service providers in the power sector, called meter asset providers, to assist the distribution companies in bridging the huge metering gap in the Nigerian electricity supply industry.
   
According to the regulation, the distribution licensees (Discos) and the MAPs shall enter into a metering service agreement, which shall provide for the number of meters to be installed in the distribution licensee’s network over an agreed period and the recovery of the cost of meter asset plus a reasonable return over a period of 10 years, among others.  Discos’ progress on MAP and endless wait for meters
Though the Commission directed that the rollout of meters shall commence no later than the 1st of May 2019, implementation is far from reality.
   
In Lagos, consumers under the Ikeja Electricity Distribution Company (IEDC) have lamented the slow pace of the company in implementing the MAP scheme even when they were willing to pay for the meter.
  
Some of the consumers who spoke with The Guardian, said the company preferred to issue pre-paid meters to households with existing debts so that recovery could be easily done when credit units are procured, adding that for other households without debts, accessing pre-paid meters has become a racket for which residents pay up to N100,000 to fast-track the issuance of three-phase meters that shouldn’t cost N67,055.85 according to NERC guidelines.
