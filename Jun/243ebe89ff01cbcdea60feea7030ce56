The announcement comes after Spain prime minister Pedro Sanchez proposed in November a venture along with the north African country. Lisbon and Madrid have changed their position to focus on a bid without the Moroccans. The two countries had also looked at hosting the tournament in 2018 as well as in 2022. The South American quartet of Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay and Chile, European trio Greece, Romania and Serbia as well as the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland have said they would like to stage the tournament too. The final decision on the hosts will be made in 2022.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
