Egypt’s decision to recall Amr Warda is not siting pretty with the country’s women, who have accused the government of condoning violence against women. The Egypt FA (EFA) sent the 25-year-old Paok Salonika midfielder out of the national team camp, citing disciplinary reasons, which was later revealed to be sexually related. Warda, who later apologized to his family, friends and colleagues on a video posted on twitter,  had such influential figures as Mohamed Salah and Trezeguet interceding for him. The Guardian learnt that EFA President, Hani Abu Reda, the Sports Minister, Dr. Ashraf Subhi and the team met on Thursday on the issue among other things affecting the team. The EFA  in a statement after the meeting said: “Hani Abu Reda praised the spirit of solidarity between the players, their desire to pardon their colleague Amr Warda and to lift the suspension from him, and their commitment to any decision issued by the football association in this regard. “He decided to reduce the penalty of suspension until the end of the first round of the tournament only.” The development means Warda would be available for selection from the knock out stage, but the women do not find it funny. Some of the women have called on the Pharaohs’ female supporters to boycott their matches to show their displeasure with the society, which seems to condone sexual harassment of Egyptian women.
