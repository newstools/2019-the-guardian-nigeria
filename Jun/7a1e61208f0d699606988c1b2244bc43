Hollywood star Cuba Gooding Jr. has been arrested and charged with a misdemeanour after a 29-year old woman filed a police report claiming the Oscar winner grabbed her breast at Magic Hour Rooftop Bar & Lounge in Manhattan on Sunday. Gooding Jr. voluntarily surrendered to the NYPD for questioning on Thursday, CNN reports. His attorney Mark Heller, in a press conference, said his client has been cooperative with police, adding that he’s analysed more than 2 hours of video from the night and nothing shows Gooding Jr. commit a crime.

Gooding was charged with a misdemeanour count of forcible touching for allegedly groping a woman at a night club. | Photo: TMZ Gooding Jr. has also denied the claims, calling on his fans to trust the system to exonerate him. A law enforcement source told CNN that the victim said she was with friends when she was confronted by a male patron whom she described as Gooding Jr. “The male allegedly groped her breasts. The victim later told cops she protested at the unwanted touching and they argued about the encounter,” the source added. The woman called 911 and reported the incident. However, a new video has surfaced from what appears to be security footages from within the club which shows how and where the incident occurred.  The scene also includes an unknown man (not Gooding) who approaches the three figures believed to be Gooding, De Niro and the accuser, and starts grinding his crotch in their faces. Heller said Gooding’s legal team watched the entire video and he still maintains he saw nothing inappropriate on the part of Gooding. The accuser has not spoken publicly to the media about what she says happened to her, and it is not clear whether she has an attorney or a representative to speak for her.
