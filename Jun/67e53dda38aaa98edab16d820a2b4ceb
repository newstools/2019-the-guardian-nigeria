A foundation whose mission is to improve the standard of education in government-owned schools has put smiles on the faces of about a thousand pupils by providing uniforms to them. The Bankole Thomas Foundation (BTF), an offshoot of the popular Bankole Thomas, a men’s fashion brand, gave 900 uniforms to pupils of Anthony Model School, Kosofe; St. John Primary School, Arolaya, Lagos Island; and Unity Primary School, Amuwo Odofin.
  
A representative of the foundation said the inspiration behind this feat was to combat the rising rate of out-of-school children in Nigeria who drop out of school for seemingly simple things like uniforms and school materials. “Young pupils are out of school for a number of reasons, this is why this foundation is working in every way possible to reduce this number. Nigeria is ranked as having the highest number of out of school children in the world and a recent UNICEF survey has shown that the population of out of school children in Nigeria has risen from 10.5 million to 13.2 million.”
   
He went on to add that they want to focus on improving children’s self esteem, emotional wellbeing as well as aid learning.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
