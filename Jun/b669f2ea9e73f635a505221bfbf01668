Several spotkicks have been retaken at the tournament in France after goalkeepers were ruled by VAR to have left their lines, prompting widespread criticism of the new rule. On Friday, Germany coach Voss-Tecklenburg called the rule “stupid” and “senseless”. “It just makes football more complicated,” she said ahead of her side’s last 16 clash with Nigeria on Saturday. “We may as well just tie goalkeepers legs together so they can’t move at all,” she said.

Will every penalty have to be retaken?” Voss-Tecklenburg’s comments came ast the International Football Association Board (IFAB) granted a temporary dispensation to suspend the yellow cards during shootouts at the World Cup. Voss-Tecklenburg welcomed the development, saying that it would ease the pressure on goalkeepers. Pierluigi Collina, chairman of FIFA’s refereeing committee, defended the change to the rules on Friday, saying the change had been designed to help goalkeepers, who would previously have had to keep both feet on the line. “Since the change, their job is definitely easier than before,” he said.
