A protest by students of Ekiti State University, (EKSU), Ado Ekiti, has forced management to postpone the first semester examinations which were originally scheduled to begin on Monday, June 17. In a news release issued on Sunday night and signed by the Registrar of the institution, Mr Akin Arogundade, the new date for the examinations is now Monday, July 1. The postponement according to the statement is to ensure security of lives and property on campus and its environs. It failed to dwell on the effect of an earlier protest by students as possible cause of the shift. “Consequently, all academic activities on campus has been postponed until Monday July 1, 2019, while students are expected back on campus on Sunday, June 30, 2019,” the statement said. It directed all students preparing for exams to ensure payment of all necessary  fees, as evidence of payment would be used for clearance and examination permit. ” The University community, parents, and guardians  are assured of adequate security on campus as well as the safety of staff and students,” it said. NAN recalls that the students held a peaceful protest early on Sunday to criticise the sudden fixing of the examinations without adequate lectures. The protesters were also worried that many students might be denied participation as the data system had yet to capture all who had cleared their tuition.
