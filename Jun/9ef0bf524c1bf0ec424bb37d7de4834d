 Super Eagles’ Manager, Gernot Rohr.PHOTO: AFP.  Speaking from the Eagles’ training camp in Alexandria, Rohr said the players he has in his squad could match any of the other top stars at the competition, stressing that all the teams are in Egypt to fight for glory. “The Super Eagles are ready to face any opponent in Egypt. My major target now is to get the team to work as a unit and be psychologically prepared to win the first game against Burundi. “Winning the first game at the AFCON is very important for the Eagles because it would instill more confidence on the players.”
He said the fact that 15 of the players in his team are making their debut at the Nations Cup is a plus, as they want to show that they can mix with the big boys. “Apart from playing at the 2018 World Cup, they have not had any other big tournament experience and the Nations Cup requires a different approach. “However, beating Burundi in the first game will help stabilize the team, but we are aware that at this point every team wants to establish its supremacy in the first game and so Burundi will not be an easy task.”Rohr is buoyed by the fact his team has not lost any game since the World Cup, apart from the friendly game against Senegal, adding, “We hope to keep this going in the AFCON.” Although he has confidence in his boys’ ability to scale the first round, he is worried that most of the teams in their group are relatively unknown and would come with an element of surprise against the Eagles.Nigeria is in the same group with Burundi, Madagascar and Guinea. Rohr said his major target is to ensure the Eagles win their group’s opening game on Saturday against Burundi, adding that the team has been working hard in training to ensure they are ready for Saturday.
