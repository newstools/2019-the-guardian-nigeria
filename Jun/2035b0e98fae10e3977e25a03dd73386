PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday upbraided President Muhammadu Buhari over his comment in which he branded residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja as ‘necessary evil’ for not voting for him in the February 23 Presidential election. In a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, the opposition party noted that calling Nigerians necessary evil for exercising their rights was completely unbecoming of a President and should be condemned by all. The PDP lamented that the President’s comment was inciting, divisive and capable of demonising innocent citizens and setting them up for victimisation by overzealous security agencies. “Moreover, Buhari should note that he was not only rejected by the FCT residents but by majority of Nigerians, who voted massively for the PDP, only for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to subvert their will. “This subversion of the people’s will in his favour is the reason our party and its Presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, headed for the tribunal to retrieve the stolen mandate,” the statement added. It also criticised President Buhari for saying that to make the FCT secure is to make himself and the Vice President secure, insisting that it was his duty to provide security for the entire country, irrespective of where he and the Vice President reside or how Nigerians voted. The PDP maintained that the security of all Nigerians ought to be paramount to the President and not determined by inessential factors, if indeed he has the interest of the people at heart.It, therefore, urged President Buhari to apologise to Nigerians for the divisive comment.
