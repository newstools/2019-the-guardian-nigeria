In 2013, Ese Walter, found the spotlight on her when she accused Abuja pastor and founder of the Commowealth of Zion Assembly (COZA), Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo of sexual exploitation whilst she was a member of the church. We reported earlier that Nigerian singer, Timi Dakolo some few days ago took to social media to allege that a certain Pastor in COZA has been sexually abusing church members with some elders in the church helping with the cover-up. Following this expose, some Nigerians in their reactions have been dragging Walter into the current scandal but she has now taken to her Facebook page to appeal to Nigerians not to drag her into the scandal. According to her, she played the victim role until she turned 35. Read what she wrote below, “Allow me to reintroduce myself.

 My name is Ese Walter. FIRST of her name. I am an author (and all-round writer), self-taught yogi (currently about a yoga teacher’s training so I can teach you safely) and mother (Boobbabies is the nickname for my children, Boobman and Boobgirl)
 .
 .
 What you have just read above is what I am consistently creating for myself at this moment. I am currently on a 90 days, habit building, ACTION plan to become the highest expression of myself in these roles I play.
 .
 .
 I am not your poster girl for any trending stories, I am not a victim of anything (although I played this victim role for years until 35 hit ) and finally, I am not open to your discussions about my past. If you choose to live there, be my guest, just quit your attempts to pull me along with ya The tongue photo is actually for you

 Lastly, if you have not healed from your pain, hurting others will not heal you. Trust, I know. Plus, your pain is here to teach you. It is here to bring out the fire in you. It is that fire that propels you in the direction of your dreams (I am assuming you have dreams…if you don’t, ain’t no shame, sit with yourself and build one)

 This sounds like a new month Motivation

 Good morning from here.” It would be recalled that after Dakolo made the allegation, he took to social media again to reveal that some Christians have been in his direct message to threaten him for the callout of the unnamed COZA pastor for sexual abuse of church members.
