• Says He Left Brand New Govt House
• I Met Decayed Govt House, Says Ihedioha The immediate past Imo State Governor, Rochas Okorocha, has urged Nigerians not to take the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) administration in the state, led by Chief Emeka Ihedioha, serious, accusing the new governor of feeding the public with lies. Ihedioha told journalists on Friday, after a facility tour of the Government House, Owerri, that he met infrastructure, which needed to be fixed, saying it would not deter him and his team from delivering democracy dividend to the people. But in a statement, yesterday, Okorocha’s Special Adviser (Media), Sam Onwuemeodo expressed disappointment in Ihedioha for not appreciating the new Government House his boss built with facilities.  He said: “The new government in Imo State, with Chief Emeka Ihedioha as governor, has taken off with a series of lies and has also shown that it is allergic to the truth, and should not, therefore, be believed or taken serious by Nigerians of goodwill. He said Okorocha left behind a brand new Government House with new Governors’ Lodge that is not up to three years.
