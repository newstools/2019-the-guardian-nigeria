Immediate past Nigeria’s state for petroleum resources minister Ibe Kachikwu Monday denied saying President Muhammadu Buhari failed Nigerians by not building refinery as promised. “There is nowhere the former Minister blamed or inferred that the Buhari administration failed Nigerians for not building refineries,” Kachikwu said in a statement. “While the purpose of this misinformation is still unclear, it is pertinent to state unequivocally that the sensational headlines are a gross misrepresentation of the statement of the former Minister.” The former minister, however, said the reports were misleading with sensational headlines the media outlets titled. Kachikwu explained that he only expressed his wish to have “achieved the Refinery upgrade for Nigerians and that I tried but at the end of the day NNPC owns the refineries and led the negotiations for Private Sector support funding and once they could not obtain the right funding terms there was nothing I could do.” He stated that “the President is passionate about fixing the refineries and in this term, this will be a priority item and handled at a ministerial level.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
