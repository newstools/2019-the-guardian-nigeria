 Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS)  “This singular realisation that gaming/gambling is prohibited by some religions and other factors led to the placement of gaming regulation in the Residual List of the Constitution.
   
“As such, states that permit gaming have the inherent constitutional right to regulate gaming.  ASGRN  is  therefore calling on  NLRC  to  understand that  legally,  its  regulatory  power  only covers the ambit of the Federal Capital Territory and setting up a viable National Lottery to challenge  what  is  currently available  in  other countries along  the West African  Sub-region.”The body further disclosed that Ghana Lotto for instance is very popular in Nigeria and asked why Nigeria cannot float a similar lottery?”
   
Reacting to the news that the States were making arrangements to float another body charged with the responsibility of issues regarding gaming taxes and licensing of gaming operators, Ogara said: “In   fullness   of   time   and   after   all   due   diligence   and   consultations   have   been concluded, we intend to establish a Joint Gaming Board (JGB) (one of the outcomes of the roundtable discussions between the States and NLRC), whose duty will be to harmonise and design a unified tax regime among the regulating states. On the issue of licenses, we shall leave it for the respective states to decide.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
