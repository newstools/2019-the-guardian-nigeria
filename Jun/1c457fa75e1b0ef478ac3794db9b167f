 Comptroller General of Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Mohammed Babadede  Dede revealed that the new development would enable the Nigerian government to fish out illegal immigrants residing in the country, insisting whoever failed to conform to the directive risked deportation. He said this during the graduation ceremony of 396 Immigration Officers that undertook the 44th Superintendent Basic Course at Kano Immigration Training School, adding that the renewed issuance became pertinent due to insecurity confronting the nation.

He said in the face of global reality, coupled with insurgency and other serious security threats, Nigeria must take necessary steps in protecting its sovereignty for citizens to go about their lawful business in peace.
