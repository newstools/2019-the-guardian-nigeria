Shortly after releasing her “MEGATRON” single and its dancehall-infused video, Queens rapper Nicki Minaj returned to the airwaves with a brand new episode of Queen Radio. The last episode aired more than three months ago, shortly before the rapper went on a social media break. Since then, there has been several rumors about Nicki’s much-anticipated fifth studio album. Minutes into the episode, Nicki announced she was rescinding the “cock sucker of the day” award given to Irving Azoff, Travis Scott’s manager. After her Queen album debuted at No. 2 behind Scott’s ASTROWORLD, Nicki Minaj claimed the only reason Scott surpassed her was because his girlfriend, Kylie Jenner, promoted it. She later took aim at Scott’s manager, claiming he launched a smear campaign against her. On this episode, Nicki announced she and Azoff have buried the hatchet and that he is now her manager. The rapper then opened up about her ongoing issues with the Grammys. She claimed that moments before her 2012 performance, Grammy officials told her they didn’t want her to take the stage in wake of Whitney Houston’s death. Nicki said she didn’t understand the reasoning. “Even then it made absolutely no sense […] This is after I had done a bunch of commercials with L.L. Cool J to promote the Grammys,” she said. “After I did everything they asked, they told me not to perform. I said, ‘No I’m going to perform.” Nicki said her refusal to back out of the show prompted Grammy producer Ken Ehrlich to blackball her. She then briefly addressed her beef with Miley Cyrus. “Perdue chickens can never talk shit about queens,” she said about the singer. “She disrespected me in a magazine article for no reason. I had just seen her after she sucked Mike Will’s dick in the studio.” Listen to full new episode of Queen Radio below; https://itunes.apple.com/us/curator/queen-radio/1391364917?app=music&ign-itsct=cur_nickiminaj_queen_null&ign-itscg=80029
