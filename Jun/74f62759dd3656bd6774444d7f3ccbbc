Former Nigeria aviation minister and chieftain of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Femi Fani-Kayode Wednesday threatened to move motion for the separation of southwest states from Nigeria. “On August 2nd 1958 my father, Chief Remi Fani-Kayode, successfully moved the motion for Nigeria’s independence from British colonial rule,” Fani-Kayode tweeted. “If the Fulanisation and Islamisation agenda continues I shall move the motion for Oduduwa’s (Osun, Oyo, Ogun, Ekiti, Ondo and Lagos state) independence from Nigerian colonial rule.” Fani-Kayode, a staunch critic of the current Nigeria government was not the first person to link the insecurity in the country to the Islamisation and Fulanisation agenda on Nigeria. Former president Olusegun Obasanjo in May made the allegation but did not call for the separation of any parts of the country from Nigeria. Obasanjo said Nigeria’s challenge has moved beyond “an issue of lack of education and lack of employment for our youths in Nigeria which it began as,” Obasanjo said. “It is now West African Fulanisation, African Islamisation and global organised crimes of human trafficking, money laundering, drug trafficking, gun trafficking, illegal mining and regime change.” Obasanjo’s claim was backed by notable bodies in the country including the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and prof Wole Soyinka who hardly agrees with the former president. “However, everybody knows that my relationship with Obasanjo is not too cordial but at the same time, we should be very careful not to be dismissive. If there is a substance, the language must be put aside for a moment,” Soyinka said. “This country is under going a horrendous descent into the abyss. The perfect picture of Africa is what we must continue to uphold in view as leaders have used the word ‘unity’ to destroy our people.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
