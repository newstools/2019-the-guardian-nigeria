 MKO Abiola  At the event to celebrate Abiola, tagged: “June 12: Hope 1993 and Prospects of Democratic Prosperity and Political Stability in Nigeria,” the convener of the event, Mr. Wale Okuniyi, noted that the state of the stadium was worrisome and should be given a befitting renovation to honour the late Abiola. “Naming the National Stadium after Abiola is a fantastic step, but beyond that, his picture should appear alongside the other presidents in Aso Rock. The stadium being named after Abiola is not in good condition, it is worrisome. The Federal Government should do something about it if it wants to name it after him,” he said. Also, the immediate past senator representing Kaduna Central in the National Assembly, Shehu Sani, described Abiola as a ‘pillar of sports. He said: “Renaming the National Stadium Abuja after Chief MKO Abiola is a great honour and commendable. Abiola was a pillar of sports; he deserves it. This should also be an opportunity to renovate and refurbish the arena that was so long in decrepit state.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
