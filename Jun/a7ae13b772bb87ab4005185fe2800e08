It didn’t produce what I wanted, it didn’t go as I hoped,” said the 27-year-old, who joined Barca for a reported 160 million euros in January 2018. “But I hope it serves me as an example, as a lesson so that I want more, concentrate even more to be able to succeed.” Coutinho scored in Brazil’s opening 3-0 Group A victory over Bolivia, was pretty anonymous in their 0-0 draw with Venezuela but then played his best game yet in the 5-0 thrashing of Peru. “Here with the national team there’s always the same responsibility: showing the right commitment to be able to play,” he said. “Whether a good or bad season, it doesn’t change anything: the desire to win is always the same, or maybe even more so.” Coutinho has scored just 13 La Liga goals since joining Barca and was confined to the substitutes bench a few times last season. Meanwhile, in his absence, Liverpool won the Champions League last month. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
