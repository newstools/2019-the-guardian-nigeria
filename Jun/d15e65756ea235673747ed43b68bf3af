 [FILES] Imo APC Governorship Aspirant, Uche Nwosu.<br />Photo: Twitter/ Ugwumba Uche Nwosu  This followed the outcome of what transpired at the Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Owerri, yesterday. Okey Ehieze, counsel to AA in the suit instituted by Nwosu against Emeka Ihedioha and INEC in his motion distanced the party from the matter. He told the court that the party was never informed by the plaintiffs, Nwosu about joining it as second petitioner/applicant to the suit and urged the court to strike out the party in the matter. Earlier on, Ehieze and Adeniyi Akintola had battled over who should represent the party in the suit. While Akintola tried to convince the tribunal that he was representing Uche Nwosu and Action Alliance, Ehieze said he was not a gatecrasher and was validly appointed via a letter dated May 27, 2019 and signed by the National Legal Adviser of the party, Anaukyaa Mnenge Peter Esq. Ehieze also informed the Court that the decision to strike out the name of the second petitioner/applicant from this petition, was not actuated by any other reason, other than in keeping with its agreement with other members of the Coalition of United Political Parties, the National Legal Adviser also stated that its position is not to undermine the interest of its members, as well as to give room for peace, progress and development of the state. He therefore urged the tribunal to grant the application by striking out the name of the second petitioner/applicant, (AA) as sought. Reacting to the development, counsel to Governor Ihedioha and the PDP, Onyechi Ikpeazu and Prince Ken Njemanze respectively urged the tribunal to hear Ehiezeâ€™s motion on notice and take a decision on it. The matter was later adjourned to June 14, 2019, for continuation. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
