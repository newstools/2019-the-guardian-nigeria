The National Pension Commission (PenCom), has commenced pre-retirement workshop for prospective retirees, who are due to retire in 2020, under the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS).
   
Director-General of the Commission, Mrs. Aisha Dahir-Umar, who was represented by Head, Retirement Benefit Unit, Mohammed Umar, stated this while speaking in Gombe recently.
   
Dahir-Umar said the workshop was necessitated by the need to adequately sensitise prospective retirees on the steps to take towards a hitch-free retirement life.
   
According to her, the verification is scheduled to hold in 15 centres across the country on a date to be fixed later.
   
“It is our hope that the workshop would inform participants on what they need to know on documentation requirements, payment of retirement benefits and best ways to enjoy life in retirement,” she said.
   
She commended all stakeholders, noting that the achievements recorded by the Commission in the last 16 years would not have been possible without their support and understanding.
   
Also speaking, during the workshop, Mrs. Halima Kyari, Retirement Benefit Advisory of the Commission, said payment of pension was in two folds, and therefore advised prospective retirees to invest the bulk fund properly and judiciously.
   
The issues discussed during the workshop bordered on enrolment exercise and documentation requirements, accessing retirement fund under the Contributory Pension Scheme, and life after retirement. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
