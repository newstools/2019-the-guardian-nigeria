REUTERS/Ognen Teofilovski  “The conditions for extradition, having seen the international arrest warrant and Macedonia’s extradition request, have not been fulfilled,” judge Eva Varhgyi said following a short closed hearing in Budapest. Gruevski, 48, was allowed to walk freely from the courthouse, in a baseball cap and sunglasses. He fled to Hungary in November via Albania, Montenegro and Serbia after being sentenced to two years in prison for using a Macedonia government Mercedes worth some 600,000 euros ($680,000) for personal travel. After Gruevski fled, a special prosecution team appointed to probe alleged crimes committed by his administration, submitted two new charges against him. He was accused of “illegal financing” of his VMRO-DPMNE party and unlawful construction of its headquarters. Gruevski was prime minister of Macedonia from 2006 to 2016 and is a friend of Hungarian premier Viktor Orban. Gruevski’s downfall came after evidence appeared to show a widespread wire-tapping scheme by his administration In February, he claimed to have fled Macedonia after he heard that he would be killed in prison.
