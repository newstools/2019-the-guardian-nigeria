Residents of Ayetoro Community in Ilaje Local Government Area of Ondo State have appealed to Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu to intervene in the kingship crisis rocking the theocratic community, lamenting that some government officials are stoking the crisis. In a letter of appeal written to the governor yesterday by the Supreme Council of Elders, signed by the Secretary, Mr. Johnson Atimishe, the people pleaded for the release their monarch and Ogeleyinbo of Ayetoro, Oba Oluwambe Ojagbohunmi, from prison. “This is a passionate appeal to the governor to immediately intervene in the leadership crisis rocking Ayetoro community in Ilaje,” the letter read in part. Ojagbohunmi and a former Ambassador of African Development Bank, Micah Ajijo, have been fighting over the succession right to the throne of Ogeleyinbo since February 2015. The monarch, alongside the Baba Ijo and Public Relations Officer of the community, Mr. Lawrence Lemamu and Victor Akinluwa respectively, was arrested and detained at Olokuta Maximum Prison since January. The council lamented that the Ajijo faction, having failed to enjoy the support of the entire community to install himself as the Ogeleyinbo resorted to violence and intimidation of Ayetoro residents.
