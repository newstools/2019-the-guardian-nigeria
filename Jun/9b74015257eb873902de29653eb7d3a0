We took a lot of customers’ feedback into our business strategy, and this led us to take certain strategic decisions, one of which was to suspend the old site so as to effectively redesign a new one from scratch for improved shopping experiences for our customers in order to provide them with top quality products that meet their fashion and lifestyle , he said. Head of Product Management, PGS, Adenike Bankole, said PGS has also partnered with top fashion brands in the world to stock new products. “Our goal is to be the one-stop-shop retail store for urban fashion and lifestyle products in Nigeria and Africa, hence we have made our store available online and offline as well,” she said.
