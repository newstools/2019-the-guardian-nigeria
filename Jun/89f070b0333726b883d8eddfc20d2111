A 12-year-old girl was swept away by flood in Okpanam community of Delta State yesterday after heavy rains, which lasted several hours. Parts of Asaba, the state capital and its environs, were also submerged by flood, including Direct Labour Agency road. Though the identity of the girl was not ascertained as at press time, an eyewitness said the victim, who lives in the Redeemed Church road, unknowingly stepped into an open drain filled with floodwater and got swept off. The busy dualised Okpanam road was taken over by a torrent of muddy waters, causing gridlock. Also, residential buildings along Junior Staff quarter road from Summit road were flooded. The premises of Delta Broadcasting Service (DBS) Asaba were not spared as it was submerged by flood, sacking the workers from their offices. Some of the workers lamented that their offices have been taken over by flood, adding that most of the equipment of the broadcasting station have also been destroyed. They appealed to the state government to expedite action on the storm drainage project as the incessant flooding is hampering the efficiency of the station. Residents of Umueze in Ibusa town of Delta have also called on the Federal Government and the state governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, to come to their rescue and save them from perennial flood, which has rendered them homeless. One of the residents, Ogechukwu Okonkwor, who spoke to The Guardian, noted that the flood was as a result of the NDDC contractor drainage system constructed poorly without proper channeling. According to him, “this bad job is now causing Umueze people so much pain. Many would be rendered homeless if something is not done urgently.” Another resident said: “The contractor must be made to face the law. Things should be done right in Delta. We are tired of shoddy jobs.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
