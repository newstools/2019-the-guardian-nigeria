Chakwera has rejected the outcome as “daylight robbery” and launched a court battle to have the result annulled on the grounds of fraud. The MCP has said there was correction fluid on many election results sheets while some from polling stations far apart bore the same handwriting. “I just call on all parties in Malawi to exercise restraint and proceed peacefully while the MCP court case is going forward,” Palmer, who is due to leave her Malawi posting shortly, said. “This is a peaceful country and a democratic country and we all need to respect these norms.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
