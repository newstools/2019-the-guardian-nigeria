The All Progressive Congress (APC) governorship candidate in the March general elections, Great Ogboru, has extended a message of hope to Deltans in particular, and the Niger Delta in general, saying the emergence of Senator Ovie Omo Agege as the Deputy Senate President is a sign of good things to come for the region. In a statement signed by his media aide, Gibson Akporehe, and made available to The Guardian yesterday, Ogboru stated that his joy over the election and emergence of his ally as deputy speaker speaks volumes. He further admonished the Deputy Senate President, “Not to be circumspect in deploying his iconic talents in using the office to serve all Niger Deltans, who did not witness transformative development under the leadership of conservative politicians when the region unexpectedly by providence had the privilege of occupying the exalted and commanding office of the president for more than six years.” Ogboru commended the national leadership of APC for considering Omo-Agege and encouraged Niger Deltans to see this victory as the beginning of the several victories that will liberate the region.
