Amaju Pinnick, the president of the Nigeria Football Federation, could be set to take over as the acting president of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) after French authorities arrested CAF president Ahmad Ahmad. Ahmad was arrested due to allegations of corruption and financial misappropriation involving a French company, Tactical steel. According to CAF’s bylaws, Pinnick, who is the first vice president, will assume his duties for a transitional period of four months before convening an elective extraordinary meeting. “If the President ceases exercising his functions on a permanent basis the first VicePresident shall assume the presidency, and shall be obliged to convene an Extraordinary General Assembly, in accordance with these Statutes. The Extraordinary General Assembly shall elect a new President, within a period not exceeding four (4)
months from the time the office of President becomes conclusively vacant.” The NFF president was appointed CAF’s first vice president in July 2018 after Kwesi Nyatakyi stepped down following a corruption scandal. Pinnick is also embroiled in his own corruption allegation. Alongside four other, top NFF officials, he has been ordered to appear before a Nigerian court over several charges. They were accused of failing to declare their assets as required law, the alleged misappropriation of US$8.4 million paid to Nigeria for participating in the 2014 World Cup and dishonestly moving N4bn belonging to the NFF.
