 Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi  The governor, who stated this in Ado-Ekiti yesterday while receiving officials of the Security Exchange Commission (SEC) who were in the state to inspect projects that were financed from the N25 billion bond taken by the state government during his first term, said the law would check the wanton abandonment of projects simply because they were not initiated by the incumbent. Specifically, Fayemi stated that most of the projects he initiated during his first term, which impacted positively on the lives of the people, were jettisoned by his successor. He said the law would serve as a guide for any government and stipulate lines of demarcation between what constitutes infractions by way of abandonment of projects and actions that would be of tremendous benefit to the people.
