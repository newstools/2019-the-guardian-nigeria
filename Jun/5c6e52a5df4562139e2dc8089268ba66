Nigerian music star, Omawumi is all about positive vibes only as she has been able to grow a thick skin to ward off the negative energies directed at her over the years. The award-winning songbird in a recent chat with Hip TV, revealed that negative comments no longer have the same effect on her, unlike when she just started her career. She goes on to say that she doesn’t focus on negative comments because they are usually just perceptions and not reality. Speaking about negative energy and how she deals with it, she says, “When I first started years ago, it affects me but now, no it doesn’t. First of all, I don’t even know you, if my papa, my brother/sister or someone I know curses me, it will pain me. But even if I know you, it will still not pain me anyhow. When you say hurtful things about people or spill things about people, it reflects how you see them, it doesn’t reflect how the person sees themselves.” She also talks about her new album, “In Her Feelings” and why she has chosen to dedicate songs to her husband. She says, “Predominantly, ‘In Her Feelings’, is about me in my feelings just expressing myself the way I know how. This time, I wrote a couple of songs because I want it to be as relatable as possible. I just said relatable things people experience in relationships. It is just a good body of work and you won’t be disappointed.” Watch the interview below:  Omawumi who has also been playing more active roles in the Nigerian film industry, Nollywood, recently starred in EbonyLife Films new film, “Oloture” that chronicles the experiences of commercial sex workers in Nigeria as always as human trafficking.
