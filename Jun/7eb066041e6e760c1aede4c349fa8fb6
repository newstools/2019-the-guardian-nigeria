 South African Caster Semenya speaks with journalists after the women’s 2000m race during the France’s LNA (athletics national association) Pro Athle Tour meeting on June 11, 2019 at the Jean-Delbert stadium in Montreuil, a Paris neighbouring suburb. – The double 800m Olympic champion, who was racing for the first time since a controversial new gender ruling came into effect, finished in 5min 38.19sec ahead of Ethiopian pair Hawi Feysa and Adanech Anbesa.

An initial appeal by Semenya was struck down by the Court for Arbitration of Sport in Lausanne, leading to her appeal to the country’s top court. Earlier this week the South African accused the IAAF of using her as a “human guinea pig” as they “experiment with how the medication they required me to take would affect my testosterone levels.” The race on June 30 in the US will be her first race over 800m since winning gold at the Diamond League in Doha on May 4. This month’s meeting has been moved from its usual home in Eugene to California as the stadium in Oregon is being renovated for hosting the 2021 World Championships.
