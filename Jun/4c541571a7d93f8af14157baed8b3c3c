 Abiodun Omoniyi.  “We have 80 per cent of Lagos covered already, and hope to complete the entire state by end of the year. About 18 other states should be completed by 2020.”
   
Omoniyi, who informed that the formal launch of the service will come up in July, said the retail broadband service is being launched to satisfy Nigeria’s insatiable data need. He said VDT is known for the provision of premium quality services to enterprise customers, the retail broadband service space would witness the same premium quality service for homes and individual subscribers in Nigeria.
   
He explained that the opportunity to actualise this dream came with the successful acquisition of a broad channel 2.3GHz Spectrum from the Federal Government through Bitflux Communications Limited; a consortium which VDT is the principal partner.
    
The Guardian recalled that Bitflux Communications Limited had beat Globacom in 2014 to the 2.3GHz spectrum auction organised by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).
  
Omoniyi disclosed that despite the existence of other players in the market, the decision to launch VDT 4G LTE service is owing to the gaps existing in the market due to poor quality networks, customer service and support service inherent in the market.
  
“VDT 4G LTE Advanced has come to fill these yawning gaps with superior network quality, top-notch network performance and proactive customer and support services,” he stressed.
   
The Deputy Managing Director/Chief Operating Officer, Mrs. Bimbo Ikumariegbe, said the new vision is to service Nigerians, who have longed for improve and quality service. Ikumariegbe said the advanced 4G LTE would boost the country’s broadband penetration drive and give the country edge.The Guardian checks showed that about 64 million Nigerians currently enjoy broadband service, which is about 33.7 per cent penetration.
