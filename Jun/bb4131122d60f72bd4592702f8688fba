Ogun State governor Dapo Abiodun has said the state will leverage on its proximity to Lagos State to deepen investments in the state. “Ogun today is like New Jersey to New York,” Abiodun said after he and other All Progressives Congress (APC) governors met with President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja on Tuesday. “We benefitted from what you call the push factor from Lagos.” Abiodun, who stated that one of his agenda was to improve the ease of doing business in the state, said his government will ensure the state is attractive to local and foreign investors. He noted that the vision of the state is “to provide a focused and qualitative governance while creating an enabling environment for private, public sector partnership, which we believe is fundamental to the economic growth of the state and individual prosperity.” The governor listed timely payment of staff salaries, empowerment of local council officials, payment of pensions and gratuities to retired workers as part of his government’s plans. “Ogun is geared for greater heights and we do that by ensuring that good governance is in accordance with our vision,” Abiodun said.
