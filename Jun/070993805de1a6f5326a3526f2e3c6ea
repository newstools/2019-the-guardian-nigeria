The Super Eagles huddling before a recent training session in Alexandria, Egypt. Super Eagles attacker, Ahmed Musa says he derives joy seeing Nigerians happy any time he features for the team. “I always like to make Nigerians jubilate any time I am on international assignment with the Super Eagles,” Musa told The Guardian in an interview at the team’s Helnan Palestine hotel in Alexandria yesterday morning. Many football-loving Nigerians still savour Musa’s goals at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. He said he would do everything to re-enact that performance here in Egypt, adding that he is waiting for the right time to come. “First, I want to be part of history here in Egypt by helping the Super Eagles win the Afcon title. We won it in 2013 in South Africa and we couldn’t qualify for two editions in 2015 and 2017. Now is the time for us to show appreciation to Nigerians for their patience. They should continue to believe in this team. I am very confident we can win the title because we have the team. We operate like members of one big family in the team.” Musa said he could not perform well in the first match against Burundi because the weather affected him. “We came from Europe where the weather is cold. It is hot here. But we are adjusting very fast.” He also spoke on the slim goal margin scored by the Super Eagles in the two matches against Burundi and Guinea. “There are no more minnows in African football. The important thing is the three points in a match. But I am sure the goals will come. Our target is to win the last match against Madagascar and top the group,” he stated.
