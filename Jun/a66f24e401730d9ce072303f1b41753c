Kogi State governor Yahaya Bello Friday declared that no one can stop his re-election for another four years in office. “I am the Governor today and In sha Allah, l will return as the Governor for another four years, after the November 16 election. As for the ticket, the analogy is that the tenant cannot send the landlord out of his house,” Bello told State House Correspondents after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja. “Anytime, any day, we will win elections in a landslide. That l am going to win in the primaries is given by the grace of God, by whichever means, direct or indirect.” Bello, who noted that he rebuilt the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kogi state after the death of former governor Prince Abubakar Audu, said his re-election will be a landslide victory in November. He said the APC members at Kogi State House of Assembly, House of Representatives and two out of the three Senators representing Kogi state in the Senate were a reflection of his work on the party. “You know in Kogi, politics is the loudest, so people must make noise and you can’t stop that. But surely, l am very good with my party from the local government to the national level,” Bello said. “They know that l am the leader of the party in my state. I have built it and it is very strong. Anytime, any day, we will elections in a landslide. That l am going to win in the primaries is given by the grace of God, by whichever means, direct or indirect.” Bello, who dismissed insinuations that APC will not give him the ticket to run for the second term, said “They (critics) know that l am the leader of the party in my state. I have built it and it is very strong.” “In the November Governorship election, we are not just talking of winning, we are looking at the margins. The margin is going to be such that whoever comes far second, will be discouraged to go to court.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
