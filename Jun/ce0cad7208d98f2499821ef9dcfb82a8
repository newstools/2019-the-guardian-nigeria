The staff and the players could not hold back their tears,” the statement added. As Cameroon have yet to play their first game at the tournament, they can still replace Tagueu. The holders begin the defence of their title against Guinea Bissau in Ismailia today. The risk of heart failure during the game is an emotive issue for Cameroon, whose midfielder Marc-Vivien Foe collapsed and died while playing for the Indomitable Lions at the 2003 Confederation Cup in France. Foe, only 28, collapsed on the field and lost consciousness during the semi-final against Colombia at the Stade de Gerland in Lyon. After attempts to resuscitate him on the pitch, medics spent 45 minutes at the stadium’s medical centre trying to restart his heart, and although he was still alive when he arrived there, he died shortly afterwards. He was later found to have suffered from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a heart-related disease. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
