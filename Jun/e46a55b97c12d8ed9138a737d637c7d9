To facilitate regional trade, Customs authorities in Nigeria and Benin have adopted single goods declaration, as both countries introduce modern tools for inter-border clearance of goods.
   
Under the new system, declarations made for imports transiting from either of the countries to the other would be electronically shared to deal with corrupt tendencies and increase security.
  
The Assistant Comptroller-General of Customs, Zone ‘A’, Benjamin Aber, who disclosed this during the stakeholders’ sensitisation programme between Nigeria Customs Service and Benin Customs at Seme border, said both agencies are committed to taking bold steps to coordinate border management operations, in order to enable stakeholders to have seamless operations and facilitate trade between Nigeria and Republic of Benin.  Director-General of Customs, Republic of Benin, Charles Saka, said there was need for customs to work on inter-connectivity which was recommended by the global organisation of Joint Border Post that was built by ECOWAS.
  
Saka said that the presidents of both countries met in Badagry 14 years ago to showcase their efforts in improving inter- border trade, which led to the connectivity platform intended to facilitate trade.
   
Representing National Agency for Food Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Dr. Nurudeen Audi, urged Customs of both countries to involve other government agencies at the borders in the connectivity project.
  
Also speaking, Mrs. Layo Okeowo, who represented the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) commended the Customs of the two countries for initiating the connectivity platform project.
  
“It is a beautiful idea and I hope the human factor will not hinder the success of the project,“ Okeowo said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
