The Senior Pastor of Praise Arena, Pastor Jummy Adetoyese-Olagunju, has called for inter-religious dialogue to promote religious tolerance among various faiths in the country to further cement the unity in the country, while he also charged the President Buhari-led administration to make the fight against corruption in the next four years, a developmental process that will include all strata of the national life.
 
Olagunju made this known at the Super Praise Carol organised by the church, which held at Le-Real Hotel, VGC, Lekki, Lagos. Speaking on the multi-ethnicity and current agitations for separate federations, he noted that the United States of America is a country with over 350 million people and they are living together in peace even when they have divergent views, opinion, background and interest. “In the midst of diversity, the interest of the country is paramount to everyone right from infanthood. This can happen here with the help of religious leaders preaching peace, unity and tolerance to their followers.” The pastor also lamented the dearth of good leadership in Nigeria noting that some people who offer themselves for leadership positions in the country are only spokespersons for the people who exploit our divisions to drive their own personal cause.
