Irina Shayk is moving on from Bradley Cooper with her chin up and legs strutting! One week after it was confirmed that the supermodel, 33, and actor, 44, had called it quits after four years of dating, Shayk stepped out at her first public outing in Florence, Italy. Walking in the CR Runway x LuisaViaRoma 90th Anniversary Show on Thursday, a leather-clad Shayk looked fierce as she strutted down the runway wearing a black, form-fitting, strapless Ermanno Scervino dress.

Prior to walking in the Italian fashion show, Shayk spent some time in Iceland and shared several photos from her trip on Instagram. The photos came just two days after news of her split from Cooper broke.   .. @falconeriofficial A post shared by  irinashayk (@irinashayk) on Jun 8, 2019 at 10:14am PDT  Read More: Bradley Cooper and Irina Shayk Call It Quits After 4 Years Of Dating
