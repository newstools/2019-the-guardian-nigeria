• Afenifere, Akande canvass community policing to check insecurity
• Olonisakin heads ECOWAS committee of defence chiefs President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned the attacks on the people of Kona in Taraba State, ordering security agencies to immediately halt the violence. In a statement yesterday by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, the president warned that attacks on innocent people in the name of revenge or whatever form would not be tolerated by his government. He said resorting to self-help was an invitation to anarchy, which makes everyone unsafe. Buhari noted that in a cycle of violence characterised by revenge and counter-revenge, there are no winners. The president reminded Nigerians that in a state of permanent hostilities, people undermine not only law and order, but also their own ability to conduct their everyday business in peace. Meanwhile, the president has re-appointed Mr. Ahmed Idris as Accountant-General of the Federation (AGF) for a final term of four years. The announcement was contained in a statement issued by the Head of Service of the Federation (HOSF), Mrs. Winifred Oyo-Ita in Abuja. Besides, Governor Babagana Zulum yesterday visited Aso Villa where he sought the president’s action on the raging Boko Haram insurgency in Borno State. He told reporters that he also sought intervention on means of livelihood of the people. Besides, the Pan-Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, has urged the people to be more vigilant and increase communal policing in order to stem the security challenge in the South West region. Rising from a meeting convened yesterday by its factional leader, Senator Ayo Fasanmi in Osogbo, Osun State, Afenifere stated that the situation on ground calls for collaboration. Also, former Interim National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Bisk Akanke, has advocated for community policing as a panacea to the nation’s security problems. He made the advocacy in a paper he presented yesterday in Oslo, Norway. Also yesterday, the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Abayomi Gabriel Olonisakin, assumed the headship of the ECOWAS Committee of Chiefs of Defence Staff at the ongoing 39th ordinary meeting of the sub-regional body in Abuja. He called for improved intelligence gathering, joint and combined operations in order to combat the security threats currently plaguing West Africa. Olonisakin said collective efforts and collaborations with other stakeholders and partners in the pursuit of collective security and economic development would ensure peace and stability in the region through the platform provided by ECOWAS.
