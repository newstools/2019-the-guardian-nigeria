 Buhari  In a statement by Basil Onwukwe, Public Relations Officer, the body said: “The integrity myth is over. The reign of politics of primordial ethnocentrism could no longer be sustained under false claim of democracy, while our rights are sequestered by the caliphate-controlled Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from Abuja or the cabal that determines which court order to accept. We cannot celebrate such democracy. “World Igbo Congress will not accept an autocratic regime as a constitutional democracy, when the government arm-twisted virtually everyone and everything that supports the doctrine of separation of powers. We cannot accept any government driven by executive illegality, no democracy where dissent voices are forced to surrender or silenced by intimidation.” Saying it would not continue to manage a system built on a fraudulent foundation, the body maintained that the 2019 general election was marred with different sets of rules and guidelines for different regions, to manipulate the results with the use of card readers and manual accreditation, to suppress vote against opponents of the ruling party. The Congress said the nation had no reason to celebrate democracy, as the current administration’s activities portrayed it as autocratic. “The only Christian Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Walter Onnoghen to head the Judiciary in the last 30 years was deposed to make way for election manipulation,” the statement said.
