He could play at the top, score three to four goals per game.” Balotelli, who scored eight goals in 15 games since joining Marseille from fellow Ligue 1 club Nice in January has not featured on the international stage since September. “He still does things that he shouldn’t do and got a four-match ban in Ligue 1,” continued Mancini. “He has twelve months to return to the group. It’s in his hands.” Torino striker Andrea Belotti has been rewarded for his club form in the closing months of the season, with eight of his 15 Italian league goals coming since the start of March. “Belotti did far better in the second half of the season, so he earned this call-up,” said Mancini. The Azzurri go into the games top of Group J — which also includes Finland, Armenia and Liechtenstein — after two wins from two. “The next two games are probably the most difficult in the group,” said the Mancini. “Greece have improved in the last year, Bosnia have first of all two players that we know well and can be decisive,” he added of Roma’s Edin Dzeko and Juventus’ Miralem Pjanic.
