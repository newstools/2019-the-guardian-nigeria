The new Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG) Murtala Mani, has warned fraudsters and bandits operating in any part of the country to quit or face the wrath of the unit. The new Criminal Investigations Department boss said the department has spread its dragnet across all states in the country in line with the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mohammed Abubakar Adamu’s concerted effort to reposition the Nigeria Police Force, the Force Criminal Investigation Department (FCID) Annexe at Alagbon Close, Lagos. Speaking with newsmen at his maiden press briefing at the weekend, the AIG in charge of the FCID Annex, Alagbon Close, Mani, warned fraudsters and other criminally minded people to turn a new leaf as the FCID Alagbon under his watch would strictly reinvigorate the corporate identity for which the various sections of the department were known for in yester-years. The sections, which are 11 in number include General Investigation, Interpol, Central Criminal Registry, Police Special Fraud Unit, Homicide and Forensic. Other sections are Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad, Special Enquiry Bureau, Anti-Human Trafficking, Legal and X-Squad.
