Nigeria Stock Exchange (NSE). Photo/rainbowfm The nation’s equity market closed trading on a volatile note last week, consolidating three consecutive sessions of losses after the two-day public holiday for Eid Mubarak. The consistent downturn during the sessions, which pulled the All-Share Index (ASI) by 2.05 per cent followed the dwindling investor confidence due to the face-off between the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and Oando Plc. Specifically, the index and market capitalisation depreciated by 2.05 per cent and 2.06 per cent to close the week at 30,432.13 points and N13.402 trillion respectively. Similarly, all other indices depreciated with the exception of the NSE Premium Index, NSE-AFR Bank Value Index and NSE MERI Growth Index which appreciated by 1.07 per cent, 0.02 per cent and 0.05 per cent respectively. However, analysts believed that the continued decline of market indices has created “buy” opportunities, rather than selling. Precisely, the Chief Research Officer of Investdata Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omodion, stressed the need for government to do the needful by urgently appointing economic managers to kick start disbursement of funds now that the 2019 budget has been passed into law. “We note that early implementation of the budget will trigger economic activity which would ultimately boost the stock market as well as ensure that the country do not slip into another recession,” he said.
