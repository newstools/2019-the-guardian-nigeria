The Super Eagles have only score two goals in their two games at the on-going African Cup of Nations in Egypt, but Coach Gernot Rohr is not worried. Rather, he is pleased with the better understanding exhibited by his wards in the two games they have played so far, adding also that winning is the most important thing in a game. Nigeria beat Burundi in its opening game and also defeated Guinea by the same margin in the second match to book its place in the second round. Now the Super Eagles will meet Madagascar in their last game, which win or draw will give the team leadership of the group. Some fans have criticised the Eagles’ low score rate, saying it might work against the team when they meet the best teams in the competition. But Rohr says, “I am not worried because we have been creating many chances to score. We scored a beautiful goal against Burundi. We scored from a corner, which I think is a good thing. “So, we are working hard to present a good team that will give us victory. That is all that maters.” The Eagles had one training session ahead of Sunday’s match at the Arab Academy of Science, Technology and Maritime Transport, Alexandria yesterday evening. It was open to journalists. They will also train today by the same time at the same venue with only the first 15 minutes open to journalists. Before then, they will hold a press conference at the Alexandria Stadium by 11.30 a.m. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
