Nigerian gospel singer, Yinka Ayefele has taken to social media to enlighten the public about fake reports of him welcoming triplets in the United States of America (USA) with his wife, Temitope Titilope. According to the fake news, the singer and his wife welcomed the children whose gender were not disclosed earlier today but according to his Instagram post, the story has no merit to it. Reacting to the false report, Ayefele was quick to distance himself from the rumour while also claiming that it is a prayer. The music star shared an image asking fans to disregard all rumours. He shared the image with the caption, “Fake News, Fake Pictures. 
That picture was taken 7 years ago during my younger brothers naming at music house in Ibadan. 
Thank you all for Wishing me well and I claim it in Jesus name.” It would be recalled that the Oyo state government under the former governor, Abiola Ajimobi on August 19, 2018 demolished the Music House owned by Ayefele. The structure, valued at N800m, housed Ayefele’s Fresh FM radio station and other businesses. The demolition was carried out with the government claiming infringement of some building laws but the remorseful government later ordered that it was rebuilt with workers given a December 2018 deadline to ensure the building was completed.
