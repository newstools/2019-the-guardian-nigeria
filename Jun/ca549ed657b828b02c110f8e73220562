Coach Gernot Rohr yesterday revealed he would make some changes in the Super Eagles’ line up against the Barea of Madagascar in today’s game at the Alexandria Stadium in Egypt.
 
Rohr expressed his plan to put the players under pressure for a healthy competition in every position, adding that he would repeat the same thing he did in the second game against Guinea, when he made five changes from the team that met Burundi.
 
“We will make some changes in tomorrow’s game against Madagascar. I want to put everybody under pressure. There is competition in each position now, even in the goalkeeper’s department, the central defence, and the striker’s position.
 
“In the last game, we had five changes and it is possible we have another one tomorrow (today),” he said, adding that the two players that were injured, were still recuperating and would be back in the next round of the competition.
   
“Shehu Abdullahi and Jamilu Collins are on their way to recovery. They are taking special training sessions with the physical training coach and the physiotherapist. We hope they will be available for the next round of the competition. “Tomorrow’s game will be too short for them, because I don’t want to take any risks,” he added. Rohr described the Malagasy players as very fit and fast, adding that they recover quickly. “I don’t believe that they are tired because the team won their last game. I know them very well, they are a good side.
 
“Their coach Nicholas Dupuis is a very good coach. They started like us on the same day and we will play them tomorrow (today). It will be an open match against a good team like Madagascar,” he said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
