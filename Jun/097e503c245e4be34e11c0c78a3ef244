The Initiative for Information Technology Capacity Building (i4itcb), has called for improved pedagogy among Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) tutors in the South Eastern part of Nigeria. The Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), said at a one-day Academia’s & Technology Seminar for STEM lecturers held in Enugu, in collaboration with the Nigeria Computer Society (NCS), and Oracle Academy, which demonstrated educational curriculum resources to aid the educators impart their students. Speaking at the seminar, themed: Teaching for Industry Relevant STEM Skills’, Prof. Hettie Abimbola Soriyan, Lecturer at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, Osun State, said STEM teachers need a change of mindset to be able to win-back students to the classrooms. She said, “They are working with a generation that does not show as much interest in classroom lectures as it was in times gone by, because their interest in technology, especially social media, has increased in leaps, almost as a disadvantage. So, lecturers need to leave our comfort zones to train ourselves to use that technology to reach out to the students. Engage the students; give them some things to think about, analyse and present their thoughts. “From the exercise we did here, the participants now have a better understanding of areas that need improvement on their part. If teachers transpose skills learnt from the exercise into system development analysis, it is clear, more work is required on the part of the Lecturers. I recommend that programs like this should be spread over two to three days; as there are still lots to discuss about how to win-back the students.” Soriyan, emphasised need to transform the same technology students are using to their advantages. “When you want to give assignment link it to social media and recent topics. They like watching videos like cartoons. Let’s test them based on those areas. We have to appreciate the fact that theirs is a generation that is tech-savvy only for use and consumption and are not interested in developing technology parse. So, teachers need to change the dynamics”, she added. Executive Secretary of the Nigeria Computer Society (NCS), Iyiola Ayoola, said that from the theme it is obvious that participants have been exposed to the need to teach computer science or IT courses in the relevant way; that is, to galvanize the economy into fourth industrial revolution. During her presentation, the Country Programs Manager, Sub-Saharan Africa, Oracle Academy, Sefunmi Fadahunsi, reiterated the global IT giant’s determination to impact next generation of professionals through free educational resources around STEM that teachers and schools can leverage on to deliver quality teaching and learning experience.
