A major contender of the All Progressives Congress (APC) gubernatorial ticket in Kogi State, Mohammed Audu, has tasked the national leadership of the party to adopt a fair and generally acceptable model in selecting a standard bearer for the November 16, 2019 election in the state. Audu spoke to The Guardian on telephone against the background of the disparate positions by the two factions of the party over direct and indirect primaries.He said the middle course to take in the ongoing disputation would be for APC headquarters to ignore the two factions and set up an impartial caretaker committee to oversee the governorship primary. Avoiding the dingdong over the issue of direct or indirect primary is a function of the national headquarters choosing the best model, as Kogi APC is divided between loyalists of the late Abubakar Audu and Governor Yahaya Bello, he explained. The eldest son of the late Audu, contended that since both tendencies all have strong representation across the state, “for Kogi APC not to åatdisintegrate, the national headquarters should come in and create a caretaker committee.” Audu noted that the headquarters had missed a golden opportunity to bring everybody together, regretting that a lot of water had gone under the bridge leading to “a very strong tussle between the two factions.” The APC chieftain advised party faithful in the state to canvass fairness, since indirect primary would amount to giving automatic ticket to Governor Bello. He urged the national leadership of the party to learn from recent experiences in some states to ensure that Kogi electorate, who have resolved to vote APC, are not subjected to a situation of helplessness over an unpopular candidate.
