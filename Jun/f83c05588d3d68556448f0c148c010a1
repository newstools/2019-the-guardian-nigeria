Chocolate City act Blaqbonez has recently released the official music video to his single ‘Mamiwota’ which features Oxlade off his Bad Boy Blaq album released last year. Blaqbonez spoke to The Guardian Life about the collaboration and Oxlade;
“I worked with Oxlade before anybody really fucked with Oxlade so it wasn’t like I was working with a fast rising artist, It was like I was working with a gem that nobody had discovered and now I’m happy everyone recognizes the talent and respects the guy because to me the guy is one of the most talented guys I’ve ever heard.” The rapper has been on a roll recently and has even made the bold assertion that he is the best rapper in Africa and he intends to show how much he means business on his upcoming project. “it’s Mr. Bombastic season so the music is gonna be completely different.” he says “It’s going to be like really bombastic and the groove is gonna be fucking crazy.” The video was shot and directed by TG Omori in Lagos, Nigeria.
