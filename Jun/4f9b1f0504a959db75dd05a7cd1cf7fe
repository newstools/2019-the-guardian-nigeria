Paradigm Initiative has asked the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to provide information on the Nigerian surveillance and interception regime. The pan-African Digital Rights and Digital Inclusion organisation is relying on the Freedom of Information (FoI) Act 2011 to request information on NCCâ€™s role in enabling law enforcement to carry out communication surveillance and interception of communication in the discharge of their duties. A copy of the request sighted by The Guardian indicate that it requested the commission to disclose measures it has put in place to ensure that government does not abuse communication surveillance and interception of communication to target political opponents and critics. It also asked NCC to disclose the regulatory framework under which communication surveillance and interception of communication are being carried out in the country.Programme Manager, Digital Rights, Anglophone Africa at Paradigm Initiative, Adeboye Adegoke, said the group has always engaged government on its communications surveillance and interception activities.
