Here are the allegations against the Emirate Council Awarded Contracts to 21 shell companies
According to the commission’s investigation, huge sums of money were transferred to some banks accounts which were claimed to be companies’ accounts. The commission said the companies appeared to be unregistered with the Corporate Affairs Commission or dormant that cannot appear in the public search of the companies register. Investigations also show that the unregistered companies are linked to some identified suspects in the emirate council. The investigation will later reveal the beneficial owners of those entities. N117 million to fuel  generators in four years The commission revealed that the Kano Emirate council expended N117 million fuelling generators from 2014 to 2017. It said the council expended N43 million in 2014, N39 million in 2015, N22 million in 2016 and N12 million in 2017. While the huge sum spent is no reason for the questioning, the commission is interested in the disparity in the amount involved. “The ratio at which the fuel was consumed from 43 to 22 Million called for suspicion and indicated acts of misappropriation and fraud,” the report signed by Muhuyi Magaji Rimingado said.
