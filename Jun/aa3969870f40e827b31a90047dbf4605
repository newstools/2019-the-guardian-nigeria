Justice Mohammed Garba, while giving the ruling, held that HDP and Chief Ambrose Owuru, it’s the presidential candidate in Feb. 23 general election remained consenting plaintiffs in the eyes of the law. NAN reports that Owuru and the HDP had jointly filed a petition before the tribunal to challenge the victory of President  Buhari and the All Progressives Congress at the poll. But a faction of the party led by Poland Tapre subsequently filed an application before the tribunal praying for the withdrawal of the party as a co-petitioner in the case on the grounds that the petition was filed in the name of the party without its consent.
