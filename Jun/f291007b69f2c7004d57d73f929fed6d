He commended the transparent and fair nature of the voting process, adjudging it as a plus for the democracy in the country. President Buhari described the emergence of the new leaders of the legislative branch of government as “a new dawn, different from duplicity and perfidy of the immediate past.” He charged the winners to use their exalted positions for the higher interest of the country, her people, and for the growth of democracy. “The executive does not desire a rubber stamp legislature.
