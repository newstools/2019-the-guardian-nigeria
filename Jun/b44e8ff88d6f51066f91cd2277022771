To curtail the high suicide rate among students in Nigeria, the Strap & Safe Child Foundation has called for the setting up of parenting institutes across the country to teach people how to become better parents and in turn raise proper children. The foundation among other recommendations noted that the high rate of suicide and depression among children can be linked to peer pressure, recent technological advancement, high expectations and a lack of understanding from parents. It, therefore, called on government to provide necessary policies that will ensure that schools provide capable guidance counselors who understand confidentiality and are willing to work with the students and parents at all times. The call was contained in a communiqué issued at the end of the foundation’s one-day symposium and signed by the founder/CEO, Mrs. Bolanle Edwards. The symposium themed ‘Emotional Safety: The New Frontier’ was attended by all stakeholders involved with children’s wellbeing. According to her, although the foundation had a mandate to promote safe driving and children transiting habits through the use of seatbelts and other forms of restraints as appropriate to reduce the risk of death in case of an accident of children between ages 0 and 12, the foundation decided to go a step further towards addressing the issue of emotional safety because of the increasing rise of suicide among children and teenagers.
