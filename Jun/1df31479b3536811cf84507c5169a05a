The loss meant the Nigerian senior women football team crashed out of the ongoing 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup in France. Germany have thus qualified for their eighth consecutive quarter-final appearance at the FIFA Women’s World Cup. Abdullahi, while reacting to the Falcons’ loss, said the Nigerian team had needed a miracle to defeat Germany in the match. “You cannot compare Nigeria with Germany because Germany is a strong  team. So, I did not believe or hope that Nigeria will defeat Germany. “Our girls did not play as a team but they played an individual game. They played according to their level. “They had struggled to win the  African Women Cup of  Nations (AWCON) and  West African Football Union (WAFU) Cup. That was their level. Germany are on another level,” he said. The coach advised that the NFF needs to prepare some Falconets players to strengthen the Falcons  ahead of the next World Cup finals. “Young  players like Rasheedat Ajibade, Chidinma Okeke and some others need to be focused upon to strengthen the next Falcons team at the next World Cup,” he said.
