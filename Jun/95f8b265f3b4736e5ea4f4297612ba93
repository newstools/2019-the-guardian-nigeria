A victory over Guinea Bissau will put them close to the second round before their final group game against Cameroon. Dussuyer said, “Technically, I think we were not too good against Ghana, but as I said before we came here to learn and acquire experience. “The game against Guinea Bissau is going to be decisive for us if we must progress to the next round. “If we can claim three points that would be a total of four points, which is close to what we need to move on. “For now, we will take some rest and then commence preparation for the game against Guinea Bissau which will be very difficult.” This is Benin’s first appearance in the competition since 2010, and the prospects look brighter than their previous four appearances. Qualification for the second round will show that the project started by Dussuyer in his second stint on the job is on the right track.
