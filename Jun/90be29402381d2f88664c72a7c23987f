Trindade maintains the recording, of which a few seconds have been leaked on social media, includes conclusive evidence. It formed a part of the testimony she presented to Brazilian police on Friday. The images were filmed on a tablet device which has been stolen, according to Trindade, but the owners of the building where she lives have denied claims of a forced break-in. According to G1, she also claims to possess other proof held in a safe. Trindade’s original lawyers walked away from her case because she had initially filed a complaint of physical abuse and not rape. Her testimony came a day after Neymar went to a Rio de Janeiro police station, sitting in a wheelchair after injuring his ankle in Wednesday’s friendly against Qatar which ruled him out of this year’s Copa America.
