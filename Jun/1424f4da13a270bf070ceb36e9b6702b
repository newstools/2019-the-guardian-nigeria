And because of this we are expecting a very high level of participation and competition during the tournament. “I am calling on all interested stakeholders and journalists to come out in droves to watch matches during the tournament. “My appeal also goes to the athletes to put up top performance at the championships because that could change their lives, especially when it will give them the opportunity to make it to the Olympic team if they perform well. “Becoming an Olympian is probably one of the main things for an athlete to achieve. And I am wishing everybody the best of luck,” he stated.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
