Lamphrai Srinuan is concerned about her rare condition which has become a source of pain for her. When 46-year-old Thailand woman first noticed that her breasts were swelling about three years ago, she thought that it was just.. you know… nothing. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-952909 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Breasts.-Photo-SunUK.png" alt="" width="1280" height="644" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Breasts.-Photo-SunUK.png 624w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Breasts.-Photo-SunUK-487x245.png 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Breasts.-Photo-SunUK-320x161.png 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Breasts.-Photo-SunUK-600x302.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> But two years and a half into this, her breasts began to swell like a pumped balloon and caused shoulder, back, shoulder pain as well as a joint infection. Srinuan who does not have any child and her husband, Bunleang decided to go to the Buddhachinaraj hospital in Phitsanulok, the SunUK reports. It was here they found that she has Gigantomastia- a rare condition that causes excessive growth of the female breasts and has no known cause. She explained to the SunUk that she has found difficulties with sleeping. “It’s very difficult for me to even sit or lay down to sleep at night.

I only have one large shirt that I wear when I go to the hospital.” To cover her breasts and avoid attention, she has to tie a heavy cloth as a means of support. In addition to this, she has stopped working and has to walk with the aid of crutches. Although it is non-cancerous, some of its effects include breast pain, posture problems, infections, and back pain. Gigantomastia can be treated by going for a breast reduction surgery or a mastectomy.
