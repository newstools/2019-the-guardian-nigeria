Bertola The Chairman, Bayelsa State Independent Electoral Commission (BYSIEC), Dr. Perekeme Bertola, has resigned over alleged threat to his life by some unnamed persons. The resignation, coming 10 weeks to the August 10 date for the state local government election, triggered controversy within the opposition, accusing the ruling party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of a cover up. A source in the commission, however, hinted that the chairmanâ€™s resignation might be connected to the fact that Bertola bowed to pressure from opposition parties to have the elections shifted by two weeks. According to the source, the shift in the date allegedly angered some power brokers in the state, who in turn wanted him out of office by any means.
