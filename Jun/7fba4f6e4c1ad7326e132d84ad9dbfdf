Popular animated series “The Boondocks” is making a return to the screens after a 5 year break. In a recent interview on Joe Rogan’s podcast John Witherspoon who voiced the character of Robert Freeman throughout the show’s four-season run, says the series would be back for season 5. “I’m on the cartoon—what is it? The Boondocks? I didn’t change my voice for The Boondocks,” Witherspoon said when explaining how he stays true to himself with every role. “And they coming back: The Boondocks is coming back … It’s one of the best cartoons I’ve ever been on.” Adult Swim is yet to officially announce The Boondocks’ revival, though there has also been a lot of speculation about its return in recent years. The series was based on a comic strip by Aaron McGruder and premiered in late 2005. Watch John Witherspoon’s full interview via YouTube below;
