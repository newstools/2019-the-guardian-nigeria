  Here are some of the top moments and bon-mots from the two-day meeting hosted by Japan in the city of Osaka: - Trade truce -
It was the summit within a summit: the long-awaited meeting between US President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping to thrash out a truce in the trade war between the world's top two economies. And when the meeting was over, Trump delivered the news everyone had been waiting for: "We are right back on track," the US president said after talks he described as "excellent." There were precious few details on what the two leaders had agreed, beyond a committment to resume trade negotiations and hold off on tariffs, offering the world economy some breathing space for now. - Climate change heat -
At a summit expected to be dominated by trade, climate change proved an unexpected hot potato, with France's Emmanuel Macron saying the issue was a "red line" before talks even began.

"We avoided going backwards... but we must go much further," Macron said after the summit. - North Korea, but no Iran -
With tensions spiralling in the Gulf, Iran was expected to be a key focus at the summit and bilateral meetings, but it was barely mentioned, with Trump instead stealing the show in a surprise tweet... on North Korea. "If Chairman Kim of North Korea sees this, I would meet him at the Border/DMZ just to shake his hand and say Hello(?)!" Trump tweeted, inviting Kim Jong Un to meet for a historic handshake at the demilitarised zone that divides the Korean peninsula. The tweet came before Trump headed to South Korea, and he insisted he would have "no problem" stepping into the North with Kim if invited.

"Don't meddle in the election, president, don't meddle," he said, wagging his finger jokingly at the Kremlin strongman. Trump also showered praise on Saudi Crown Prince Salman bin Mohammed, despite accusations of his involvement in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. And he posed with off his signature thumbs up for a photo with Brazil's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, sometimes dubbed the 'Trump of the Tropics.'

But Juncker made a candid admission even as negotiations were ongoing, saying jetlag had prompted him to break a longstanding tradition of not reading the communique. "I'm not the only one in this room who does not read the communique. Nobody in fact reads the communique."  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
