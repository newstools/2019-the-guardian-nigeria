Commander of the 9th Brigade, Nigeria Army Cantonment, Ikeja, Brigadier General Nasir Jega has implored Lagos residents to ensure their environment is clean by engaging in sanitation exercise. He said this is important, as a clean environment will foster good health for everybody. Speaking yesterday, during a sanitation exercise by the Army, Jega said the exercise was part of activities to mark the annual Nigerian Army Day Celebration. He said the sanitation exercise was carried out in two other locations in Lagos; Ikoyi and Ojo.
 
“It is part of the task from the Army Chief of Staff, that on this day we should go round and carry out this exercise so as to promote civil-military relations with communities around us.” He said Ipodo was picked for the exercise, because it is closer to their cantonment.
 
The sanitation exercise came on a day many residents of Lagos were not sure whether the monthly environmental sanitation had been formally reintroduced. For weeks now, there had been rumours that the monthly sanitation exercise will be brought back, though Lagos State government had debunked it.
 
The soldiers, in branded white vests and military camouflage had shovels, rakes, and brooms with wheelbarrows to cart away refuse to standby compactors around Ipodo, Ikeja.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
