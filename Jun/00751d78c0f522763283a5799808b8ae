The Captain of the Ibadan Golf Club (IGC), Col. Ade Sumonun has highlighted many derivable benefits associated with the game of golf, describing the game as a ‘life on its own’. The retired military officer, who assumed the position of Captain at IGC a few months ago, recommend the game for professionals and upwardly mobile businessmen that hardly have time to recreate. He says it is a good means of relaxation with great health advantages attached. “Apart from the many health benefits associated with the game of golf, you can also settle scores of issues on the golf course while playing. You meet people from many walks of life and you network businesswise while playing. “Golf will take you off many things that are less important, for instance for me, it is my work, my office and the game of golf. It is occupying and addictive and it makes you want to go back to the course every time and the mistake you made today, you want to correct it the next day… it is life, that is full of ups and downs,” Sunmonu noted. , however, reiterated his vow to give IGC a new look having served in different capacity in the club. “I am quite in a familiar terrain. I have served in different capacities at this club. I have served as an assistant captain and in many committees in the club. “I have my dreams and visions, I intend to give the course more attention by making it greener. I want to change the total outlook that immediately you enter the club you sense that you are actually in a golf club,” he said. Sunmonu adds that he intends to improve the activities at the bar and also “work on the range we have now where we practice, to be more befitting. Above all, I want to maintain the rich tradition of the game by taking the club to the next level.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
