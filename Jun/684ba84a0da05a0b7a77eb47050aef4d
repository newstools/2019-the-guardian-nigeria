Happy that the Super Eagles advanced to the last 16 of the competition through his 73rd minute goal, Omeruo assured Nigerians that the team will continue to fight to delight them, adding that the ultimate ambition is to win the trophy. Omeruo, who was named Man of the Match by CAF, said the players were focused on the pitch despite the pay dispute they had with the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) a day before the game.Speaking after the game, Omeruo said, “We knew no matter what is going on off the pitch, our job is to play. “Nigerians are hoping that we win every game, so we knew we had to forget everything and focus on today’s game and be the first to qualify from our group, I am happy we could achieve that.” Omeruo is part of a tight-knit defence that has kept a clean sheet for the second game running and he attributes it to the players’ focus on the proceedings. “For me it is important to say focused, we have a wonderful squad. I have been out for a while and they have been playing and been doing well.“It doesn’t matter who plays, we have a strong defence and it showed today. I just want to give my best.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
