A sell-out crowd of 45,261 filled the Parc des Princes in Paris to watch the start of what is billed as the biggest women’s World Cup yet. The France v China women’s match broadcast last Friday only attracted a fraction of that figure, 1.2 million. All of France’s games will be broadcast free in France as will the final in Lyon July 7.
