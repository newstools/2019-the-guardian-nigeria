There’s no better defence than one coming from family. Kim Kardashian has come out to defend her sister, Kylie Jenner, following the series of backlash she received after sharing a face-wash tutorial to promote her new Kylie Skin Foaming Face Wash. The reality TV star took a rather playful approach in addressing the incident which happened earlier in the week whereby fans slammed Jenner for ‘not washing her properly’. morning and night  pic.twitter.com/y5jibIxnfM — Kylie Skin (@kylieskin) May 29, 2019  In a series of light-hearted videos posted on the Kylie Cosmetics’ Instagram Stories on Friday, Kardashian West shared that if she had been in her sister’s shoes, she would have also posted an equally short clip. “I’m gonna teach you guys how to do a tutorial on how to wash your face, and bitches, I only have 10 seconds. What else do you want me to do in 10 seconds?” she shared. “I would have done the same exact thing.” “Should I pick every single product, because we know it’s sold out so, guys, what is the big deal here with a 10-second video?

This isn’t the first time Jenner has gotten backlash over her Kylie Skin line. Before the star’s collection even launched, fans called her out for using crushed walnut as a physical exfoliant in her Walnut Face Scrub, which many fans claim is too abrasive on the skin and can cause more harm than good. Regardless of such backlash, her products still sold out within the twinkle of an eye. Read More: Fans Slam Kylie Jenner For ‘Not Washing Her Face Properly’ In Skin Care Video
