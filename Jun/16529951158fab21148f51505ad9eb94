A Non-GOVERNMENTAL organisation, Centre for Peace and Environmental Justice (CEPEJ), has called on the Lagos State government to come to the aid of people living in Akodo community as their environment is in a pitiable condition, which is harmful to the health of residents. The group made the call during a sensitisation walk held in Akodo, Ibeju-Lekki local government area as part of initiatives to commemorate the World Environment Day, themed ‘Air Pollution’ yesterday. CEPEJ lamented that residents still dispose household waste through burning and the perishables left to decay openly, which pollutes the air and inconveniences residents. It urged government to urgently make waste disposal services available in the area. Speaking at the event, a representative of CEPEJ, Mrs. Victoria Ajayi, advised the community to be health conscious, stressing that ‘health is wealth’. She added that a poorly managed environment is detrimental to the living conditions of inhabitants. “We can help ourselves by separating the edibles or perishables from non-perishables and later bury the perishables. Through this means, waste would be reduced and the smell from the decaying edibles won’t pollute the air. Everyone needs to purchase a nose-covering mask to effectively protect themselves from polluted air when necessary”, she stated. The Baale of the community, Chief Adebayo Ogunlaja, explained that residents had no other choice but to dispose their wastes through burning as no one comes to pack the waste at regular intervals like it is done in other communities. He appealed for quick intervention of the state government.Reacting, a representative from the Lagos ministry of the environment, Mrs. Bolanle Odubelu, said to her knowledge, complaints regarding the community haven’t been received at the ministry.
