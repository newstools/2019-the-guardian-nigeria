The statement urged Chinese tourists to “fully assess the risk” and “improve their awareness of safety and security”. In a separate warning, China’s foreign ministry said US law enforcement agencies have “repeatedly” used methods such as immigration and on-site interviews to “harass” Chinese citizens in the US. It urged Chinese nationals and Chinese-funded institutions in the US to be cautious and “increase awareness and strengthen preventive measures.” The warnings come a day after the education ministry said students and academics were facing US visa problems and urged them to assess the “risk” of travelling to the United States.
