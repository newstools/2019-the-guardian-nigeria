Speaking ahead of the qualifiers, head coach of Nigeria Senior women’s volleyball team, Usman Abdallah assured that the nation would secure the ticket for the 2019 All Africa Games holding in Morocco later this year. He revealed that the team had been responding positively to training ahead of the qualifiers. Abdallah said he was not under pressure to deliver the AAG ticket for Nigeria. “We have been in camp for almost ten days now, and the girls are responding to training. I have also noticed a lot of improvement as far as the team is concerned. Thirty players were invited to camp and trimmed down to 18. It is encouraging. “We have been given a job to make sure we get the female team qualify for the All Africa Games. I do not think we are under pressure because the male team qualified. I believe that the players and coaches want the country to qualify also,” Abdullah said. He further stated that the federation had created an enabling environment for Nigeria to qualify, adding that the president was always in their training to watch the girls train and encourage them. “I think it is also a motivation to have the president watch the girls training all the time. Right now, we do not have any professional player in camp but what we are planning is to invite some of them after we qualify for the all Africa Games. I will try to invite those who are ready to help us. We will be inviting them because they are exposed. Currently, we have new and old crop of players in the team.The team will blend well ahead of the qualifiers,” Abdallah said.
