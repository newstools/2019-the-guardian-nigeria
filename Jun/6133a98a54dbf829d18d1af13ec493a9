Federal High Court, Lagos, has awarded a cost of N100,000 in favour of Department of State Services (DSS) and the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) against Senator Buruji Kashamu. According to yesterdayâ€™s ruling, Kashamu will pay N50,000 each to the two agencies for unduly delaying hearing of the application he filed to stop his extradition to the United States of America (U.S.A.) to face alleged drug-related charges. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) senator, who represented Ogun East at the 8th National Assembly, had in his suit marked FHC/L/CS/930/2018 joined the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Director General of DSS, NDLEA and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) as respondents. He is urging the court to restrain the respondents and their agents from arresting or detaining him, in any manner whatsoever, or interfering with his right to personal liberty and freedom of movement. Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke had taken arguments in the suit from the parties and reserved his judgement till April 29, 2019. But due to the Easter vacation, judgement could not be delivered in the suit on that date. The matter was consequently adjourned till May 10. It was further adjourned till June 6 for hearing. At the resumed hearing yesterday, counsel to the DSS and NDLEA respectively informed the court of the absence of the applicant and his counsel, which they said had occurred up to four occasions. DSS counsel urged the court to award a cost of N100,000 in its favour against the plaintiff. In the same vein, counsel to NDLEA also asked for a cost of N200,000 against Kashamu. In a short ruling, Justice Aneke awarded a cost of N50,000 each to DSS and NDLEA. The court adjourned the case till October 31 for hearing.
