Femi Adeoti, Managing Director, Africa Operations, Inlaks, expatiated on the event noting that “Most tech-startups do not have the experience to reach the customers that would buy into their solutions. “It is therefore our goal to hand-hold these startups and take them to greater heights while interfacing with some of our global clients and partners, and thereby take advantage of the opportunities that are possible.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
