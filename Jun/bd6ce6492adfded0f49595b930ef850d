Why spend so much money on your favourite perfume but less than an hour later, the scent is gone? No, it doesn’t mean your perfume is cheap, it just means you may be applying it wrong. Knowing the tricks below to employ could help keep the scent for longer. The best time to apply perfume is when you are fresh out of the shower and your skin is dry. Perfumes won’t hold on a perspiring body. Perfumes last longer on your clothes than they do when you apply to your body. For maximum impact all day, add a little of your scent to your clothes but keep in mind that depending on how strong the perfume is, it may be difficult to wash off. When adding a spray, stick to pulse points like your wrists, neck, and behind your knees. They radiate a little more heat, and they are a nice spot to bounce around the smell a bit. If you must apply your perfume to your skin then you should apply to moisturised skin. To avoid combining smells, use an unscented lotion or moisturiser before applying your perfume so that your scent is the only one that gets attention. Get a whiff with every hair flip by lightly spritzing your hairbrush with perfume before brushing your hair in the morning. Don’t apply the spray directly to your hair if the perfume is alcohol-based as you run the risk of drying your hair out. The hair holds a scent better than the skin does. Spritz your perfume onto the ends of your tresses because it is a waft nicer on the ends as the hair moves a little there. Different scents have different lifespans so if you want a longer lasting scent, choose scents that have base notes like vanilla, musk, and wood. Citruses tend to fade the fastest because their molecules are light. You can switch things up by combining two fragrances like a light base scent with a strong one to extend the life of your scent.
