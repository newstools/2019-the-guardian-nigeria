• Islamic Group Denounces Clamp Down On Members
The Kaduna Police Command has said 14 members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), otherwise known as Shiites, were arrested, following the procession on Friday. Besides, the Shiites claimed the procession was in commemoration of the Quds Day marked all over the world, saying the police attacked their members on a holy mission with guns and teargas. The Kaduna Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Yakubu Sabo, in a statement, admitted that 14 of them were arrested but denied knowledge of any killing of Shiite members, or injury sustained by them as claimed by some leaders of the movement, although IMN officials claimed that the figures were more. The IMN Spokesman, Mallam Ibrahim Musa, said:  “many people were  injured and arrested as the police fired on peaceful  procession, globally commemorated  in solidarity with oppressed people of Palestine.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
