 Governor Ihedioha Emeka of Imo. Photo/twitter/EmekaIhedioha  Ihedioha stated this yesterday shortly after his official visit to the Government House, Owerri, where he inspected government facilities including the offices, conference halls and residential buildings, among others. The Imo governor said that despite the deplorable state of facilitates he inherited from the immediate past governor, Rochas Okorocha, he would not give excuses for not performing as governor. He also accused Okorocha of being unwilling to handover to him officially and assured that he would govern the state with the fear of God. He said: “It is certain that we have difficulty operating from here (Government House) now. We will go round to see if there are other facilities that we can take off from. It is obvious we are facing a very trying and difficult time. “Day before yesterday when I spoke to Imo people, I assured that we would start work immediately and that we would give no excuse for not performing. So, we shall work to deliver dividends of democracy to Imo people irrespective of the state of facilitates that I am inheriting. “But it is important that we state that the government that ended its administration two days ago was not prepared to handover and was not ready to receive us. “I want to thank Imo people for electing us and for trooping out en mass to herald our regime. I want to assure you that we shall serve the state with the fear of God.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
