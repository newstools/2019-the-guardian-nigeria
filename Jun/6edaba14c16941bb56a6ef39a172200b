Burundi’s striker, Finston Abdoul Razak says he is at his first Total Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) to advertise his skills to football scouts.
 
The JS Kabile of Algeria striker was a thorn in the flesh of the Super Eagles’ defence line made up of Abdulahi Shehu, Williams Troost-Ekong, Kenneth Omeruo and Ola Aina on Saturday. With his fast paced dribbling runs, the Eagles had to be at their best to keep him in check. Yet, he almost scored on two occasions.
 
Speaking to The Guardian at the end of the match, Razak described the Eagles as an experienced side, and the strongest country in Group B of the AFCON. He said the inability of his team to score from the numerous chances they created gave Nigeria the slim victory.
 
“The game was a tough one on both sides. We were expecting to either win or at least play a draw. But you know Nigeria is not an easy team to beat, but they managed to score a goal in the 75th minute.
 
“What I can say about Nigeria is that Super Eagles are a good side and also luck was on their side because we created some opportunities but we couldn’t score. 
 
“This is my first Africa Cup of Nations and my performance today (Saturday) is not a big deal. I have been playing like that for both my club in Algeria and my country during the AFCON qualifiers,” he said.
 
The Burundian striker said he wants to use the AFCON to market himself, adding: “Playing the way I did against Nigeria is my way of marketing myself. As a professional I cannot be scared of any big country, not even Nigeria.“Hopefully, in our next game against Madagascar, we will work harder and make sure we win the match. “We may have to hammer Madagascar to stand a chance of qualifying for the next stage of the competition.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
