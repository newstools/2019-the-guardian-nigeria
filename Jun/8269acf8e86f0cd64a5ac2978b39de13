   According to the media officer of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF), Emeka Danner, 600 officials and 16 wrestling clubs will feature in the championship, which will be used to select the country’s representatives at the African Games and the World Wrestling Championships in Morocco and Kazakhstan respectively later this year.
 
He noted that the championship would also help discover more talents in the sport, adding that all logistics for the success of the one-week event had been put in place. “Any wrestler that wins a gold medal in both the male and females classes at the event will get express ticket to the African Games and the World Wrestling Championships. “The wrestling body is keen to see that Nigeria gets the best representatives for the various championships, which is why the competition is important to NWF. “Wrestlers and officials arrived yesterday and competition will start on Monday and end this weekend. We thank Bayelsa State for their support in ensuring that wrestling develops in Nigeria,” he said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
