There are many reasons why people decide to fast. It could be based on religious, health or aesthetics grounds but it does not really matter why you decide to go into intermittent fasting, it is however important you know the right things to do while fasting. Here are some tips to help you have a healthier fasting experience. When you do eat during a fast, make sure to include fluid-rich foods. Your body loses many fluids when you are fasting than on a normal day so to help you keep hydrated until you eat, fluid-rich foods should be top in your diet. Eat things like soups and fruits or a homemade oral rehydration solution of sugar, water, salt and boiled water to avoid headaches, dizziness, extreme fatigue or even fainting. Foods high in fibre content keep you fuller for longer and aid in digestion, which is a thing you want if you donâ€™t want to be constipated. Processed foods are not good for you during a fast, as they will leave you feeling bloated, lethargic, moody, and craving even more processed food. There is always the temptation to consume as much food as you can when braking a long fast but you need to understand that your gut is less active during a fast and at the time of breaking the fast, it might lack the proper digestive enzymes necessary to break down food. Take thing slow by eating things like soups or fruits as failure to do so can lead to inflammation and gastrointestinal stress.
