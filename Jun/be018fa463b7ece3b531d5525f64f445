A wildfire has consumed a Toyota Car parked near the Senate building, University of Lagos, Akoka. The fire which some students tagged as ‘mysterious’ started at about 11.50am on Saturday. The university’s firefighters could not curtail the inferno, hence a call was made to the Lagos State Fire Service station who arrived on time to save the situation from escalating. Vice Chancellor of the university who came in disguise to see the level of damage, lauded the fire service for their good work. Apart from the damaged car, no other property was affected by the fire.
