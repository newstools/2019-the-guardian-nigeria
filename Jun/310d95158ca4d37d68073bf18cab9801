 Atiku Abubakar. Pius Utomi EKPEI / AFP  After 18 days of waiting anxiously for Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa to name her replacement and fix a date for hearing in a time-bound presidential election petition, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar can now heave a sigh of relief.
  
This followed news that the tribunal has issued and served notice on all parties concerned for the commencement of hearing tomorrow in a proceeding that has 180 days life-span, starting from the date it was filed.The petitioners had filed the action on March 18, 2019, challenging  President Muhammadu Buhari’s victory in the February 23 poll, and by law, the hearing must be concluded by September, 2019.
  
Justice Bulkachuwa withdrew as a member and head of the five-man panel on May 22, following the allegation of the likelihood of bias levelled against her by the PDP and Atiku. The petitioners had alleged in their earlier application filed on May 16, 2019 that with the judge remaining as a member and head of the five-man tribunal, their petition would not be handled impartially.
