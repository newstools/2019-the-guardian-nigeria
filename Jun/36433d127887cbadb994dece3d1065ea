The forward has also played for Cologne and Werder Bremen in Germany and has 51 goals to his name from 171 Bundsliga appearances. “Anthony Ujah is a striker who has proven his class at several clubs in the Bundesliga and scored many goals,” said Oliver Ruhnert, Union’s director for professional football. “I’m absolutely sure that he will be extremely valuable for us with his experience.” Union secured a historic first promotion to the Bundesliga by defeating VfB Stuttgart in the play-off at the end of last month. Since then they have turned Suleiman Abdullahi’s loan move from Eintracht Braunschweig into a permanent switch and added five other players to their squad.
