The Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) has called on interested individuals and corporate bodies to apply for slots in the Zenith Bank sponsored Women’s Basketball League, ahead of the 2019 league session, which dunks off on July 1. The NBBF said after its board meeting in Lagos on Monday that in line with the mission statement of the federation, interested teams are encouraged to register their sides for the women’s basketball league. NBBF President, Musa Kida said the federation intended to accommodate more teams in this year’s league season, noting that applications and interest letters sent to the secretariat would be handled without sentiments. “I am quite happy with what I see in terms of response and I just want everybody to be rest assured that anybody who expresses interest will surely be considered and given a chance to participate. The smallest women’s team that can express interest in participating in the league will be given the chance,” he assured. He added that if there were over-subscription because of the continued growth of basketball in Nigeria, the NBBF would accommodate all genuine clubs.
