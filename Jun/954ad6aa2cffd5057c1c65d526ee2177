In a speech in Florida, Mnuchin called out “Iran’s willful failure to address its systemic money laundering and terrorist financing deficiencies.” He said an international task force will set a new deadline for the country to comply or face additional sanctions. The 38-nation Financial Action Task Force (FATF) had suspended measures against Iran but in February warned that it would be subject to increased scrutiny if it failed to implement promised reforms by this month to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. Mnuchin also said the FATF would call for suspended sanctions to be reimposed “if Iran does not make further progress,” and would require “increased supervisory examination for branches and subsidiaries of financial institutions based in Iran. A Trump administration official told AFP in an email the task force would on Friday afternoon announce the new oversight requirements and deadline as well as the “additional counter-measures” Iran could face if it fails to comply by the deadline.
