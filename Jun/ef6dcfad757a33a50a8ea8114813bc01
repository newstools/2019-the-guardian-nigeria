Shehu of Borno, Alhaji Abubakar El-Kanemi, has begged Governor Babagana Umara to return internally-displaced persons (IDPs) in Maiduguri camps to their communities. According to him, most of the displaced persons in camps were living in Abadam, Marte and Guzamala councils before Boko Haram attacked them in 2014.During a Sallah visit to the governor at Government House, Maiduguri, the monarch noted that many people had been displaced from their communities and forced to live in IDP camps for over five years. His words: “Borno has never been defeated, but the Boko Haram insurgency has posed a great challenge to our existence, as a state.“I’m optimistic that with the coming of Prof. Umara as governor, very soon the IDPs will return to their ancestral homes and communities.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
