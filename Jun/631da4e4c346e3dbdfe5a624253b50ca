 Burna Boy | Photo – Zikoko  In what may be the most personal song from him so far, Anybody addresses respect, growth, reputation, and, more importantly, recognising who you are and taking charge. The music comes from a place deep within the artiste, chronicling his journey to where he is today, while addressing paying his dues and rightly so. OluwaBurna, as he fondly calls himself, is saying the energy you give is the energy you get and he has switched it up. In true Burna Boy fashion, he maintains his easy conversational approach in this single but switched up on its groove. Anyone who is looking for great music, which makes for easy listening, will automatically be a fan of Anybody. The visuals for Anybody are a bit different from Burna Boy’s previous offerings. Here, he is front and centre in almost every scene, establishing himself as the star of the show, something else about Anybody that will resonate with Burna Boy’s true fans, who appreciate his style and craft, as an artiste. True to his craft, he sends a subtle message about freedom of expression with his lyrics and the visuals for the single, where models and dancers are dressed in rather bold, “alternative” outfits, dancing freely, clearly happy, almost daring anyone to challenge them. From lyrics to sound production, to stunning visuals, Burna Boy once again brings his A Game with the new song, consolidating his place as one of Africa’s great artistes, and establishing himself as an international musical force to be reckoned with. Anybody continues a successful year for Burna Boy, arriving after performances at both weekends of Coachella with more dates from his African Giant tour still to come. The song is also the latest taste from a new body of work following Dangote, On The Low, and Killin Dem with Zlatan and follows his explosive joint EP with production duo DJDS, Steel & Copper.
