Former Senate Majority Leader, Mohammed Ali Ndume, has dismissed as unrealistic, claims by his opponent in the race for Senate Presidency, Ahmed Lawan, of having secured the endorsement of over 60 Senators-elect. Reacting to report of Lawan’s endorsement, yesterday, Ndume noted that it was one thing to get endorsement and another to secure actual votes. Ndume, who spoke to journalists immediately after Lawan announced his endorsement, said: “I’ve said before that I am not looking for endorsement, but looking for votes on election day. You would recall that in 2015, the story of endorsement was also canvassed. He had the endorsement but what happened on the floor of the Senate was different…”He said he believed his colleagues would vote according to their conscience, and elect a suitable candidate.
