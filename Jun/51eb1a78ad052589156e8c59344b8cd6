After weeks of working on the project, the management of Atunda Entertainment yesterday released official single renowned Nigeria sensational female talking drummer, Ofurum Chiedu, popularly known as Ara Thunder. Titled Bojuboju, the track comes with a video that shows her mastery of the talking drum. With this new release produced by Atunda Entertainment and Succi, Ara Thunder, who is well-known at home with live performances as she has gone on tour with Atunda Entertainment across the country and other parts of the world, is here to stay and will stop at nothing to get to stardom, which beckons. It would be recalled that when the French President, Emmanuel Macron, visited The New Africa Shrine in Lagos, Ara Thunder was one of the artistes selected to entertain him. “Performing for President Macron is a big boost for my career as I have been receiving accolades and overtures from many people and organisations. I’m grateful to the Lagos State Government, Trace TV for the opportunity and privilege to have been selected as one of the artistes for that night. I am also grateful to Atunda Entertainment for giving me the opportunity to be part of the family,” she said. In her recent chat with BBC Africa, the female talking drummer hammered on preserving the rich African culture. “One thing I don’t really like about what we do, we don’t promote our own culture and that is very bad. And that is why I actually picked up the talking drum and owning it and saying to the people in Africa, ‘we have the uniqueness, we have the richness,’ so, we should promote our culture.” Meanwhile, Atunda Entertainment company has reiterated its commitment to the development and promotion of budding artistes of African extraction in line with its creed, which it said is based on building the continent of Africa by projecting to the world, its artistic talents, human resources, tourism and economic potential. Speaking on the focus of the outfit, which over the years has nurtured and promoted to the limelight a number of musical artistes in Nigeria and across the continent, the management disclosed that the organisation is neither a record label nor artiste management outfit as some people in the industry have erroneously projected and sold to the unsuspecting public. However, Atunda Entertainment is part of the activation of Motherland Beckons, a developmental organisation founded by the President of La Campagne Tropicana Beach Resort, Otunba Wanle Akinboboye. The main focus is developing and promoting different aspects of the continent through its ‘Continent Building’ project, which is devoted to attracting people of African descent and Africans in Diaspora to motherland to be part of its development by investing and experiencing its rich and savoury offerings. Essentially, the major activations of Motherland Beckons cut across tourism, entertainment, arts and culture, as well as security, with different outfits dedicated to executing projects related to each segment. Corporate Guards is one of such outfits, with focus on provision of security services and products across the continent.
 
On the tourism front is La Campagne Beach Resort, which is devoted to developing African themed resort. It has extended this to other parts of Nigeria, with an outfit in Koton Karfi in Kogi State and other parts of Africa such as Cote d’ Ivoire, and Ethiopia. On the economic front, it has developed an economic blueprint known as Diaspora Nigeria Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (DNERGP), which afford Africans in Diaspora and others to invest in Africa and own businesses alongside its Hope, Unity, Rebirth and Prosperity (HURP) programme. As part of this developmental process, African International Music (AIM) Festival was introduced by Motherland Beckons about three years ago to provide a platform for its artistes and other artistes in the creative industry to exhibit their talents, thereby attracting interest from the public and corporate outfits in furthering their growth. Some of the notable artistes under the stable of Atunda Entertainment include Anu the Lady Ekwe, a former beauty queen of Sisi Oge fame, who is Nigerian only Ekwe female instrumentalist; Olo omidan bata, Nigerian only female Bata drummer, Afe Onikoko and Ara (Thunder), who is the only female Igbo talking drummer, singer, choreographer and songwriter.
