Vondrousova, one of three teenagers alongside Amanda Anisimova and Iga Swiatek in the second week at Roland Garros, will face either Estonia’s Kaia Kanepi or Croatian 31st seed Petra Martic in the last eight. “She’s a great player but I played my best tennis today and I’m really happy,” said Vondrousova, who also reached the US Open fourth round last year and won the junior doubles in Paris four years ago. “It was my first junior Grand Slam so I’m in love with this place and I’m enjoying playing here.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
