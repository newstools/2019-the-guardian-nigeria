The Embassy of the State of Kuwaiti during the Eid-el-Kabir celebration put smiles on the faces of no fewer than 1,960 Nigerians who received edible items and gifts in 14 states of the federation. Kuwaiti Ambassador to Nigeria, Mr. Abdulaziz Albisher, in a chat with reporters in Abuja, explained that the gesture was in line with the “Eid Al-Adha Project,” being financed by Zakat House of Kuwait for this year. The envoy disclosed that the gesture was the outcome of a collaborative effort between Mabarra Association of Imams and Preachers just as he listed some the benefitting states to include Kano, Jigawa, Abuja, Kaduna, Niger, Zamfara, Oyo, and Katsina. The envoy specifically mentioned that Internally Displaced People (IDPs) in camps in Katsina State were among the beneficiaries. It would be recalled that the state also shared foodstuff during the last Ramadan fast, a gesture they are used to carrying out over the years.
