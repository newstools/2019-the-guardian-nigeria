 Kenneth Omeruo is set for permanent deal with Laliga’s Leganes.  According to thesun.co.uk, Chelsea are in talks with Leganes over a permanent deal for Omeruo. Leganes did not take up their £6.4 million option on Omeruo but are hoping to land him in a deal worth £4.5 million. Omeruo has a year left on his Stamford Bridge contract and is the longest-serving player at Stamford Bridge. He has teams looking to sign him from France and Turkey, where he had spells with Alanyaspor and Kasımpasa earlier in his career. But he wants to stay in Spain with Leganes and is hopeful of a deal getting struck to remain in La Liga. It has been a wonderful journey. But the journey with Chelsea is going to end now. His seven-year stay in West London is set to come to an end despite the arrival of Frank Lampard as boss. Omeruo told SunSport last month his six loans since 2012 have actually been the making of him. The defender added: “I thought that I would play at Chelsea and make my name. But going there and seeing the types of players arrive plus the club have so much money to spend, you have to accept that it might not happen.“I could have said I would stay and be on the bench but I am a player that wants to play. I want to earn my money. “I think now’s the time for me to leave, to find a place, to be my own man. “I’m married with a baby now, so I need stability. Chelsea have done amazingly for me, and for my family as well. But it’s time when I need to reach my potential. “I stayed in Holland at first with Den Haag for two years. I got injured when I went back but recovered and went to Middlesbrough. “When I went to Turkey I had a great time but being in Spain was my best season as it is a league that everyone watches.“It has been a wonderful journey. But the journey with Chelsea is going to end now.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
