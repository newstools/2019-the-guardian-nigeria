Photo: TWITTER/GIGGLES_24  Speaking with The Guardian yesterday, NBBF Vice President, Babs Ogunade said the federation decided to run around to borrow money to ensure the Nigerian team departed the country to successfully defend the African title the team won in Mali two years ago. Ogunade said D’Tigress would not have been able to attend the African championship if the NBBF continued to wait for the money to be released by the sports ministry. He promised that the NBBF would not relent in ensuring the D’Tigress succeeded in Senegal despite the financial hitches affecting the body. The NBBF vice president disclosed that all logistics to help the Nigerian team excel at the African Basketball Championship had been handled through the borrowed funds. “As you can see, no official from the NBBF traveled with the team to Senegal… only the players and coaches because the body does not have money. “The money the federation borrowed would be able to sustain the team to give their best at the championship. The NBBF is still waiting for the relevant government agencies to release money for the competition. “ I don’t think the financial issues will in any way affect the team’s performance in Senegal,” he said. Ogunade also disclosed that Nigeria’s male team (D’Tigers), who are preparing for the men’s World Cup, will arrive in the country on August 12 to continue preparations for the global championship.
