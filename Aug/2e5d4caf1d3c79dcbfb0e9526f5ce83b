Nigeria’s Presidency Sunday asked organisers and sponsors of the proposed nationwide ‘RevolutionNow’ protest to reveal their identity and not hide under veiled social media posts. “We call on the sponsors and organisers to have the decency to come forward and make their identity known – out of respect to all Nigerians – so that Nigerians can be fully aware in whose name this “revolution” is being proposed and who the beneficiaries may be,” presidential spokesman Gerba Shehu said in a statement. The ‘RevolutionNow’ Saturday became a subject of discussion in Nigeria when operatives of the Department of Security Services (DSS) arrested Sahara Reporters publisher Omoyele Sowore at his Lagos residence. Sowore, presidential candidate of African Action Congress (AAC) in the 2019 general election spearheaded the #RevolutionNow movement, with a plan to hold protests in most Nigerian states on Monday, August 5. Nigeria’s police inspector general Mohammed Adamu Saturday warned citizens to stay clear of the protest in their own interest. He accused the organisers of the protest of plotting to force a regime change in the country. Adamu declared that anyone participating in the protest will be treated as terrorists and enemies of the country, a sentiment shared by the Presidency. Shehu asserted that Nigerians elected President Muhammadu Buhari into office, thus, the action by the protest organisers was aimed at inciting a revolution in government. He stated that the government respects and uphold the right of every Nigerian to peaceful protest and civil campaign to raise awareness on issues and even oppose the government. “There is, however, a difference between peaceful call to protest and incitement for a revolution,” Shehu said. “The ballot box is the only constitutional means of changing government and a president in Nigeria. The days of coups and revolutions are over.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
