 Victor Osimhen (centre) with Lille officials after penning a five-year deal with the French Ligue 1 side.  Osimhen move from Belgian side to Stade Pierre-Mauroy is the latest in his upwards move in the game since he won the 2015 FIFA U-17 World Cup with the Golden Eaglets. The lad, who was in Nigeria’s bronze medal winning team at the Egypt 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, hopes to do better in France than he did at his first professional contract in Germany.He told the club’s official website, “Lille is a very good club that has a quality project and includes high-class players, even more in recent years. “Great Nigerian players have also played here. I would like to join their lineage and follow their footsteps.“I am very happy to be here and to join this great club. I am still young, I am learning and I think that this project suits me perfectly to continue to progress.” Coming on the same day that Lille let their talisman, Pepe join Arsenal for a club record £72 million fee, Osimhen knows that he has an enormous boot to fill.Lille finished in second position in the French Ligue 1 behind Paris Saint Germain last season, and will compete in the Champions League in the 2019/2020 season. Osimhen, who scored 20 times in Belgium last season, believes his joining Lille would help him become better in his aim for progress as the club has a quality project that suits him.
