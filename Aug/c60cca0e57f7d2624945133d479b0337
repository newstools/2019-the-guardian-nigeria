Ikeja Electricity Distribution Company Enilolobo, Obanla and Ajibose communities in Ifo Local Council of Ogun State, are at war with the Ikeja Electricity Distribution Company (IKEDC) over the cruel treatment they get from the company’s officials. The residents told The Guardian that they had been thrown into darkness for the past four weeks because IKEDC disconnected them from the national grid through the transformers feeding the areas. The face-off reportedly started when the communities demanded pre-paid meters and replacement of damaged installations, which legally are properties of the DisCo. “The cables are so bad that one almost killed a schoolgirl on her way to school, when it fell. Apart from the dangers posed to residents, the obsolete cables are disjointed and continue to fall incessantly,” chairman of the youths in the area, Balogun Ismail, said. The residents also accused the sales representative of the area (name withheld) of engaging in underhand dealings and extortion. Head of Corporate Communications, IKEDC, Felix Ofulue, said that it was not right for any IKEDC employee to disconnect consumers based on the issues raised but asked the residents to furnish him with the names of the affected areas so he could assess the situation. But the residents had, in a series of letters, demanded that the company addressed the issues they raised, and that any bill bearing the name of the sales representative should not be honoured. An employee of the company, who preferred anonymity, said they were ordered to shut down the transformers feeding the areas because the communities were obstinate and had refused to pay their bills, a claim the community say is untrue.
