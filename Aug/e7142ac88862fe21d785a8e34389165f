Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council (OYC) yesterday said that with the realisation of Igbo presidency in 2023, the activities of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) would fizzle out like a vapour. In a statement in Abakaliki, the National President of OYC, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, urged other zones to throw their support towards realisation of Igbo presidency. Isiguzoro, who also implored the North to support the Igbo to emerge as President in 2023, urged the northern leaders to ignore the recent antecedents of IPOB towards destroying the trust and endangering the prospect of a Nigerian President of Igbo stock in 2023, maintaining that with realisation of Igbo presidency in 2023, Igbo will be happier.
