 Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi  The Resident Coordinator, Mr. Edward Kallon, disclosed this at a meeting with the state Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi in Ado-Ekiti. He highlighted the pillars of UN reforms in Nigeria to include collective support for government to implement the SDGs; peacebuilding and prevention. Kallon said potential areas of partnership with the Nigerian government included advocacy for legislation on establishment of the National Commission for Peace, Reconciliation, and Mediation, as well as deepening understanding of the SDGs and localisation at the state level, in partnership with the Governors’ forum. Kallon, who hailed Fayemi’s social security programmes, said the UN would work with the state to actualise its SDGs vision. Fayemi stressed the need for Nigeria to address youth employment; inequality, poverty, and insecurity. He expressed his administration’s willingness to work with the UN in the areas of peace-keeping and conflict management. “On advocacy, clearly, we are desirous of close collaboration of the UN systems in order to push for a world of peace, progress and development that can help us address the governance deficits we are dealing with, which undermine sustainable development over the long term,”  Fayemi said, adding that government would soon organise bond to offset outstanding gratuities of pensioners and later find a way of paying back.
