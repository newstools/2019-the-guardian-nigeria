Aaliyah lovers, get ready, the princess of R&B is finally getting her own wax figure. Madame Tussauds Las Vegas throwback room is going to witness an epic wax figure addition in honor of Aaliyah. From August 22, fans can jam and reminisce with the late icon at the museum. Additionally, MTLV is hosting a contest for some lucky fans to attend the VIP launch party. To enter, contestants must share their best Aaliyah-inspired look with the hashtag #ShowUsYourAaliyah on both Instagram and the Aaliyah app. The superstar tragically died in a plane crash at the age of 22 on her way back to the U.S. from her “Rock the Boat” video shoot in the Bahamas.
