The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has ruled out fresh registration of voters who are yet to register for their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) ahead of the November 16 governorship polls in Bayelsa and Kogi states. National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, in a statement in Abuja yesterday disclosed that the decision was made after a review of its level of preparedness for conduct of the elections in both states. “In view of the fact that the commission now conducts nationwide Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise and the tight schedule for the Bayelsa and Kogi governorship elections, INEC will not register new voters, transfer Voters Cards and reprint damaged or defaced PVCs,” Okoye stated.
