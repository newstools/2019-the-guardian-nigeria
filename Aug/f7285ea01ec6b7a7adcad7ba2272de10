Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari Tuesday said he has directed the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to stop providing foreign exchange for importation of food into the country. Buhari made the disclosure when he hosted All Progressives Congress (APC) governors to Eid-el-Kabir lunch at his country home in Daura, Katsina State. “Don’t give a cent to anybody to import food into the country,’’ Buhari said he directed the CBN. Buhari said there was no need for food importation into the country because there had been steady improvement in agricultural production, and attainment of full food security. The Nigerian president said the foreign reserve will be conserved and utilised strictly for diversification of the economy, and not for encouraging more dependence on foreign food import bills. Buhari noted that some Nigerian states- Kebbi, Ogun, Lagos, Jigawa, Ebonyi and Kano had already taken advantage of the government’s policy on agriculture with returns in rice farming. He urged more states to plug into the ongoing revolution to feed the nation. Although insecurity still persists in some Nigerian states but Buhari said his administration has done well in food and physical security. Buhari, however, said he was delighted that young Nigerian graduates had started exploring agric-business and entrepreneurship. Chairman of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum and Ekiti State governor Kayode Fayemi said Buhari had inspired him and other governors on the way forward for security in the country. Fayemi said the states are faced by enormous challenges but the governors had remained undaunted. He assured the President Buhari of strong support and “the very best effort” to overcome all the obstacles. Chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum and Kebbi State governor Atiku Bagudu said the party had been repositioned after the 2019 elections to work for the benefit of the majority of Nigerians.
