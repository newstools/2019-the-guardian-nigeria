 Nicholas Duncan-Williams<br />  The Archbishop gave the admonition at a programme tagged: Two Nights with the King at Liberation City, Berger, Lagos, where he spoke extensively on principles Christians ought to follow to live in abundance. He stressed the need to have the masterkey to unlock doors, saying if Christians tap into it, they could claim supernatural provisions.He said: “In this life, if you don’t have the key, you will just be knocking at doors. But if you have the key, you will be opening any door you want. If you want to see God’s wonder, practise what you believe, practise your faith.” Part of it, according to him, is putting God first in all things, even in tithe and offerings, as well as praying over it before using any part of the remaining 90 per cent, which would ensure the individuals tap into heaven’s provision and financial security. Williams also enjoined Christians to practise their covenant with God and stop giving excuses. He said: “We allow people to confuse us. Giving the tithe first to God establish reverence. It is an acknowledgement of the fact that He has ownership of you and all things yours. It is also a sign that He has ownership of all things. It is a statement of faithfulness and admission that you possess nothing but giving glory to God.” Senior Pastor, Mountain of Liberation and Miracle Ministry, Dr. Chris Okafor said the programme is a yearly event, where God ministers to people’s lives and brings sinners to His Kingdom. He said: “This is a dying and troubled world. Governments of nations have failed; IMF has failed. The only way is God’s way. If they want to follow that way, things will go well. The reason we are having problems is that we are doing it by our power. If they seek the way of Jesus, things will go well. This dying world needs Jesus more than ever.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
