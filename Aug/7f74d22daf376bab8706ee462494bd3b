Tekno. PHOTO: FilterFree The Federal Government has vowed to make Tekno a scapegoat following the Afro-pop star’s release of the controversial music video of “Agege” in-spite of an on-going investigation. The “Pana” singer had previously been arrested and granted bail on health grounds. This came after a public outcry against a viral video in which the singer was seen dancing with semi-nude women in a transparent van along Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge in Lagos. The Director-General, National Council for Arts and Culture, a parastatal of the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture, Segun Runsewe reacted in a statement made on Sunday: “We commend the police for arresting Tekno for the shameful misconduct. The same person, who was granted bail on health grounds has gone ahead to release the controversial video. We are now warning him to desist from this shameful conduct, which is not part of our culture. “No single person is bigger than Nigeria; whether he likes it or not, we are going to use him as a scapegoat to send strong signals that this government does not tolerate nonsense and immorality, but discipline, which is our moral principle. “Since the offensive Tekno scam video came to the limelight, I have received hundreds of telephone calls and SMS from Nigerians at home and others in the United Kingdom, United States, Canada and other parts of the world querying why such anomalies would be tolerated in Nigeria. “Now that he has released the shameful video when investigation is still ongoing, we are going to inform security agencies to place him on their watch list, because his action is a threat to national security and a bad influence on Nigerian youths. “We are committed to exposing proponents of this kind of offensive sights and videos. We warn that nudity is not part of our culture and should not be tolerated. The Federal Government will henceforth fish out clubs for nude dancers across the country for their promoters to face prosecution.”
