Aviation workers’ union yesterday made good their threat to ground all activities at the Newrest Airline Services & Logistics Plc and Skycare Catering Services over alleged anti-labour activities. The clampdown affected in-flight catering services of the two companies at both the Murtala Muhammed Airport in Lagos and Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja. The Guardian learnt that the unionists, under the aegis of National Union of Air Transport Employees (NUATE), stormed offices of Newrest and Skycare in numbers to enforce a picketing order. The union had on Tuesday issued a circular to all workers of the two companies to join in the industrial action from midnight of July 30, 2019. General Secretary of NUATE, Ocheme Aba, said the union was forced to picket the companies when all entreaties failed to resolve issues affecting the workers. Aba alleged against the companies inhuman treatment, unlawful condition of work, non-issuance of employment letters, no terms of engagement or conditions of service. Others sins of the catering companies are “arbitrary terminations of appointments, victimisation on the basis of joining and holding office in a trade union, and refusal to recognize a registered trade union and other forms of enslavement.” Aba said that the actions contravened various Nigerian laws. He said the picketing was taking place simultaneously in airports were ASL have their facilities and would continue indefinitely until the management complied. Neither of the companies has reacted to the industrial action as at press time yesterday. It was gathered that Newrest has lately faced tough times, part of which led to its delisting by the Nigeria Stock Exchange (NSE) last May.
