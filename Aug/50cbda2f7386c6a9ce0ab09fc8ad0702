Nigeria’s anti-graft agency has arraigned the Mrs Isabella Oshodin and Bob Oshodin before a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja for alleged N22.9bn fraud and money laundering. The accused are facing 25 counts for fraudulently receiving the said money from the former National Security Adviser, Col. Sambo Dasuki. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission said Oshodin had on 16 occasions received the money in the sums of N500,000,000; N750,000,000; N125,000,000; N350,000,000; N170,000,000; N85,000,000; N60,000,000; N50,000,000 and others totaling N2.366bn. The anti-graft agency said its investigation also revealed that the defendant on eight occasions received from Dasuki’s ONSA sums totalling $57,217,301.15 into the escrow accounts of Bob Oshodin Organisation Ltd. However, during the court sitting on Monday, the defendant pleaded “not guilty” to the charges when read to her. The counsel for the defendant, Osahor Odemodia, informed the court of the bail application for his client and urged the court to grant her bail on liberal terms, pending the commencement of trial. The trial judge, opposed the application for bail and thereafter, adjourned to August 21, 2019, and ordered the defendant to be remanded in EFCC custody pending the ruling on the bail application.
