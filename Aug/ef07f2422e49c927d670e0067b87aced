The Explosive Ordinance Department (EOD) of the Nigeria Police has uncovered and detonated some bombs left during the 1967-1970 civil war in three states. Construction workers at building sites discovered the explosives in Imo, Delta and Anambra states and reported their findings to the police. Commissioner of Police (CP) in charge of EOD, Maikudi Shehu, disclosed this during his quarterly conference with senior officers and EOD base/unit commanders at his office in Lagos. He said, “Part of our successes after the general elections was the recovery and subsequent detonation of explosives left during the civil war in Anambra, Delta and Imo states. “The explosives were detonated without causing panic. The explosives were many and would have caused a lot of damage if not for the timely intervention of our department.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
