Two suspected Internet fraudsters, Amos Ehi Asuelimen (30) and Kelvin Godwin Ogashi (18), yesterday confessed that they created social media accounts with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and Aisha Muhammadu Buhari’s names to defraud Nigerians. They disclosed this while being paraded by operatives of Edo State Command of the Department of State Services (DSS) in Benin City.
Confessing, Asuelimen said he went into fraud in his bid to pay his bills through school, adding: “Am into fraud because I thought I could raise money to pay my fees and complete my degree course in Business Administration. He admitted to defrauding no fewer than five persons whom he told to send money and recharge cards in order to process their registration and subsequent eligibility for a loan of N100, 000 each. On his part, Ogashi was held in connection with impersonation of Aisha Buhari. While confessing, he said he created an Instagram account using Aisha’s name, adding that he told his victims that the first lady was empowering Nigerian youths with cash to start up their businesses and that interested persons were required to register with some amount of money. While parading the suspects, State Director of Security, Brown Ekwoaba, advised youths who engage in or are contemplating going into crime that there was no short cut to wealth.“They should rather engage themselves on decent productive ventures or risk being arrested and sent to jail by law enforcement agencies,” Ekwoaba said.
