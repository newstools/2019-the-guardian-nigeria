PHOTO: Architecture Lab The family of Pa Abibu Ajibawo Oguntoyinbo of Ipaja, Lagos State has appealed to the governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to rescue them from hoodlums led by an alleged land grabber, Prince Owen Adeniran. Oguntoyinbo, who is head of the family and appointed joint heads of the families of Abiola, Falola, Ilo, lamented that often times, family members had been arrested by policemen from various stations and Zone 2 for offences they did not commit in a bid to harass, intimidate and frustrate them. He said: “It started when the Federal Government acquired about 120 hectares of land located at Ipaja road, Lagos, delineated on Survey plan No, BP 401 A and B dated 21/2/1975 belonging to four families. Forty-one years after, the purpose of the acquisition failed, the family decided to challenge the continued acquisition by the Federal Government. “As an indigent family unable to bear the financial implication of such legal battle, they sought the help of Adeniran to foot the expenses of the recovery. After taking possession of the property successfully, Adeniran and some members of the family began to take unilateral decision on matters that touch on the family land without consulting other accredited representatives of the families. “The families came together and paid Adeniran off by giving him 14 acres for his services in getting their property back through the court. Temporarily, peace was restored but Adeniran with some members of the families began to fabricate a tale claiming they were joint owners of the land.” When our reporter contacted Adeniran on his mobile number, he was not straightforward in his conversation. After admitting that he was Adeniran and indicated that he knew Pa Ajibawo, he again denied that he was not Adeniran.
