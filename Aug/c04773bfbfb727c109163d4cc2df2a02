The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has concluded plans to extend National Identification Number (NIN) enrollment to Nigerians resident in Austria and Germany. Director-General and Chief Executive Officer if NIMC, Aliyu A. Aziz disclosed this in Abuja yesterday. He explained that the exercise will involve demographic and biometric data capture of Nigerians residing in Austria and Germany and will be done in collaboration with Biosec Solution Limited, one of the partners NIMC licensed to carry out enrolment worldwide. Aziz also noted that the extension was to ensure that Nigerians living in The Diaspora were not disenfranchised in the enrollment process, as it was in line with NIMCâ€™s mandate to populate the National Identity Database (NIDB) and issue the NIN to all Nigerians and legal residents.
