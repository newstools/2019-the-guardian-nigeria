 Executive Director, Systemspecs, Deremi Atanda  Ahmad said fintech would help in cross-border payment and bring in more funds from Nigerians abroad into the economy.She added that a large part of the remittances from Nigerians abroad were still in the informal sector, and there was a need to bring them into the formal sector through fintech.  
 
Ahmed, however, said lack of trust of these innovations has hampered financial inclusion.“Looking at the competitiveness of banks and fintech, Africa has the technology it needs to get to where it should. Innovation is good but if is exclusive, it is not what we want,” she added.
