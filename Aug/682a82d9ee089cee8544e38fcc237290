The Reunion tells the story of students four students (played by Lilian Esoro, Tana Adelana, Mercy Aigbe and Mercy Johnson) who came together to celebrate their Alma Matas’ 50th anniversary. During that period, a lot of secrets started unfolding including a rape case, which made them more united in addressing such a serious issue.  “The story means a lot to me; you should stay true to yourself.
