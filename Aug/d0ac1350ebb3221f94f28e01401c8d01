Three serving members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) yesterday died in a motor accident at Gobirawa village in Kankara Local Council of Katsina State. The early morning accident, which occurred due to poor visibility during a heavy downpour, involved a green metallic Volkswagen Sharon bus with plate number MAN 45 AA, belonging to the state chapter of the National Association of Corps Members.
