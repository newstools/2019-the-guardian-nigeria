Vice-Chancellor of Plateau State University (PLASU), Bokkos, Professor Yohana Daniel Izam, has said that the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) has selected the institution among six Nigerian universities to benefit from its high impact interventions worth N3b this year. Izam dropped the hint at the 6th meeting of the congregation of the university he is chairing for the first time since his appointment as Vice-Chancellor of the university on March 1, 2017. In a statement issued by PLASU’s Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the institution yesterday, Mr. John Agam, quoted Izam as saying that funds for the high impact intervention would go a long way towards addressing the university’s infrastructure deficit. He also stated that it would reposition the university for global competitiveness, as it will facilitate the university’s growth and development to catch up with other universities in the country.
