 The “Famous” crooner on Wednesday gifted his former manager, John Monpoly with a customised 2019 Lamborghini SUV for his birthday. West showed up for Monopoly’s birthday party at Delilah in WeHo on Wednesday night with the brand new luxury ride fresh off the lot. It is gathered that the customised SUV with the matte-black paint job goes for around N109,164,000 ($300k) and Monopoly himself confirms that he didn’t even see it coming. In a chat with the celebrity gossip site, TMZ, Monopoly revealed that he got the gift from a “very good guy” and brother of his with whom he goes back 30 years. Although he never dropped a name as to who gave him the expensive car, it was pretty easy to figure out. John Monopoly and the Lambo Monopoly discovered West and served as his manager for his first three albums.
