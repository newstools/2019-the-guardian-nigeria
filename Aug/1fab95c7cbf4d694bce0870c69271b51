Authorities in Istanbul have banned the “Queer Olympix”, organisers said Saturday, becoming the latest pro-LGBT event to be cancelled in Turkey. Some 130 participants were to compete in the third annual Queer Olympix this weekend in sports including football, beach volleyball and long jump, volunteer organiser Elif Kaya said.

It is the first time the event, which began in 2017, has been cancelled by authorities. The organisers said in a statement on Instagram that the event was banned by “the Kadikoy district governorate as a precaution against the provocations that may occur due to social sensitivities”. “The reason given is to prevent possible crimes; to protect public health, public order, and public morality.” Kaya said that the authorities “waited until the minute to tell us about the ban to avoid us appealing”.
