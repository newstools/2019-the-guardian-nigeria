He suffered a similar problem in May at the end of an injury-ravaged first season in Barcelona. He is the latest casualty in a depleted Barcelona strike force. Lionel Messi missed the Liga opener in Bilbao on Friday, which Barcelona lost 1-0, with a calf problem. Uruguayan star Luis Suarez limped off after 37 minutes in Bilbao, also with a calf problem, and is expected to be absent for a month. Barcelona has loaned attacking midfielder Philippe Coutinho to Bayern Munich but is reportedly in negotiations to buy Neymar back from Paris Saint-Germain.
