 Minister of Science and Technology, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu  Onu disclosed this while addressing supervising directors, heads of agencies and members of staff of the ministry in Abuja. “There is no way you can move Nigeria out of poverty without the inputs of science and technology. “It is science, technology and innovation that will help us to create new technologies and those new technologies will now be the basis of a new status. That is to say, new enterprises and entrepreneurs will now grow by using those new technologies,” he said. He further explained that the smaller businesses would grow from medium to large scale, thereby enhancing wealth creation, poverty alleviation, and improvement in Gross Domestic Products (GDP).
