 National President of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) Rev. Samson Ayokunle  He made this assertion in his paper at the Anti-Corruption Town Hall meeting organised by Peering Advocacy and Advancement Centre in Africa (PAACA) in Uyo, the state capital. Theme of the meeting was ‘Strengthening the Moral Institutions in Building a Corrupt-free Society’. According to Ekwere, the time has come for religious organisations to use their influence over people’s conscience to address moral decadence, including corruption. “Nigeria needs religious leaders and groups of serious persons who will spearhead the moral revolution and ethical re-orientation. “Religious organisations can use their influence to bridge the gap between religious ritualism and social morality. “Nigeria is becoming a more dangerous place with the loss of good moral values and the emergence of leaders who concentrate on wealth and power, disregarding the needs of the young and future generations,” he said. He added that bad morals constitute sin and should be condemned in the churches. “People who are contented with what God has given them will not seek to have what is beyond their income.” Earlier, the executive director of PAACA, Mr. Ezenwa Nwagu, had called on religious leaders to lend their voices to the corruption war in the country. He stated the importance of traditional rulers in the anti-graft war. “The traditional rulers have a lot of influence to oversee if a borehole meant for the community is not working well. We are losing the war against corruption without the involvement of traditional rulers,” he said. The workshop drew participants from diverse religious and political groups.
