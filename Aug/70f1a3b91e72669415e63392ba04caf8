 5G Network  Nigeria’s Communications Commission (NCC) this week approved the spectrum for the trial of 5G services in the country. 5G networks are the latest generation of mobile internet connectivity. They offer faster speeds and more reliable connections on smartphones and other devices than previous networks. They combine cutting-edge network technology that is faster than current connections, with average download speeds of around 1GBps as a norm. The networks will help power a huge rise in the Internet of Things technology, providing the infrastructure needed to carry huge amounts of data, allowing for a smarter and more connected world. 5G networks are already starting to appear and are expected to launch across the world by 2020, working alongside existing 3G and 4G technology to provide speedier internet connections. With the current 4G network, Nigeria’s existing digital infrastructures has had its challenges in delivering a hitch-free service for broadband deployment in every part of the country. While the news has been greeted with excitement, there have been some fears regarding the country’s preparedness for the network. An IT expert, Jide Awe said it was imperative for Nigeria to adopt the 5G network to enhance its digital economy in Nigeria but expressed doubts of a hitch-free operation in Nigeria. Awe said that the government needed to create an enabling environment for telecoms providers to access equipment needed. “We are talking about having a new digital economy and the 5G network will help power such but from my own point of view, we are not ready to adopt the use of 5G.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
