The Plateau State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal has reserved judgement in the case between Jeremiah Useni and Governor Simon Lalong to a date to be communicated to the counsel after the parties adopted their final written addresses. Lead counsel to Lalong, Mr. Lateef Fagbemi (SAN), told the tribunal in the adoption of his written address that although he relied on his address, the petitioners failed to provide any entitlement to any of the reliefs sought. Fagbemi also told the tribunal that there were 742 polling units and 69 wards in the state, adding that the 71 witnesses the petitioners called to bolster their petition performed poorly, urging the tribunal to discountenance the petition and their evidence. Counsel to the All Progressives Congress (APC), Garba Pwul (SAN), supported Fagbemiâ€™s submissions, but urged the tribunal to hold that Lalong was qualified to contest the election that he eventually won, asking the tribunal to dismiss the ground challenging his qualification.
