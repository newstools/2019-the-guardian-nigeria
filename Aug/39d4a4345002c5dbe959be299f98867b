Stakeholders in the Lagos State chapter of National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) have called on the governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and other political leaders in the state to move to avert what they tagged “imminent uncontrollable bloody and civil unrest by some disgruntled members over the union’s election coming soon. The concerned members of the union, who spoke with newsmen in Lagos, alleged that a popular union leader in the state based in Oshodi, is making moves to impose himself as the next chairman of the body following the elevation of the incumbent chairman, Tajudeen Agbede, as the National Vice Chairman of the body. The stakeholders said attempts by the said union leader to impose himself as chairman of the union in the state may lead to anarchy and unrest among members of the union and the state at large. To avoid what they termed as ‘imminent uncontrollable unrest in the state’, the stakeholders called on said kingpin to respect the union’s constitution and the zoning system arrangement made by the parties.
