The Yobe State Ministry of Health, World Health Organisation (WHO) and Consortium have planned to immunise 190,000 children against malaria by delivering seasonal malaria prophylaxis to six local councils. The targeted children, who are between age of three and 59 months, are living in 60 wards of Yusufari, Tarmuwa, Bade, Machina, Nguru and Karasuwa local councils. This was disclosed in WHOâ€™s weekly report released yesterday to journalists in Maiduguri. According to the report, the targeted six councils recorded highest malaria cases last year in Yobe State. The state is also one of three mostly affected by the ongoing humanitarian emergencies in North-East. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
