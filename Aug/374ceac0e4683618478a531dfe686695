On September 10 in the Dnipro Arena, the Eagles will meet the Ukrainians in an international friendly aimed at giving some of the fringe players the opportunity to stake their claim to the side. Among the 23 players invited to be part of the squad now to be led by Saudi Arabia-based Ahmed Musa, are Tyronne Ebuehi, who missed the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations finals due to injury, Oluwasemilogo Ajayi and Kelechi Iheanacho, who were also not picked for the Nations Cup.
 
England–based duo Alex Iwobi and Iheanacho have been listed in midfield roles in the team, which will see Germany–based goalkeeper Emil Maduka Okoye and Scotland–based Joe Aribo getting their first call ups. South Africa–based goalkeeper, Daniel Akpeyi is the most high profile omission from the squad, which has Francis Uzoho and Ikechukwu Ezenwa, as the other two goalkeepers. Nations Cup stalwarts, William Ekong, Kenneth Omeruo, Leon Balogun and Jamilu Collins are among the defenders, while midfielders, Wilfred Ndidi, and Oghenekaro Etebo and forwards, Victor Osimhen, Moses Simon, Henry Onyekuru and Samuel Chukwueze are also in the team.
 
Also in the team are Olaoluwa Aina (Torino FC, Italy); Chidozie Awaziem (FC Porto, Portugal); Samuel Kalu (Girondins Bordeaux, France); and Paul Onuachu (FC Midtjyland, Denmark).  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
