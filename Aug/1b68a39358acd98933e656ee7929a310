Black Apple iPhone | Photo: Pexels When it comes to everything relating to technology, a major concern is usually one’s “Privacy” which most of these so-called tech-giants falter on. Surprisingly, Apple falls under such a category. Its well-earned reputation for protecting the privacy and actual controls it provides to users to handle their data settings are weak, opaque, or nonexistent. It’s ironic because Apple has a much better set of default technologies and policies when it comes to user data. In general, this issue where Siri recordings are saved on Apple servers —though anonymous— has revealed a new problem, one that Apple is going to need to do a better job of handling as it shifts more and more of its businesses to services. Unfortunately, its general privacy page is a big set of very clear explanations of what Apple’s policies are, but no specific information on your data or checkboxes to delete it. Luckily, there’s a way to correct the issue of saved voice data on an iPhone, in these four simple steps, but you’ll need to repeat similar processes on every Apple device you own.
