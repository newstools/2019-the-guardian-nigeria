 A photo provided by the Kuwaiti news agency KUNA on August 18, 2019, shows Kuwait’s Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Khaled al-Sabah (R), meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Kuwait City. STRINGER / KUNA / AFP  Sheikh Sabah, who ascended to power in January 2006, was seen in public last week during Muslim prayers and appeared in good health. There has been no word on the emir’s health in official media or Kuwaiti newspapers, though it is commonly made public if he is admitted to hospital or travels abroad for treatment. “Good talks with Kuwaiti crown prince (Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad Al-Sabah) and foreign minister. Praying for Emir’s speedy recovery,” Zarif wrote on Twitter. Zarif said that during the talks, he stressed that Iran’s proposal for a regional dialogue forum and non-aggression pact would eliminate the need to rely on foreign powers. Unlike its strained relations with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Iran maintains good ties with Kuwait, which has acted as mediator to improve ties between Tehran and Arab Gulf states. Sheikh Sabah had a pacemaker implanted in 2000 and underwent a successful urinary tract surgery in the United States in August 2007.
