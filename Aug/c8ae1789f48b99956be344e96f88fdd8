Every week on the Big Brother Naija 2019 show sees a housemate get evicted from the show and last week saw four housemates put up for eviction. Mike, Tacha, Omashola, and Jeff were up for possible eviction and during last night’s eviction show, viewers watched Jeff leave the show after scoring the lowest votes. As usual, we have compiled quick facts about the evicted housemate, Jeff. BBNaija Jeff | Photo – Bukas Blog
