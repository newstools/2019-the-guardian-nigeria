Weekends in Lagos are usually fun because there is always a thing or two events one can be a part of. As usual, we have an amazing lineup of events that we feel should be on your radar: Afro Culture. Afro Future This event is set to gather top dancers and emerging Choreographers from various states in Nigeria for a one-week long workshop. It also aims to investigate Afrofutures in thought, in form, in aesthetics, in questions, in methods and soundscapes.
