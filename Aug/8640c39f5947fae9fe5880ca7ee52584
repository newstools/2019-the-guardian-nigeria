People in relationships are meant to be totally open with each other; however, there are instances where boundaries come. Boundaries are necessary, and there is nothing about them that says they must be rigid. Here are some boundaries that should be set in any relationship: Expectations It is important that you discuss your expectations with your partner. A lot of people enter relationships putting the burden of healing or completing them onto someone else.Â  However, we all have needs and cannot be a god or goddess of healing and perfection to others. There should be a good balance in regards to give and take. Let them know the extent you can go and what they should do. Tolerance It is important you let your partners know what you can tolerate in a relationship. Let them know if even the basic negative things turn you off like lies, cheating, lack of communication or disloyalty. By doing so, your partner understands that these things need to be avoided. Sexual boundaries People have different sexual expectations, it is important to let them know your sexual preferences and what you might not indulge in. This helps you know if you determine whether or not you both are sexually compatible. Do you enjoy morning sex or a spontaneous person? Are there certain positions you will choose over another? Talk about things like this and find a way to strike a balance. Financial Discussing your financial boundaries is very important. It helps you avoid getting into a tangled situation later on in the relationship. Do you live on a budget while your partner enjoys being lavish? (and vice versa). Boundaries are just as important as every other necessary thing one needs to get right in a relationship.
