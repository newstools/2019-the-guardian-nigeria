Nigerian singer, Tiwa Savage has been teasing her fans on her social media pages hinting that new music is on the way. In her latest post, the talented singer hinted that her first official global single would be released on the 5th of September. The single is to be titled “49-99”. Not only is the title unusual, the “Ma Lo” crooner says it is going to be different.  We also believe that an album is on the way. Going by Tiwa Savage’s management, Efe Ogbeni, the project would be titled “The Shift”.

The upcoming project would be a follow-up to her last body of work, Sugarcane EP which was released in 2017. The EP featured hit songs such as All Over, Me and You, Ma Lo and many others. Efe Ogbeni took to his Instagram page to announce the upcoming project. It appears that Tiwa Savage’s next album would focus on women. He posted;
