Mr Ibrahim Shawai, the Communication officer, Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO), has debunked rumours of a three-day power outage in Kano and its environs. Shawai, who denied the rumour in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday in Kano, said that there was no total power outage in any of the three states under his company’s jurisdiction. NAN reports that the three states under KEDCO jurisdiction are Kano, Katsina and Jigawa. “We only know that there are some areas like Unguwa Uku, Naibawa and Karkasara areas where their feeders had problem but we have moved them to the lines that supply the light to the NNPC depot located in Hotoro,” he said. The communication officer said that the distribution of electricity had only reduced following the reduction of the power generation in the country. He said: “there are some areas in Jigawa and Katsina States that have problems with their light which is as a result of the collapse of poles caused by the recent heavy rainfall. “Also in Jigawa State, there is a problem with a particular feeder which is under the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), and they are presently working on it.” Shawai commended the people of the three states for their usual support for the company, assuring them of KEDCO’s commitment to regular power supply.
