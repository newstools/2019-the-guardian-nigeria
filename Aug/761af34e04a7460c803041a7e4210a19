A representative for the social media giant says it will begin small-scale tests with four partners. They include BBC, College Humour’s Dropout and Taste made Plus. According to ‘Variety,’ subscription prices will be the same as what other services charge per month to watch College Humour or Taste made. The test is expected to debut over the next month and only be available to American users of Facebook. “We’re excited to bring more of people’s favourite shows and videos to Facebook, where subscribers can enjoy the content together with other fans. We’ll be listening to feedback from our community”, Facebook representative, via statement. Facebook adds that more partners could be included in the subscription test as it progresses. The new service is being thought of as an expansion of ‘Facebook Watch,’ a video-on-demand service launched in 2017. As many as 140 million global users are said to be using ‘Watch’ to tune in to shows like Jada Pinkett Smith’s ‘Red Table Talk.’
