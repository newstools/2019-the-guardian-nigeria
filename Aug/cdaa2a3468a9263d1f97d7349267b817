 [FILES] Shehu Sani  Eighth Assembly Senator who represented Kaduna Central, Shehu Sani has denied being the North campaign coordinator for a certain Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu presidential aspiration ahead of 2023. Sani who spoke during an interactive session organised by the correspondent chapel of the Nigeria Union of Journalists FCT Council, said he was not aware of Tinubu’s aspiration, let alone being appointed its coordinator in the North. “I can tell you that, that is a false, fake phony story, it never happened,” Sani stated. He said for the South to clinch the 2023 Presidency, the unity of the two regions (Southeast and Southwest) is sacrosanct, adding that they must agree to present a common front. Sani said the ruling class is unyielding to ideas of rotational presidency, and it would take only a united southern region to press home this political solution adopted for all parts of the country to feel a sense of belonging in the governance of Nigeria. He said while it may be unfair for the North to hold unto power come 2023, the southern bloc must unite to confront this posture of those in power, as against regional campaign on who is qualified or otherwise to run for 2023 from the south. “It will be unfair for other sections of the country if one section uses its topographical or demographic advantage to hold unto power. Knowing that it was not the topography or demographic advantage that delivered them to power. “Rotation of power is what I prescribe and stood for, whether that power goes to the east or west, it is dependent on the people from the south. “What I will say is that there is a possibility of producing a Northern president in 2023, if the east and the west remain divided in their resolve on governance of the Country,” he said.
