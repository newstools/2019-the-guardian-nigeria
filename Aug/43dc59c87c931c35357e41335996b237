The Ekiti State government yesterday began the evacuation of destitute and mentally-sick persons off the street of the state capital, Ado-Ekiti and its environs. The evacuation took the team of the Office for Disability Affairs in the Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development to communities such as Ikere-Ekiti where mentally-unstable persons were picked up and taken to a rehabilitation centre in Ado-Ekiti. The Commissioner for Women Affairs and Social Development, Mrs. Mojisola Fafure, whose ministry supervises the office for disability affairs, said the raid was meant to clear the street of destitute persons, who have become an eyesore to the state. The commissioner assured Ekiti residents that the raid would be a continuous exercise and would be taken to every community in Ekiti. Speaking with newsmen, the Executive Secretary, Office for Disability Affairs, Dr. Ayodele Ibikunle, explained that those apprehended were moved to rehabilitation homes where government would be responsible for their upkeep. He said the state government was particular about their welfare and would train some of them in artisanship. It was like a dramatic scene in some places visited as government officials scouted and captured the destitute persons with force, especially those who were not willing to cooperate. While some of them cooperated with the officers, others resisted attempt to be taken away, thereby creating a scene.
