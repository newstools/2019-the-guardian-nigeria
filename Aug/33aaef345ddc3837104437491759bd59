The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) in Bayelsa State has sealed nine petrol stations and an illegal Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) filling station in Yenagoa for various offences. Some of the offences include under-dispensing and lack of basic operational and safety equipment. The agency carried out the action yesterday when a team of its officials, led by Mr. Ibinabo Jack, Head of Operations in the state field office, paid an unscheduled visit to many of the outlets. Ibinabo, who spoke with newsmen, said: “So, it’s not new and it’s not just one-off take. It is a continuous exercise.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
