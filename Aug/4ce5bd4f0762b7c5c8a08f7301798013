 [FILES] Osun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola  Oyetola has been criticized by opposition figures and some analysts for being slow to name his cabinet or articulate economic policies since his victory over Ademola Adeleke of the People’s Democratic Party. However, Oyetola’s Senior Special Assistant on Strategic Communications, Charles Adeyemi, in a chat with The Guardian said there is “no vacuum” in the state government. “People have been working,” Adeyemi said. “It is just that in our clime, people are conscious of title.” “There has not been vacuum in leadership, the supervisory commissioners have been working audaciously with the governor,” he added. At least eight of the former governor Rauf Aregbesola’s commissioners are presently “supervising” the ministries they ran under the former governor. Adeyemi noted that necessary approvals were granted by the state’s sixth assembly before its end of tenure. Adeyemi added that the governor is at his best to strengthen the security in the state adding that the bandits that migrated from Zamfara and some other northern states to Osun have all been “wiped out.” Oyetola in April said security report made available to him revealed that some bandits displaced in Zamfara State had moved to Osun State. The governor subsequently launched a special security outfit, Operation Puff Adder, to put in place to combat crime in the Osun State Police Command.
