The highly anticipated album Woman of Steel of Yemi Alade otherwise and popularly known as Mama Africa is finally here! As expected, Alade exhibits amazing dexterity, vocal power, emotional precision, and smooth transitions on this album. The album is a perfect blend of different genres; from a Latino vibe in “Give Dem”, Afrobeat numbers like “Vibe”, “Nobody” and highlife gems like “Yeba”, the provocative Duncan Mighty duet “Shake” among others give the album that unapologetic African tone expected from the renowned Mama Africa. Woman of Steel boasts a modern remake of Angélique Kidjo‘s classic “Wombo Lombo” christened “Shekere”, with the iconic multiple Grammy Award winner. Yemi Alade’s “Woman of Steel” album tracklist In “Home”, Alade promises to follow her love interest to the ends of the world. She sings about unrequited love on “Nobody”, assuring her love interest that no one will love him the way she does. Diving deep into the African-highlife, Alade links up with Nollywood mega-star, Funke Akindele on “Poverty”, rejecting the “disease” while also stressing that she is working really hard to be the richest possible version of herself while proclaiming prosperity and good health. What’s a Mama Africa album without throwing in a few bonus tracks!? Staying true to her fashion,  Alade includes a Swahili version of “Poverty” and of course the grand remix of “Oh My Gosh” which features Grammy-nominated rapper, Rick Ross. “Woman of Steel” is Alade’s fourth studio album following “Black Magic”, “Mama Africa”, and “King of Queens”.
