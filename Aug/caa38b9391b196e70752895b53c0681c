The Lagos State Signage & Advertisement Agency (LASAA) has suspended, pending final investigation, the practicing Licence issued to Provision Media System Limited over indecent advertisement. The company, whose unregistered mobile advertising truck allegedly has no valid registration for 2019, was accused of engaging in abysmally debasing projection of semi-nude women for several hours around the Lekki/Ikoyi tollgate. According to a statement signed by Managing Director/CEO, LASAA, Mobolaji Sanusi, the agency having gone through its records for the current year could confirm that the truck with Lagos State plate number-APP 713 XL is not registered with the agency for the deplorable purpose for which it was deployed by the company on Saturday. “We wish to state, without equivocation that, no outdoor mobile advert truck within the jurisdiction of our dear state is licensed to display such crass immorality of the calibre that the owner(s) of this unregistered truck exhibited on our roads over the weekend. “The government of Lagos State, under the leadership of Governor Babajide Sanwoolu, has zero tolerance for any slightest attempt by anyone, under whatever guise, to debase the moral fabric of our dear state. Nobody/company can hide under the guise of engaging in outdoor advertising business to display obscenity that is antithetical to our cherished cultural and moral values,” the statement read. He assured that the full weight of the law, as enshrined in the agency’s extant law, will be meted on the company after due investigations must have been concluded.
