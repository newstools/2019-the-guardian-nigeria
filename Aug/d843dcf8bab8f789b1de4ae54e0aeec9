 Miracle David of Jacob Esuene Sports Club (JESC), Akwa Ibom State met with Emmanuel Ogbemi of Edo State in the second round of the U-10 category of the JESC Junior and Inter-Club Squash Tournament in Eket, Akwa Ibom State…yesterday.  Nimrod said the NVBF board decided to attend the second edition of the Snow Volleyball Tour as part of its plans to make the game more popular, adding that the team will make a meaningful impact in Argentina. “The Nigeria Volleyball Federation is taking a huge step as we will be participating in the 2019 FIVB Snow Volleyball World Tour. Few months ago, we took part in the World Beach Volleyball Championships in Hamburg, Germany and made positive mark there. “I have confidence in this team and what they are capable of doing. Volleyball is one of the greatest known unifying factors among our peoples across different boundaries, and success at the tour will help to further solidify our unity in the federation and country at large,” he declared. Nimrod said the federation decided “to take these unprecedented steps because it means a lot to the board of Nigeria Volleyball Federation as one of our mandates is to reposition volleyball in the world; as well as make it one of the most popular sports in Nigeria.” The volleyball president also called on corporate bodies to assist the federation in funding some of the programmes lined up in its calendar. “The country will be attending the 2019 CAVB Zone Three Nations Cup in Ghana and the U19 team will also attend the World Championships in Tunisia in the month of August; all these we have to attend if Nigeria wants to remain relevant in the game of volleyball,” he added.
