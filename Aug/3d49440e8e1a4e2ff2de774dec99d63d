Director General (NITDA), Pantami. Photo/Twitter/nitdanigeria National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) has launched five new regulatory instruments to address fundamental issues in Nigeria’s ICT sector. Dr Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, director general, NITDA at the launch in Abuja, said that the agency’s activities should be geared towards the development of ICT and its integration to implement socio-economic agenda of the government at all levels. ‘’We would not by any means stifle ICT development especially to the detriment of our indigenous IT companies… It is on this conviction that we are building a strong foundation for ICT development, adoption and grown through effective regulation’’, he said. He said NITDA’s regulatory instruments had also helped boost local patronage and had provided thousands of jobs in the country. Nigeria, he said, was on the path of producing many Zuckerbergs as many IT start-ups were springing up across the country by the day. He said the newly launched five regulatory instruments would enhance the country’s e-governance, promote digital learning, promote industrialisation and create more jobs for the youths. The five regulatory instruments launched were: Guidelines for Nigeria Content Development in Information and Communication (ICT) as amended; Nigeria e-government interoperability framework (Ne-GIF); Nigeria ICT Innovation and Entrepreneurship Vision; Nigeria Cloud Computing Policy (NCCP); and Framework and Guidelines for ICT Adoption for Tertiary Institutions. Governor Abdullah Sule of Nasarawa state who was at the launch of the instruments said they would go along away in helping him industrialise Nasarawa state.
