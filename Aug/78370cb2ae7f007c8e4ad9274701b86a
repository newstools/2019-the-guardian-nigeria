SUNDAY DARE Irked by the deplorable condition of the nation’s sports facilities, the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Akin Dare has pledged to give a facelift to them in order to raise sporting standards. Speaking while inspecting the Ahmadu Bello Stadium (ABS) in Kaduna yesterday, where he applauded the maintenance culture of the facilities and the state of the stadium, Dare said, “what I have seen today is not disappointing but, there is room for improvement on the facility.” Dare was pleased that even though the Ahmadu Bello Stadium has been existing for more than 50 years ago, it is still in good condition. The minister pledged to ensure that all the stadia owned by the Federal Government would be turned into modern sports centres for youth development, through public private partnership. He also promised to focus more on youth development for talents discovery. “We are going to look at what has worked, what didn’t work, and have a meeting point to perfect those areas that are lacking. “For us to right the wrongs, we will take tough decisions and also be confrontational when necessary,” he said. Meanwhile, the facilities inspected by the minister at the Ahmadu Bello Stadium included the football playing pitch, swimming pool, indoor games hall and hostels, among others.
