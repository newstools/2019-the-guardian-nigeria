 Ayomide on hospital bed  Ayomide, who was said to be a brilliant and first-class student, is at the last stage of kidney disease and needs N10m for a kidney transplant. She was said to have suddenly become sick early in the year and she did all her best to get medical attention in the university clinic. She was diagnosed with renal failure in April at the Teaching Hospital. Since then, she has been placed on dialysis otherwise known as renal replacement therapy. “I want to live, please save my life. My father had died and my mother is too old to raise such amount. I’ve been struggling to achieve my dream, yet, I believe in God in this uncertain condition,” she struggles to say on her sickbed. Dr. M.A Olamoyegun of the Teaching Hospital said she is currently on maintenance hemodialysis, which she undergoes three times per week and each session costs about N35,000. This amounts to N105,000 per week excluding the cost of medications. In a letter made available to The Guardian, Olamoyegun disclosed that a definitive plan for her condition is kidney transplantation, which costs N10m. The transplant is to be carried out at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital (OAUTH), Ile Ife, in Osun State. So far, N2m  has been raised mostly by her friends and fellow students,  leaving her with N8m to undergo a kidney transplant. She has also got a donor certified medically fit but she is yet to get the financial support for the operation. Meanwhile, part of the N2m is being used for her dialysis. She is calling on corporate organisations, kind-hearted Nigerian and non-governmental organisations to assist her, considering the crucial stage of her ailment.
