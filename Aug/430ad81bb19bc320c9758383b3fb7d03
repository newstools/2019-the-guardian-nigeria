By its very nature, it’s always a time of political clashes,” Duda said in an interview with television channel Polsat News. “I think Poles would like to see as few as possible of these clashes. Hence the earliest possible date. Which is why I proposed October 13 to the electoral commission.” Duda is an ally of the governing conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, which has been in power since late 2015. Campaigning on a platform of generous social spending, PiS appears on track to win a second consecutive term in the general election, according to recent opinion polls.
