Collapsed bridge at Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi…PHOTO: Rauf Oyewole, Bauchi Four students of the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Gubi, Bauchi, Tuesday died when a bridge they were walking within the school campus collapsed. The bridge collapsed after a heavy downpour with about 20 students on it when the tragedy struck, according to students. The students have since trooped to the school gate to express dissatisfaction to the school authority over the incident. “Joseph, my roommate was among those who were returning from library to hostel when the iron bridge collapsed,” a student told The Guardian. “We recovered textbooks, wrappers and some of them are still missing.” “All calls put across to the management asking them to come for help were not responded to,” an eyewitness said. “Four of our students died – three females and a male. Some are in the hospital and there are still some that have not been found.” The police in Bauchi confirmed the development and referred journalists to the University’s public relations unit for details. When our correspondent visited the scene of the accident, the school security and students were searching for missing victims underwater where the iron bridge collapsed. Police officials were also on the scene to manage the situation. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
