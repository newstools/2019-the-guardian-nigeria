This year’s Primetime Emmy telecast is set to hold without a host. Fox Entertainment CEO Charlie Collier confirmed the news on Wednesday morning during the network’s portion of the Television Critics Assn. press tour, Variety reports. With just a month and a half to go before the event, securing a host at this late date would have been unlikely (though not impossible). This will be the first time since 2003nthat the show will go without a host. According to Collier, this decision will allow for Emmy’s limited time to be better distributed. "You have to look at tradeoffs if you have a host an opening number that's 15 minutes you don't have to celebrate the shows. Our production team has had to balance those tradeoffs. I think it will give us more time to honour those shows", Charlie Collier said. The move was apparently inspired by the success of the 2019 Oscars, which also went without a host. "That was something we paid attention to. This is a unique year for some of America's favourite shows and producers came to the conclusion that spending more time on those was the right thing to do", Charlie Collier to The Hollywood Reporter. The Emmys are set to air on September 22, 2019.
