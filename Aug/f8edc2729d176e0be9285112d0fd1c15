Operatives of the Lagos State police command Thursday arrested a woman identified as Onyinye Mbadike who was seen in a viral video detaining a boy in a dog cage. In the video, a woman suspected to be Mbadike was seen assaulting a boy identified as Chinke Eziamaka. The boy was flogged with a belt and later was locked him in up in the dog kennel. “On August 14, 2019, a team of detectives from the Gender Unit, Command Headquarters, Ikeja, arrested one Onyinye Mbadike, 24, of No 7 Trimnell Street, Aguda for assault and child abuse,” Lagos police spokesman, Bala Elkana said on Thursday. “This followed a viral video on the social media showing the suspect torturing one Chibike EziAmaka 10, of same address.” Bala further stated that Mbadike admitted she is the one on the viral video flogging the child with a belt, but she denied locking the survivor in a cage with dogs that she only locked him in an empty dog kennel where bags are kept. “Investigation revealed that the survivor lost his parents and was brought to Lagos in 2012 from Anambra State by the Mother of the suspect along with his two siblings,” he said Bala said the suspect’s mother is the elder sister of the boy’s father. She claimed the boy took a hot drink in their Refrigerator and smashed the side mirror of her Toyota Camry with stone, which made her detain him in the dog kennel. “She claimed to have locked up the boy for a few hours before bringing him out.” He said the suspect would be charged to Court as the 10years old boy has since been rescued and taken to a secured shelter To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
