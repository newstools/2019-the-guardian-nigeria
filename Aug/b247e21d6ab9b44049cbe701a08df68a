The Court of Appeal, Port Harcourt has fixed August 20, 2019, for hearing in the appeals filed by the Action Democratic Party (ADP) and its candidate, Victor Fingesi, against the rulings of the Rivers State governorship election petitions tribunal sitting in the capital. The three-man trial tribunal, led by Justice J.A. Orjiako, had on July 4 struck out some paragraphs of ADPâ€™s petition and directed that the party file clean copies of the same petition. The court also declined to grant ADP the leave to amend some clerical errors. Dissatisfied by the rulings, the party and its standard-bearer filed two appeals before the appellant court.
