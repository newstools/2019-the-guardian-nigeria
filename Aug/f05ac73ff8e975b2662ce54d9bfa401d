Forty expectant and nursing mothers have received neonatal kits at the Primary Health Centre (PHC), Mile 2, Amuwo-Odofin, Lagos, while the facility also got two weighing scales for babies by the Rotary Club of Lagos West. In addition, 10 others were empowered with sewing and grinding machines while interest-free loans were disbursed to four indigent women to advance their businesses. The occasion was the maiden visit of the District 9110 Governor, Dr. Jide Akeredolu, to the club. Akeredolu scored the club highly in the area of membership, Rotary Foundation and service projects, and was well on its way to getting the presidential citation, which is the badge of honour as a successful club if it carried out all its outlined projects. The club president, Rtn. Vincent Okechukwu, promised that the club would accomplish its signature project of sinking a borehole in a public school and renovating an hospital within the community.
