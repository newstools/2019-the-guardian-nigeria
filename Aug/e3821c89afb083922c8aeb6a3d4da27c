Are you ready for a new music album from music genius, Kanye West? If you aren’t ready, it is too late because whether you are ready or not, the multiple Grammy-award winning rapper is releasing his ninth studio album titled, ‘Jesus Is King’ and is reportedly due on September 27. Although fans have been expecting his next album to be, ‘Yandhi’, it appears the LP has been canned in favour of this new record. Kanye West The reality TV star, business mogul and wife to West, Kim Kardashian shared an image of a notebook with a 12-track listing, complete with a title and release date.  The name appears at the top of the paper followed by 12 entries, including ‘Water’, which is a song Kanye debut at his Coachella Sunday Service in April. Underneath that, there is a date, September 27, which fans have speculated could well be the day the 42-year-old star drops his ninth studio album. Kardashian also captioned the post with a prayer emoji.   9.27.19 A post shared by  Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Aug 29, 2019 at 7:24pm PDT  Jesus is King is set to arrive nearly one year after Yandhi was initially expected to drop and has the following tracklist: Glade, Garden, Seleh,
God Is, Baptized, Sierra Canyon, Hands On, Wake the Dead, Water, Through the Valley, Sunday, Sweet Jesus. West last dropped an album in June 2018 when he released eighth record ‘Ye’. Just three months later, he revealed his next album would be called ‘Yandhi’ but the release was then postponed indefinitely. The religion-traversing track list is very en-brand for Yeezus himself, whose weekly Sunday Services see the rapper sing gospel renditions of classics and reworked versions of his own music. There is only a month until the album’s release, so let’s hope it doesn’t do a Yandhi and disappear completely.
