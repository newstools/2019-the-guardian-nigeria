Fashion Focus Africa For 8 years, Heineken Lagos Fashion Week has sought to empower African fashion creatives by presenting them with an opportunity to be scouted, nurtured and awarded a grant to propel their business forward via the Fashion Focus Fund. Fashion Focus Africa has encouraged designers to hone their talent and develop much needed business acumen, that’s crucial for building businesses that can attain commercial success  in Africa and beyond. Programme participants are provided with some mentoring, business and creative workshops. Last year, for the first time, Fashion Focus accepted applications from fashion creatives across Africa, making the programme open to creatives beyond Nigeria. The 2018/2019 programme included finalists from Angola, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and Rwanda. These five designers will also be showing at the Heineken Lagos Fashion Week runway in October. “We understand the challenges that come with establishing a successful fashion business and making it competitive on a global scale. We are committed to providing the necessary tools needed to thrive to the individuals that pass through Fashion Focus Africa.” – commented Founder and Executive Director, Omoyemi Akerele.
