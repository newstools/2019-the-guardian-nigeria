Slather the smoothie into your hair, and let it settle and sink into your scalp for at least five minutes. Thoroughly rinse the mixture out with warm water. Afterwards, take your time to comb through your hair. You want to make sure you have removed any pieces you may not have blended thoroughly. Do a final rinse.
