Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike • Group demands holiday for Islamic New Year
The controversy trailing the demolition of alleged illegal structure on Trans-Amadi Muslims praying ground in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, has deepened with the Muslims faulting Governor Nyesom Wike’s claims. Wike had claimed yesterday that no mosque existed on the praying ground, a statement that a group who claim to be “the Mosque management” described as fallacy of the highest order. Addressing journalists at the location on Biambo Street, Off School Road by Mami Market Junction, the governor said there was no Mosque on the ground, thus nothing was demolished. General secretary of the group, Abubakar Aliyu, told The Guardian yesterday that there was a mosque in that location, although at a foundation stage, as thousands of Muslims gather there every Friday for prayers. He said: “We have an approval to construct (a mosque), but we still cannot unravel the reason for the demolition.” Aliyu added that ‘the mosque management’ had documents and evidences to show that a mosque existed. Meanwhile, the Muslim Community of Lagos State (MCLS) has appealed to the state government to declare the first day of Islamic Hijrah calendar as holiday due to its importance to Muslims. The group noted that some states in the North and Osun in South West had declared the holiday. “We hope our beloved state would follow suit. It is long overdue for the state. The Muslims would hail it and this government would be remembered with gratitude for it forever.” President of MCLS, Prof. Tajudeen Gbadamosi, condemned the rising wave of moral and social vices in the country.
