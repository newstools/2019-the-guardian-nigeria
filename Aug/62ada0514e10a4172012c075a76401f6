Vidal noted that fans applauding in a rhythmic and constant manner, a sound with which all football supporters across the globe can relate to. “Heartbeats and applause are intrinsically linked and bring energy together to generate a state of collective happiness and excitement,” explained Vidal, a one-time Emmy and two-time Goya winner. He said the melody, stands out for the way it brings wind and string instruments together and crescendos. “The main melody, which is played by horns and trumpets with vocals, fluctuates between four chords that look to connect with LaLiga fans’ positive emotions,” Vidal said. “Instruments from different cultures are used in the song in a bid to give it a more universal feel,” he added.
