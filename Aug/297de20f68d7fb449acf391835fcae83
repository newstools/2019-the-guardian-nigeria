One of the first generation banks has assured prompt action to address the alleged assault of one of its customers by its security guards inside the banking hall for threatening to close his account for unsatisfactory service. The client, who was said to have gone to the bank for a transaction on Wednesday, was reportedly beaten mercilessly by some security operatives attached to the Osapa, Lekki, Lagos branch of the bank. A video of how the customer was being assaulted by the security men has been trending on the social media, while some people advise the customer to seek redress in the court over the alleged inhumane treatment against him by the bank. According to sources present at the scene of the incident, trouble started when the victim got involved in a heated argument with another bank customer and refused to leave the banking hall after being told to do so. The said client, who does not seem to like the bank’s position in resolving the dispute between him and the other customer, informed the staff of his intention to close his account with the bank, insisted on doing so immediately and withdrawing money in the account before leaving the hall, a decision that didn’t go down well with the security men, who descended on him and even hit him with gun butt. But reacting to the video, the bank, through its verified Twitter handle, said the matter was being investigated, adding: “Our attention has been drawn to a video posted online of an incident that happened at one of our branches. “The bank is currently investigating this unfortunate incident and will take immediate steps to address both the reasons behind the episode and its fallouts. “We assure the public that our customers remain at the core of our business and we are committed to delivering the highest standards in customer experience across all our touch points.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
