Quavo is working something new and it isn’t a rap track. The ATL rapper is producing an animated series based on the hip-hop scene of his Atlanta stomping grounds. The untitled Marginal Mediaworks show will be geared toward kids in the 8-12 age range. “I have long seen how hip-hop, as well as our music, really impacts kids” Quavo said of the show. “I’ve loved animation my whole life, whether on TV or in movies, and I wanted my first jump into this premium content world to be a show just for kids. It will definitely reflect the creativity, love and families in and around the nawf side of Atlanta, where we grew up.” The Migos frontman will serve as the executive producer of the project and supported by Quality Control’s brand new film and television branch. “What’s important and inspiring to me is that all kids will be seeing themselves in the faces and situations of these episodes,” said Quality Control Music executive Kevin “Coach” Lee.
