In Kaduna State, more than 237 Primary Health Centres (PHCs) have no qualified nurse to attend to the patients. Only four nurses shuttle around 18 of the 255 PHCs in the state. Healthcare experts and civil society organisations working under Partnership for Advocacy in Child and Family Health at Scale (PACFaH@Scale) Project Nigeria revealed that none of the 255 PHCs under renovation had the required number of medical personnel. The group noted that the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) recommended a minimum of 19 health personnel for every PHC. It was also revealed that only three PHCs in the state were offering 24 hours service. Speaking at the 2019 International Conference on Contemporary Issues in Social Science Research held at the Kaduna State University (KASU) themed ‘Health Care, Service Delivery and Quality and Assessment of the 255 PHC in the State’, the project Director of PACFah@Scale, Mustapha Jumare, lamented the poor health service delivery in the state. Jumare, who doubled as the lead presenter at the retreat, said “the ongoing renovation of the 255 PHCs in the state and the review of the 2019 health budget showed significant non-compliance with policy requirements needed for the attainment of universal health coverage for citizens.” He added that Kaduna allocated N2,462,570,274 for primary healthcare centres renovation and construction in its 2019 budget, N15,985,600 for furnishing of three zonal cold stores in Zaria, Kaduna and Kafanchan, and N550 million as counterpart funding. “But since January, the state government has not released any of the fund mentioned.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
