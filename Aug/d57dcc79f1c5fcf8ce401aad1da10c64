 President and Chairman of Council, CIBN, Uche Olowu  “In 2014, JP Morgan Chase, one of the largest banks in America in terms of assets, reported a data breach that affected seven million small businesses and 76 million households. “Another issue of concern is that of consumer consents or rather consent fatigue, where organisations seeking legitimate use of data serve customers with several consent notifications or forms. Customers, without taking the time to fully understand these forms indicate agreement. “By organising this session, we aim to bring to the consciousness of all stakeholders, the importance of data privacy and management via a robust panel discussion, providing measures or best practices to be taken in implementing such standards,” Olowu said. He further noted that the centre, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CIBN, mandated to provide thorough leadership and enlightenment on topical issues affecting the banking and finance industry as well as the economy at large.
