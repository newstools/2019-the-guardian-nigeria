Nigerian-American singer and rapper, Jidenna is a smoking hot chief in the new music video for “Tribe”. The video which was released today gives viewers snippets of life in Jidenna’s tribe. This is coming days after blessing fans with the release of two singles, “Sufi Woman” and “Tribe” from his sophomore album, “85 To Africa”. In the video, Jidenna gives us a tour of his tribe. We are welcomed to a soiree of feasting, dance and merrymaking. And we get to admire his arm length tattoo, which he had revealed to be a combination of Nigerian and Polynesian symbols. Tattoo – top of the year. It’s a combination of Nigerian and Polynesian symbols https://t.co/1L9IakHRPz — Jidenna (@Jidenna) July 11, 2019  Watch Tribe:
