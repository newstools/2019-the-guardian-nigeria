Also summoned alongside the former governor were former Chairman of Association of Local Governments of Nigeria  (ALGON), Mr. Dapo Olagunju; former Commissioner for Local Government Affairs, Mr. Kola Kolade and all the former 16 local council chairmen. The House also summoned a former Speaker of the House, Pastor Kola Oluwawole and some suspended members of the Fifth Assembly over the passage of an N10 billion revised budget proposal towards the end of the tenure of the former governor. Besides, a former aide to Fayose on New Media, Mr. Lere Olayinka, was also directed to appear before the lawmakers for alleged unremittance of commercial revenue of above N13 million while serving as supervisor at the state-owned broadcasting service of Ekiti State. But reacting to the summons, Fayose, who spoke through his media aide, Lere Olayinka, said he would not dignify the Assembly with his presence. Meanwhile, the Ekiti State Government has urged the Transmission of Nigeria (TCN) to build the 330kv power sub-station in the state as a matter of right, to shore up electricity supply. The stateâ€™s Commissioner for Infrastructure and Public Utilities, Mr. Bamidele Faparusi, who spoke with journalists yesterday, said   Ekiti State was the only state being denied the 330kva sub-station facility as some are having more than one.
