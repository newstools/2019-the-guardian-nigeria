 Pharmacy shop stocked with medicines  The group in a statement signed and issued by the Head Pharmacist, Suleman Sule, stressed that community pharmacies remain critical to accessible healthcare in Nigeria. With their head office in Abuja, Sule explained that the aim of Shelf Life is to revolutionise community pharmacy service across the country, adding that the group has its presence in various states of the federation. “There are over 100,000 community pharmacies and drug shops in Nigeria, compared to approximately 26,000 public health facilities. This makes community pharmacy a critical component of accessible healthcare for Nigerians.” According to him, over 100 pharmacies registered in its network have achieved over 96 percent availability on over 500 life-saving medicines and essential products. He noted that beyond Nigeria, it also extends its services to other nations in Africa. Sule further explained that in the last eight months, Shelf Life has selectively added 33 additional outlets to its Lagos network, stressing that the growth is possible because they solve a key and pervasive problem for pharmacies. Timeyin Ogungbe of Elbeth Pharmacy described the relationship as a true partnership, noting that by subscribing to Shelf Life, he got the right treatment available and paid only for what was sold.
