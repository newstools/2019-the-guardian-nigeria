The seven-man committee, set up by Governor Emeka Ihedioha, headed by a former Vice Chancellor of the Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO), Prof. Jude Njoku, has rejected the newly-established universities during the twilight of the immediate past administration of Rochas Okorocha. Njoku said: â€œWe cannot afford four new universities at the same time. Can you finance them; universities that are not worth secondary schools. The new universities should be made campuses of the existing universities. He advised that the Maritime University, Osemoto, Oguta, should be converted to Maritime Institute of Technology in due course.
