 Chairman of Special Presidential Committee on Recovery of Public Funds, Okoi Obono-Obla  Though Obla confirmed that his office in Abuja was sealed on Friday by the police, he said that he was still having his job, describing the office sealing as corruption fighting back. “Some corrupt people in government are fighting me. You know they have sacked me several times without a sack letter. So, I believe that if there is anything like that, the President will inform me. I have not heard anything from him. I am not in Abuja. I traveled for the holiday and I was told of the action. I know it is the action of mischievous people.  I will not comment further until I return to Abuja,” he told The Guardian on phone yesterday. The office of the presidential panel, located in Asokoro, was sealed on Friday afternoon by some armed police officers, a source close to Aso Rock and the panel disclosed in Abuja at the weekend. The source said the police action followed a directive from the Presidency that Mr Obono-Obla should be relieved of his appointment “immediately”. The source said Obono-Obla was aware of the communication relieving him of his appointment but that he had been dodging it. So, he could use the holiday period to persuade people close to Buhari to talk to the government into rescinding its decision. “They have asked the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offenses Commission (ICPC) to start investigating corruption allegations around him,” the source said.
