Chiejine was the captain of the inaugural set of the U19 National Women’s team to the premier U19 FIFA Women’s World Cup in 2002. Prior to that feat, Chiejine had featured in the 1999 Women’s World Cup as a 16-year-old. She remains the youngest player to ever feature at the Mundial at 16 years and 34 days.  The 36-year-old also featured in the 2003 and 2007 Women’s World Cup, the 2000 and 2008 Olympic Games, and in three African Women’s Championships (1998, 2000, 2002). During her illustrious Super Falcons career, Chiejiene had 58 caps for the Super Falcons; she scored 15 goals in 61 games. “Smally”, as she is fondly called for her small frame, won many fans across Nigeria, United States, Finland, Russia and Kazakhstan where she played until her death because of her pace, athleticism and goalscoring touch.
