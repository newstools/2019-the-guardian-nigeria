The franchise announced on Tuesday via the official James Bond Twitter account: “Daniel Craig returns as James Bond, 007 in… NO TIME TO DIE. Out in the UK on 3 April 2020 and 8 April 2020 in the US. #Bond25 #NoTimeToDie”  The 25th instalment of the British spy saga will see Bond drawn out of retirement by his friend and CIA agent Felix Leiter to embark on a treacherous mission to rescue a kidnapped scientist, according to the official plot summary. Filming is already underway but has been beset by problems. An explosion at Britain’s Pinewood Studios in June rocked one of the film sets, causing damage to the stage and one minor injury. The Sun newspaper said a triple blast hit the set after a stunt went wrong, taking off part of the roof and several wall panels. Craig – who will play the legendary spy for the fifth time – earlier had to undergo minor ankle surgery after an injury on set in Jamaica. Oscar-winner Rami Malek will play a villain in the long-awaited movie, which is set to see Craig bow out after eight years as 007. “No Time To Die” will also see the return of Ralph Fiennes – as Bond’s boss – and French actress Lea Seydoux. Emmy-nominated “Fleabag” creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge has been called upon to liven up the script, at the express request of Craig, who wanted to inject more humour into the film. The production has also been repeatedly delayed over script disputes, with Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle quitting the project last year and “Beasts of No Nation” director Cary Fukunaga stepping in. The film is scheduled to premiere first in the UK on April 3 and on April 8 in the United States.
