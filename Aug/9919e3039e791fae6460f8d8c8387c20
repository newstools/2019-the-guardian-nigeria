Cardi B In a recent event, the rapper and singer, Cardi-B went off in an Instagram video over a school event in Brooklyn allegedly being halted by police. The back-to-school occasion was set to be hosted by Star Brim, a friend of the “Money” singer. Reacting to the event on Instagram, Cardi-B said, I find that s–t so f—ked up by the NYPD … it’s like this is really for the kids; Shorty was really coming out her pockets, just to help the community, and it was for kids to have a fun, positive day. The event was scheduled to be held at a school in the neighborhood of Brownsville later in August. Cardi then goes on to claim in her video that N.Y.C. police bullied the school’s principal into shutting it down. I just find that s—t so f—ked up. And f—k you and motherf—king suck a fart and suffocate on it. F—k you!, Cardi B, via Instagram. The NYPD has not yet responded to Cardi’s profanity-laced accusations over the matter.
