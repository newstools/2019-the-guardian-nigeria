 Wife of the Senate President, Toyin Saraki is the daughter of Erelu Ojuolape Ojora. She was on ground as well,to celebrate her mum.  Saraki noted that, to sustain the success, the country must continue mass polio immunization campaigns with the same great drive and commitment as before as this is vital in ensuring that all children are protected against Polio, including the Circulating Vaccine Polio Virus (CVPDV) which can occur in areas with weak routine immunization coverage and other vaccine-preventable diseases. She recognised the significant contributions made towards the achievement of the milestone by the Bill and Melinda Gates and Aliko Dangote Foundations amongst others. Saraki reiterated that her organisationâ€™s maternal Monday social media advocacy campaign and MamaCare Frontline program were committed to supporting the immunisation work of the World Health Organisation Nigeria, the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, the Federal Ministry of Health, and the National Centre for Disease Control.
