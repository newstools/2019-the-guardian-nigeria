The Federal High Court in Lagos Thursday discharged and acquitted a former Senior Special Adviser on domestic affairs to former Nigeriaâ€™s President Goodluck Jonathan Waripamo-Owei Dudafa, and a banker, Joseph Iwuejo Dudafa and Iwuejo were charged by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on a 23-count charge bordering on conspiracy, money laundering and concealment of proceeds of crime on June 11, 2013 Although Judge Mohammed Idris initially dismissed the defendants no-case submission in August 2018, he, however, said it is difficult to convict Dudafa and Iwuejo because the antigraft Commission failed to prove the charges against them beyond reasonable doubts. He said EFCC failed to call significant witnesses, including Jonathan, one Somprei Omeibi, the Central Bank of Nigeria Governor and former National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki, who were linked to the proving of the case. Idris said the failure of the witnesses to testify in the case was fatal to the prosecution. He said the case was built on suspicion which is not substantial enough for prosecution. He, therefore, dismissed the entire 22 counts against the defendants, discharged and acquitted them.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
