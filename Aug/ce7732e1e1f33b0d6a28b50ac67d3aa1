 Nigerian American Chamber of Commerce (NACC)  “There is a need for state governments to implement integrity audit of all these old and aged structures within the location where a previous collapse has been recorded,” he averred.
   
The acting General Manager, Lagos State Government Building Control Agency (LABSCA), Olabodurin Oki, said most of the drawings for construction in Lagos, are drawn by quacks, calling on the State Government to increase the number of enforcement teams in a bid to cover the state more effectively.He noted that developers are making regulations difficult in the State, adding that after getting approvals for a particular building, they set up structures they did not get approval for. “They have two types of approval. One for approval and the other for construction, and most times they change the use of the building at their will without any form of appraisal or consultation,” he said.
  
The Group Managing Director, Adron Homes and Properties Limited, Dr Adetola Emmanuelking, said the government has yet to come to terms that housing is critical to the national economy.He added that most of the structures in the country were built without building plan approval; hence, the need for re-certification of building plan approval is vital. Meanwhile, the Vice President, NACC, Ehi Braimah, said the rate of building collapse in the country has become so disturbing that various accusations and counter-accusations are now the order of the day.He said in most cases, the government as a key stakeholder, accuses professionals in the building industry of engaging in sharp practices. In his words, “And on the other hand, critics have constantly accused the government and its officials of corruption and negligence, because most of the funds for monitoring and evaluation are either misappropriated or diverted to personal pockets leading to structural failures.” He added that the incidence of building collapse has become a recurring decimal in many parts of the country, which has raised much concern and anxiety about the safety of lives and property.He pointed out that the predominant rate of building collapse in Nigeria poses a grave concern and challenges to all the stakeholders in the building construction industry including professional bodies and associations, building consultants, governments, developers, landowners and building users.
