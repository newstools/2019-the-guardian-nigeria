The President said the ongoing reform of the Police would include recruitment of more hands, cultivation of stronger local intelligence and networking with communities, traditional rulers and adequate training. President Buhari noted that the return of the Ministry of Police Affairs was aimed at driving the new initiative of ensuring proper provision of security for lives and property, with proactive intelligence gathering to nip crimes in the bud before they escalate. “I have decided to meet with Your Highnesses to assure you that the government is determined to tackle and deal decisively with all security challenges facing us as a nation. “This consultation, therefore, is to engage you, our royal fathers, so that, collectively, we can arrive at solutions to any and all security problems in the country. “We must all play our part to finally address these security challenges, particularly traditional rulers, in your respective communities, where you feel the pulse of the people, being the closest to the populace at the grassroots level,” he said. The President, according to a statement signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, yesterday, urged the traditional rulers to provide more support to security agencies with their versatile knowledge of communities and individuals. “These policies and programmes include a robust revamping of police intelligence gathering capacity and the significant boosting of the numbers of security personnel in our local communities. This in specific terms will include recruiting more police officers and doing so whenever possible from their local government areas, where they would then be stationed in the best traditions of policing worldwide. “Working with the state governments also, we intend to improve the equipping of the police force with advanced technology and equipment that can facilitate their work. To drive this, I recently created a full-fledged Ministry of Police Affairs. “As I said during my meeting with the Traditional Rulers from the South-West, directives have been issued to the appropriate federal authorities to speedily approve licensing for states requesting the use of drones to monitor forests and other criminal hideouts,” he added. The President said CCTVs would be installed on highways and other strategic locations so that activities in some hidden places can be exposed, more effectively monitored and open to actionable interventions. In his remark, the Sultan of Sokoto assured the President of the full support of traditional rulers in the country. “We have come to assure you of our total support, total commitment and undiluted dedication to moving the nation forward as one of the best countries of the world,” the royal father noted. He said the traditional thrones in various communities predated the amalgamation of the protectorates, stating that all the forefathers had always upheld the virtues of peace, unity, and stability. The Sultan assured the President that royal fathers across the country had been in constant communication on the security challenges, promising to support the government to succeed. He commended Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara for the relative peace in the state after he was sworn into office, urging other governors to adopt same model. He also called on the President to strengthen the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) for more effective monitoring of drug-related situations in the country for correction and prosecutions.
