Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has said that there is no tariff increase in electricity approved by the Commission. The General Manager, Public Affairs Department Dr. Usman Abba Arabi, disclosed this, yesterday, in Abuja. He stated that the regulator would in the discharge of its statutory responsibilities enshrined under the Electric Power Sector Reform (EPSR) Act, continue to undertake periodic reviews of electricity tariffs in accordance with prevailing methodology. NERC in its Minor Review of Multi-Year Tariff Order 2015 and Minimum Remittance Order for the Year 2019, published on Thursday, indicated that from 2020, electricity consumers would pay additional N8 and N14 for every kilowatt-hour of energy depending on the distribution companies. Arabi said: “In all instances of such reviews and rulemaking, the Commission shall widely consult stakeholders and final decision shall take due regard of all contributions.” Reacting to reports of the tariff hike, the GM Public Affairs said the minor review implemented by the Commission was a retrospective adjustment of the tariff regime released in 2015 to account for changes in macroeconomic indices for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018, thereby providing certainty about revenue shortfall that may have arisen due to the differential between tariffs approved by the regulator and actual end-user tariffs. Meanwhile, stakeholders had expressed dissatisfaction over any increase in electricity charges. The development followed the introduction of a meter policy, which passed the responsibility of meter procurement and installation to electricity users, especially in the face of the poor power supply, practices of estimated billing, weak remittance of collected tariff by the utilities companies among other issues in the country.
