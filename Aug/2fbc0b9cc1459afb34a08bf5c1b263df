Managing Director of the Imo State Oil Producing Areas Development Commission (ISOPADEC), Engr. Anthony Okwuosha has refuted rumours that the commission would sack workers and slash employees’ salaries. He also said there was no directive from Deputy Governor of the state, Gerald Irona, to carry such directive mandating him to reduce the wage bill to manageable capacity. The state government made the clarification in a statement issued by Special Assistant to the MD on Media and Communications, Collins Ughalaa, insisting that such a report was false. “The report is fabricated and entirely the imagination of its purveyors and authors of the story”. “The Managing Director and members of ISOPADEC board have not received any recommendation or instructions from any quarters to either sack workers or reduce their salaries for whatever reason,” the statement added.
