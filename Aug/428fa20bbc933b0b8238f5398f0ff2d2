Residents of FESTAC Town in Lagos are beginning to heave a sigh of relief with the reopening of some major roads, which were for several weeks closed for repairs. Since early July, when rehabilitation of the major roads began, major roads in and out of FESTAC were closed as motorists and pedestrians had to use alternative routes. The road diversion expectedly resulted traffic gridlock and congestion as people hassle each other over right of way to get ahead. Some residents have also praised the chairman of Amuwo Odofin local government area, Vincent Buraimoh for the rehabilitation. It would be recalled that the area had been infamous for the parlous state of roads in the once federal estate. According to a resident, Chris Nwasike, last year, there were 744 potholes on nine major roads in Festac. “Yes, we counted. Meaning that you can’t drive 200m in Festac without slowing to near stop, hold your breath and navigate through potholes that are better described as gullies.” Another residents said: “Today, however, it is a huge relief that a few of the critical roads are receiving attention. Movement in, out and within Festac is now easy as the major routes are now accessible to residents.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
