 UNILAG  The Executive Director of ULBS, Prof. Abraham Osinubi, in his address during an interactive session with ULBS participants at the institution’s Arthur Mbanefo Digital Resources Centre, recently, said ULBS would bridge the gap between theory and practise, in order to bridge the gulf between what students are being taught and what is obtainable in the field. Osinubi said: “ULBS will advance the culture of business leadership, management and other related fields. The school will collaborate with experts, industries to give the students the leadership skills, experience and networking opportunities they need to succeed in business. The payment is flexible. Over 50 students have applied but we are going to shortlist to 25.” He added that ULBS was creating a world-class environment in order to breed excellent students. “Environment is key to knowledge and we have provided standard facilities for our students,” he said.
