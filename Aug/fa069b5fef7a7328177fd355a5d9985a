The Command Public Relation Officers DSP Yakubu Sabo said in a press statement issued on Friday in Kaduna.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that drivers of articulated vehicles had blocked the Abuja-Kaduna highway for six hours in protest over the killing. The bus driver was on his way to Abuja from Katsina when a policeman allegedly shot him dead at about 5am while the motor boy was haggling with another policeman who demanded for a N1000 bribe. The suspect was said to have run into the bush after the shooting while the other policeman quickly disappeared from the scene using a police vehicle.
