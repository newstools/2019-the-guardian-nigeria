A motorcyclist, Chimaobi Nwogu, was yesterday shot dead at a military checkpoint in Ohanze Isiahia town, Obingwa Local Government Area, near Aba in Abia State. The deceased has reportedly refused to part with N100 at the checkpoint. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Geoffrey Ogbonna, who is based at Umuahia, the state capital, however told The Guardian on the telephone at about 7:45p.m. that he was yet to get such report. According to eyewitnesses, the deceased’s move to ride past the military checkpoint without dropping N100 provoked one of the soldiers into getting on another motorcycle and pursuing Nwogu to Umuokereke Ngwavillage, where he shot him dead. “We saw a soldier pursuing Chimaobi. We wondered what happened when the soldier shot him and when Nwogu fell from his motorcycle, the soldier jumped back on the motorcycle that brought him and fled.” Describing Nwogu’s sudden death as pathetic, leaving behind three children and a pregnant wife due for delivery, the eyewitness added that the incident situation caused panic while irate youths of the community carried Nwogu’s body to Ohanze among other places and set the checkpoint on fire. The soldiers watched without fighting back.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
