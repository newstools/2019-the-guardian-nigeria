   Delivering his sermon titled: “Testing Time,” Jimoh noted that trusting and depending on God, especially now that the nation is passing through many challenges, would make God protect them the way He protected Job’s life, such that the devil could not touch his life during his trying moments. He reminded them that Job was a man after God’s heart because of his good works and trust in Him. Charging the congregation to take care of their children and also pray for them, as Job did for his children, the cleric stressed that such would bring blessing upon them and their children. He praised members’ efforts in meeting the requirements that enabled organisation of their church and prayed God to grant them the grace to live and work according to His will. The Treasurer of Lagos Mainland Conference, Elder Adeyemi Adedokun also implored church members to always look unto Jesus alone, as He would not let them down. Addressing the newly elected Elders and Deacons, the Evangelism and Sabbath School Director of Lagos Mainland Conference, Pastor Aduranire Sofowora urged them to be of good behaviour, both inside and outside the church. He said they must show good leadership qualities at all times and urged their wives to always support them. The Executive Secretary of Lagos Mainland Conference charged the members to seriously study their Bible to know more about what it says about the Sabbath, the state of the dead and the second coming of Christ, among others.
