Mazi Nnamdi Kanu Chairman of Imo State Council of Traditional Rulers, HRM Samuel Ohiri (Eze Imo), has admonished the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, to tread with caution in his agitation. The monarch gave the advice yesterday in Owerri while reacting to the recent attack on former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, by members of IPOB in Nuremberg, Germany. He said the action of Kanu’s men ran contrary to Igbo customs and tradition, adding that “no reasonable Igbo son would insult or assault his leader or elder.” Ohiri contended that “Ekweremadu does not pose any threat to the Igbo cause and does not deserve the embarrassment and humiliation he received from Kanu’s men in Germany.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
