The Peoples’ Republic of China will in November welcome the first set of Nigerian tourists visiting the country through the Tour2China window. The programme is courtesy of the Chinese government’s new group visa policy for cross-cultural and trade exchanges between the two countries. Managing Director of 1860 Travels, the local partner of Bravo International, Francis Daodu, told The Guardian that the first set of Nigerian tourists are due to arrive in China on November 23, 24 and 25, following the successful applications. The groups, Daodu said, would be visiting five major cities – Beijing, Shanghai, Yihu, Guangzhou and Suzhou – exploring the best of the East Asian and the world’s most populous country. The new visa policy of not less than five persons per group allows visiting Nigerians to combine tourism and business in China. Daodu said the itinerary already has everything each traveler would need, though with a lot of flexibility to accommodate special groups and needs for the pleasure of tourists. “It is a group plan for all to explore Asia. In the last three weeks, a lot of people have reached us; willing to travel to China. This is an exchange between cultures. We are expecting both outbound and inbound. We are starting now, and the Chinese will start coming by 2020,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
