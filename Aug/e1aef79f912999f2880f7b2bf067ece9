Project Manager TELA, African Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF), Sylvester Oikeh, has said biotechnologically produced crops have contributed to global food security, sustainability and climate change.
 
Dr Oikeh disclosed that in Ibadan at the 32nd annual international conference of Biotechnology Society of Nigeria (BSN).Oikeh lauded the country for being the first in Africa to approve indigenous biotech crop, BT cowpea, adding that it showed that Nigeria’s environment was conducive for biotechnology.
 
He, however, urged the government to support Water Efficient Maize Product which seeks to boost maize yield and address stem borer and fall armyworms which are the two major pests affecting maize production in Nigeria.
 
“Biotechnology maize should be a key component of the integrated pest management for controlling stem borer and fall armyworm in maize production in Nigeria and other African countries.
 
“We need the support of the government to get the technology to the farmers. The government should support the technology as much as possible. We cannot run away from Genetically Modified Technology (GMT); it is a tool to facilitate development of new crop varieties and new animal varieties,” he explained.
