The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) yesterday disclosed that it has received documents on the FIFA investigation and subsequent life ban of former Super Eagles coach, Samson Siasia. FIFA Ethics Committee on Friday announced that it had placed a life ban from all football-related activities on Siasia.
 
In a statement yesterday, NFF’s Acting President, Seyi Akinwunmi disclosed that the federation had already reached out to the former U-20, U-23 and Super Eagles head coach and was aware that he was receiving appropriate legal advice.“The NFF was shocked to learn of the investigation and subsequent decision by the FIFA Ethics Committee (Adjudicatory Chamber) placing a life ban on Mr. Samson Siasia. But we have however now received documents, including one known as the Motivated Decision, and we have handed them to our lawyers to study and provide legal advice to the Federation.
 
“It is a massive sanction on one of our legends. Siasia is a fooball legend but most importantly he is a Nigerian. We must therefore be interested in the matter and be properly advised.”
 
Akinwunmi added: “Siasia gave his all for Nigeria, playing for the U20 team right from his secondary school days and then for the senior team for several years, and also coaching the U20 and U23 teams and the Super Eagles. While we respect the FIFA processes and appreciate that an investigation was conducted prior to the decision, the least we as a Federation can do is empathise with him at this time, make ourselves available to him and hope that in some way he is able to clear his name as he has promised to do.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
