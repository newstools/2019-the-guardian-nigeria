 Big Brother Naija housemate Esther  This week’s challenge was a test of vocabulary. Trust Biggie, in five minutes, the housemates were required to spell as many words as possible and the one with the most correctly spelled words became the Head of House. Did someone say it was easy? Well, as easy as it sounded, there were strict instructions for them to follow. Housemates were only allowed to pick a single tile on each trip and if anyone was caught cheating, the housemate was disqualified. Venita, Diane, Mike, and Tacha fell victim to this rule and they were disqualified by Biggie. Mercy also got her last word invalidated as she spelt it after the buzzer went off. In addition to Biggie’s rules, the housemates were to avoid spelling proper nouns and repeating a word. With entering into the second round, Seyi, Khafi, Frodd, Elozonam, Ike, and Esther made it to the round of the game after spelling seven words correctly. As Head of House, the 22-year-old Lagos-based lawyer enjoys immunity for the week, 250 Bet9ja coins and the Head of House Bedroom privilege. Her team, Cruisetopia also got a reward of 20 Bet9ja bonus coins. When asked who she would share the Head of House bedroom with, Esther picked Frodd as her roommate. This win is sure an early birthday present for Esther as her birthday comes up tomorrow. Trust Biggie’s Ninjas to come through with task aids for the Pepper Dem gang. For the challenge, teaspoons were provided for the purpose of transporting the water. Elozonam was given 20 seconds to save a nominated housemate and replace it with another. Using this special power, Elozonam saved Venita and replaced her with Frodd. Recall the Cruisetopia team last week won the nomination challenge. Will these change things in the Pepper Dem House or will they buckle up and aim for many wins this week?  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
