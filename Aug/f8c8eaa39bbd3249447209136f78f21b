Photo: PIXABAY  He netted after one, six and eight minutes of the first half as AshantiGold cruised to a 3-0 victory over Akonangui of Equatorial Guinea to finish 4-1 aggregate winners of the preliminary tie. The record for the fastest CAF club competition hat-trick is five minutes set by Zambian Lazarous Kambole two seasons ago playing for Zesco United in a Champions League group match. Buildcon of Zambia were surprise casualties despite forcing a 1-1 draw away to Young Buffaloes in eSwatini. Trailing 1-0 from the first leg, Buildcon made a dream start with David Nshirikimana giving them the lead less than one minute into the opening half. But Buffaloes recovered to equalise on 53 minutes through Siboniso Ngwenya and overall victory earned them a shot at Bidvest Wits from neighbouring South Africa during September. Ghanaian Richard Djodi bagged a brace for Tanzanian ice cream company club Azam as they defeated Fasil Kenema of Ethiopia 3-1 to overturn a 1-0 first leg loss. Zimbabwean Obrey Chirwa was the other Azam scorer and he will face a club from his homeland, Triangle United, in a last-32 tie.
