A$AP Rocky is once again a free man, pending the verdict of his ongoing assault case in Sweden. The highly-publicised trial wrapped Friday with Swedish prosecutors asking the court to convict the 30-year-old American rapper and consider imposing at least a six-month jail sentence. Upon his release, one of the first things the rapper did after he was released was to write an Instagram post thanking his supporters.   THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART TO ALL OF MY FANS, FRIENDS AND ANYONE ACROSS THE GLOBE WHO SUPPORTED ME DURING THESE LAST FEW WEEKS I CANT BEGIN TO DESCRIBE HOW GRATEFUL I AM FOR ALL OF YOU THIS HAS BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT AND HUMBLING EXPERIENCE I WANT TO THANK THE COURT FOR ALLOWING ME BLADI AND THOTO TO RETURN TO OUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS THANKS AGAIN FOR ALL OF THE LOVE AND SUPPORT A post shared by  PRETTY FLACKO (@asaprocky) on Aug 2, 2019 at 11:39am PDT   However, the rapper’s lawyer said in closing remarks that nothing was premeditated or coordinated about the confrontation. He also referred to footage showing A$AP Rocky standing on the alleged victim’s arm and said it wasn’t the same as kicking. A$AP Rocky and two members of his entourage have been in custody in Stockholm since July 3. They pleaded not guilty earlier this week to assault charges.  The case, which has attracted worldwide attention and support for A$AP Rocky from many celebrities such as Kim Kardashian West and Jada Pinkett Smith, also received an extraordinary intervention from Donald Trump, who sent the top U.S. official in charge of hostage affairs to attend the trial in Stockholm. However, A$AP Rocky’s freedom was also extended to the two other suspects involved, until a verdict is expected in the assault case on August 14.
