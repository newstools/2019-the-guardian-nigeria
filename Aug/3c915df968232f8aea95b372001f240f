   Google previously named its updates after cupcake, donut, eclair, gingerbread, honeycomb and ice cream sandwich. Other updates were named after jellybean, KitKat, lollipop, marshmallow, nougat, oreo and pie. “Our engineering team has always used internal code names for each version, based off of tasty treats, or desserts, in alphabetical order,” Google said in a blog post. “This naming tradition has become a fun part of the release each year externally, too. “ Google said it decided on changing to Android codename because the names weren’t always understood by everyone in the global community. It said its commitments to billion of Android users entails using names that “are clear and relatable for everyone in the world.” “So, this next release of Android will simply use the version number and be called Android 10,” Google said. “We think this change helps make release names simpler and more intuitive for our global community. And while there were many tempting ‘Q’ desserts out there, we think that at version 10 and 2.5 billion active devices, it was time to make this change.” The new update, due to start arriving on smartphones in the coming weeks, will also come with a more modern logo, which Google said was inspired by the most recognisable non-human member of the community, the Android robot.
