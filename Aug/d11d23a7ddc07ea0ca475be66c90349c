 Barcelona’s goalkeeper Neto blocks a shot on goal during the International Champions Cup football match between FC Barcelona and SSC Napoli at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, Florida. RHONA WISE / AFP  “Goalkeeper Neto is to undergo surgery this Tuesday on a  fractured scaphoid bone in his left hand sustained in training while on the US tour,” a club statement read. “Doctor Xavier Mir will perform the operation in the presence of the Club Medical Services. Afterward, he will make a statement to explain how the surgery has gone and to offer an approximate recovery date.” Neto joined Barcelona this summer from Valencia, with fellow goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen leaving Camp Nou and going the other way. Coach Ernesto Valverde is already likely to be without Lionel Messi against Bilbao. Messi missed the friendly win over Napoli on Saturday after sustaining a calf tear in training last week.
