The management of Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) has debunked the message circulating on social media that it has opened for an internship at a N5,000 application fees and N1,800 parcel levy. Chief Medical Director, LASUTH, Prof. Adetokunbo O. Fabamwo, said the programme did not originate from LASUTH and the general public should be informed that the management of LASUTH frowns at this fallacious information meant to defraud innocent people. The fraudster had put out a notice calling for application for internship opportunities, listing the available positions to include House Officers (MBBS/BDS), Intern Pharmacists, Intern Radiographers, among others. The person claimed the interested candidates must possess a recognised degree or equivalent in their areas of specialisation from a reputable university in Nigeria or abroad.
