 Public school  The lecturer, Dr. Jacob Adeyanju of the Department of Educational Administration, University of Lagos (UNILAG), made the call at the official launch and maiden edition of the Julienne school support foundation in Ogun State. Adeyanju, while speaking at the event, themed: “Teach for change: Teachers, the change-makers,” stressed that the responsibility of funding public education cannot be left for the government alone, hence all hands must be on deck to achieve the desired change. He suggested that government could bring this idea on board through policy formulation and planning that would accommodate the entire process and shape involved in the interest of the Nigerian child. “If you allow companies to adopt schools and make them come to the government’s rescue, the image of the schools will be lifted. If you say that you are not bothered about what goes on in the public schools, their products will become your staff tomorrow, and when they are not good enough, it affects their input in any organisation they find themselves.” Founder and convener of the programme, Mrs. Modupe Ogundimu, said the conference was to create awareness for many teachers on what has changed in their careers. She added that no teacher should be left behind in the changes that came with the 21st century. She said the event was to keep teachers abreast of current trends and how to incorporate them in educational deliveries, know the available tools, as well as what the changing roles meant to them. On the role of information technology in teaching for change, Ogundimu noted that teachers have to be globally relevant with technology, adding, “A teacher cannot be IT relevant without the knowledge of computer.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
