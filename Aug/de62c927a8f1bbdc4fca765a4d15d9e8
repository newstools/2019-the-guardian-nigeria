Bayern coach Niko Kovac made 10 changes at half-time, with New Zealand international Sarpreet Singh among the newcomers. The 20-year-old talent, who arrived from Wellington Phoenix earlier this year, scored twice before the hour mark to pick up his first goals in a Bayern shirt. Bayern’s record signing Lucas Hernandez also came on at half-time to make his first appearance for the club. The French World Cup winner joined Bayern for 80 million euros earlier this year but has been out of action since February due to a knee injury. “It felt good. I am making progress slowly. I feel close to 100 percent,” Hernandez told Bild. “I will need to work up the rest by playing matches. I hope I can be fit enough to play on Monday.” On Monday, Bayern starts the defense of their German Cup title by facing Energie Cottbus.
