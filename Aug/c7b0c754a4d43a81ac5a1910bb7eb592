Some students of Adeseun Ogundoyin Polytechnic, Eruwa, Oyo State yesterday protested against non-accreditation of their courses even when they had completed their Higher National Diploma (HND). They, however, condemned the school authorities’ explanation that they made mistake in offering them admission to study the affected courses in civil engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, office technology management, library and information science and purchasing and supply. The students, numbering over 1,000, alleged that instead of the Oyo State Government and the institution to invest in their future, they have succeeded in taking them backward and that the action was a deliberate ploy to deny them their future as years spent on campus had ended in waste. However, the Public Relations Officer of the institution, Mr. Gbenga Olayiwola, said the state government had taken over the matter, saying: “The state government has set up a panel of inquiry to look into the matter and their findings would be made known soon.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
