Organisers of the forthcoming Lagos State maiden multi-sport holiday training session for children tagged, ‘Lagos Sports Summer Camp,’ will kick off at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Surulere, Lagos on Saturday. According to the organisers, the camp is for children between age nine and 16, who would be trained in various sports activities. The Director General, Lagos State Sports Commission, Mr. Oluwatoyin Gafaar said the Sports Summer Camp will be an avenue to train students across the five divisions of the state known as IBILE, which are Ikeja, Badagry, Ikorodu, Lagos Island and Epe. The six-day sporting event, which will end on September 5, is aimed at exposing the participants to some sports, which are athletics, table tennis, basketball, taekwondo, judo, swimming, squash and volleyball. He revealed that the idea was to introduce the chosen sports to students, who have shown interest, for them to make use of the opportunity to become future stars not only for Lagos, but also for Nigeria. After the six-day event, some identified talents will be selected for further coaching and mentoring, he said. “The camp is borne out of the need to create a conducive environment where kids come together to develop a sense of responsibility as they try new adventures away from home,” he added. According to Gafaar, the camp is not just about sports, “it is 60 per cent sports, 15 per cent art, 15 per cent academics and 10 per cent life skills.” He revealed that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has approved that the sports summer camp should be an annual event of the Lagos State Sports Commission.
