General Manager for West Africa, Azuri Technologies, Vera Nwanze, who disclosed this recently, said the initiative is in line with the Vice President’s rural electrification intervention, #“Beyond the Grid.” In addition to gaining insight into how the latest solar technology is changing lives in Nigeria, Azuri Technologies in collaboration with the Imperial College London, will inspire students in Nigeria to become the country’s future engineers. The five-day workshop, tagged, ‘Creative Futures Nigeria’ is the brainchild of Dr Sunday Popo-Ola of the Imperial College, which introduces students from all background to the potential of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), through a series of activities that test their imagination and skills. Popo-Ola said: “Creative Futures is designed to inspire pupils to achieve their full potential and encourage them to think about science and higher education. It is an interactive learning experience bringing together nine to16-year-old pupils, role models, mentors and inspirational speakers.” Nwanze said the students will have the opportunity to see and test cutting-edge solar technology that is connecting hundreds of thousands of off-grid households to the modern digital world during the workshop. She said students will take part in challenges involving construction, mechanics, and robotics in an effort to inspire them to become innovators of the future.
