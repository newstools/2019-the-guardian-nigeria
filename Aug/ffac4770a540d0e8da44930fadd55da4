After a five-year break from the music scene, Asa finally made a grand comeback in May with the stirring single, “The Beginning” for which we all hailed “The Queen is back”. Following that, she released the fantastic “Good Thing” to satisfy our need for more melodies off her upcoming project. Now, she has dropped an expectedly stunning video for the track. When she first released “Good Thing” in June, it was a subtle reminder of why she is loved by her vast fanbase. Confidently singing about her feelings following a messy breakup, the “Bibanke” crooner chants, “I am too fly for this, and I have no time for this/ I’m not afraid to be on my own and I am so fine with this” while embracing her new-found solitude. The accompanying video directed by Sesan has now given the song a more expansive meaning which further buttresses the singer’s musical brilliance. The video follows a group of people going about their day with different tribulations, ranging from a bag being stolen to a suicide attempt. In the end, each subject of the video’s day works out in the end, which gives viewers and listeners a good level of hope to cling to. Given that her recent releases didn’t fall far from expectations, we highly anticipate for her upcoming album. Press play!
