The Nigerian police has ordered the deployment of aerial surveillance helicopters to major cities in the South-West and North-West of the country. Police spokesman Frank Mba in a statement said the Inspector General of Police ordered as part of efforts aimed at curtailing crimes in the country. “While the Police Air-Wing Operational Base in Abuja caters for Abuja—Kaduna highway as well as the adjoining States in the North-West and North-Central, the new base in Ondo State will cater to the adjoining states and highways straddling the South-West,” Mba said. There’s growing concern over the level of banditry and kidnapping in the country. As at April 2019, The Nigeria Security Tracker, produced by the Washington-based Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), that monitors levels of violence by collating local media reports indicated that from the beginning of 2019, there have been 262 civilian deaths as a result of banditry and kidnapping. In the whole of 2018 there were 288 and for 2017, the figure is 52. The police noted that the “aerial surveillance is geared towards improving the security of lives and property in the affected areas.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
