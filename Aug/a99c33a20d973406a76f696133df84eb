Nigeria Stock Exchange, Lagos Negative sentiments continued to pervade activities on the equity sector of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) as the All-Share Index (ASI) and market capitalisation depreciated by 1.4 per cent to close the week at 26,925.29 points and N13.121 trillion respectively. Similarly, all other indices finished lower with the exception of NSE Premium Index, which appreciated by 0.64 per cent. Analysts have argued that factors such as political developments are reasons most foreign investors exit the Nigerian equities market. However, rather than panic, they have urged investors to take advantage of the bear market, noting that the market has nosedived so much over the past few months and the bearish days would soon be over. Specifically, analysts at Investdata Consulting Limited said with stock prices bottoming out, the market presents good buying opportunities, while the low prices provide investment opportunities for players in the market, with focus on the fundamentally justified stocks. “We expect the mixed performance to continue as selloff persists in the absence of positive news and economic stimulus, despite the mixed economic indices and the seeming fair position corporate earnings due to prevailing low market value. “As investors continue to reshuffle their portfolios in expectation of interim earnings reports of dividend-paying companies.
Also, we see bargain hunters taking advantage of the-low prices stocks, as economic indices seemingly look positive,” they noted.
