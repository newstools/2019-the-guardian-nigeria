The Police Command in Enugu State has confirmed the killing of a Catholic Priest, Rev. Fr Paul Offu, Parish Priest of St. James Greater Parish, Ugbawka in Nkanu East Local Government Area. The Command’s Public Relations Officer, SP Ebere Amaraizu, gave the confirmation to newsmen on Friday in Enugu Amaraizu said that the command was yet to identify those who reportedly murdered the priest on Thursday evening. He pledged that the police was doing everything possible to apprehend those behind the dastardly act.

The Catholic Diocese of Enugu through its facebook link announced the killing of Offu while traveling along Ihe-Agbudu Road in Awgu Local Government Area of the state in the evening of Thursday, August 1, 2019.
