Imo State Action Alliance (AA) governorship candidate in the last general election, Uche Nwosu, is bent on a run-off election between him and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Emeka Ihedioha. Nwosu, in his petition before the tribunal, maintained that there was wrong spread of score allotted to Ihedioha in the election, adding that the PDP flagbearer did not meet the constitutional requirement to be declared winner of the poll. One of his counsel, Nelson Ezerioha, told The Guardian yesterday, that “Nwosu’s first application is that there should be a run-off between the two leading candidates, him and Ihedioha, as none of them got the spread score as required by the constitution.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
