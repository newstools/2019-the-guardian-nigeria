• Put Islam To Practice, Buhari Urges Muslims  • Leaders Must Respect Constitution — Olurode • Be True Muslims— Oloyede
• Show Love To Neighbours, Cater For Less Privileged— APC • PDP Urges Selflessness, Trust In God
• We All Have To Sacrifice For Nigeria’s Good— Atiku • Tinubu Urges Nigerians To Sacrifice For Country The escalating insecurity and austere living conditions in the country, yesterday, necessitated Islamic clerics calling on the Federal Government to renew its mandate with Nigerians and swiftly move to improve the quality of life of the governed. The admonition formed the kernel of goodwill messages given by the clerics as Muslim faithful celebrate this year’s Eid-el-Kabir. According to the Chairman of the University of Lagos (UNILAG) Muslim Community, Prof. Lai Olurode, it is important for Islamic faithful to see the occasion as a period of sober reflection, even as he reminded those in authority that they have signed a social contract with Nigerians, hence the need for them to respect the laws of the land and serve the people well. Olurode, who stressed that the country’s problems were not only that of the leadership, but also of the followers, reminded the leaders that the welfare of Nigerians must at all times be paramount to them. “We also need to remind them that part of the Constitution, which they pledged to uphold says that the welfare of the people and their security shall be the primary purpose of government. But are they in obedience to the words of the constitution? If they are not, then they cannot be said to be in obedience to the words of their creators, which the festival Ileya Eid-el-Kabir represents. So, it is time for them to renew their mandate with the people of Nigeria so that they will be able to account very well before their creator. “My appeal to the leaders is for them to use this Sallah to reflect on what they are doing; whether they are doing it right or wrong. They can on their own seek forgiveness from Allah and He will forgive them… Fighting corruption in this country is a serious challenge because we are not respecting the laws of God. Prophet Ibrahim respected the laws of his God by offering his only son, Ismail and leaders and followers should also respect the laws of the land as Prophet Ibrahim did.” The Executive Secretary/CEO, Muslim Ummah of Southwest Nigeria (MUSWEN), Prof. Dawud Noibi, in his message urged Muslims not to allow their love for material things derail them on the path of rectitude and their love for God. He called on Muslim faithful to emulate Prophet Ibrahim, who surrendered his will to Almighty God by offering his only son to God. He asked rhetorically: “Are we prepared to give up worldly desires that people are running after, even doing so sometimes sinfully and in a criminal way? We need to do all within our powers to fulfill God’s will, so that we will be rewarded both in this world and hereafter.” In his goodwill message, the Secretary General of the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA), Prof. Ishaq Oloyede specifically tasked genuine Muslims to “contribute to peace in the society, and be part of the solution rather than be part of the problem.” On his part, the Chief Imam of Ar.Rahmat Islamiyyah Society of Nigeria, Ikeja, Sheikh Ishaq Adebayo Tejidini advised Nigerians to be patient with government, as what was destroyed over the years cannot be repaired overnight. He, however, expressed confidence that Nigeria would overcome its current travails if everyone was prayerful and lead a righteous life. While urging Muslims to abide by laws guiding the Ileya festival, he also enjoined Muslims, especially those in authority to fulfill promises made during the election period. He added: “You should emulate Prophet Ibrahim, who made promise to Almighty Allah and he fulfilled his obligation because of that, Almighty Allah did not allow him to slaughter his only son, but replaced him with a ram, and that is why Muslims are slaughtering ram today. So, every Muslim should have this at the back of their minds that the celebration is not for fun. They should not do it their own way, but the way Allah prescribed that it should be done. And so any body who wants Allah to be pleased with him should follow the laws that guide the Ileya festival.” The Chief Missioner of Nasrullhai-l Fatih Society (NASFAT), Imam Abdul-Azeez Morufu Onike, called on Nigerians to seize the opportunity of the day to seek God’s intervention and pray for the country, the government and her Citizens. Onike urged Nigerians to trust in God and support the government of the day in its effort to better the country, even as he enjoined Muslims to note that Islamic rituals, one of which is Eid-ul Adha are not aimless in purpose, but rather avenues to evoke emotions in the hearts of believers. According to the Chief Imam, University Of Lagos, Dr. Ismail Musa “We face difficulties today as individuals and as a nation largely because of our intransigence and non-recognition of the superiority of divine wisdom. It is instructive to note that when Ibrahim informed Ismail that Allah has commanded him to slaughter him, the latter responded: “Do as you are commanded” (Quran 37: 10).”He said majority of Nigerians today are not prepared to hearken to the commandments of God hence the numerous problems that bedevil the country without potentialities of lasting solutions. MEANWHILE, President Muhammadu Buhari has said the greatest commitment to Islam is for Muslims to put its good virtues into practice, and by making justice and righteousness the guiding principle of their everyday life. 
 
In his sallah message to Muslims, Buhari tasked them to lead exemplary lives, saying, “we should be the mirror through which others see the good virtues of our faith.’’“Islam is a religion of peace and we should avoid violent extremist ideas that give Islam a wrong name because our conduct leaves more lasting positive impressions than what we say by word of mouth.’’ The President regretted that “violent extremism is the greatest challenge facing Islam today and the only way we can neutralise its evil influence is to distance ourselves from the activities and teachings of those who preach indiscriminate violence against innocent people. And this flies in the face of the teachings of Islam.’’
 
The President in a statement signed by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, advised parents to “protect their children from the deadly exposure to violent extremists, who manipulate and exploit those children for their own evil agenda.’’ The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, enjoined Nigerians to imbibe the lessons of the important Islamic festival, which exemplifies sacrifice and fulfillment of promise as demonstrated by Prophet Ibrahim (RTA). It noted: “As we celebrate the Sallah feast with family, friends and loved ones, Muslim faithful and indeed all Nigerians are implored to show love to neighbours and cater for the less privileged around us. “In our national life, Eid ul-Adha is a reminder for us to make our individual and collective sacrifices for the well-being, unity, peace and development of our dear country, Nigeria. “We must therefore shun the disruptive and divisive utterances and actions emanating from some unpatriotic quarters lately. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in its goodwill message urged Nigerians to use this year’s Eid el Kabir to imbibe the life of total trust in the Almighty God in all spheres of life.In a statement released by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Olobondiyan, the PDP noted that, “the Eid el Kabir indeed offers us great lessons on selflessness and absolute trust in God, as exemplified in the life of Prophet Ibrahim.” The party called on all compatriots to use the occasion to particularly pray for the nation, reach out and share with the less privileged, the deprived as well as victims of escalated insecurity in various parts of our country in the recent time. The PDP also urged “prayers and support for our gallant troops, who are making sacrifices and putting their lives daily on the line in protecting our nation, while also praying for the unity, peace, stability and development of our dear nation…” WAZIRI Adamawa and presidential candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar, in his message said; “during Eid al-Adha, we honour the submission of the patriarch, Prophet Ibrahim to the wish of Almighty Allah to sacrifice his son. This feast is, therefore, a reminder for all of us to make sacrifices for the betterment of humanity.”He said, “there are happenings across the globe that tell us that the world is in dire need of love and peace. Our dear fatherland, Nigeria is currently at a crossroads. Tensions strew our nation and never have we been in dire need of love for our neighbour as today. Thus, my message to the nation as we celebrate Eid al-Adha is that we all have to sacrifice for the good of Nigeria. “Everybody cannot sacrifice everything for Nigeria, but everyone can sacrifice something for her to move forward from the place of anger, bitterness, distrust and disunity. “I urge all Nigerians of faith to remember that God made us all Nigerians for a purpose. If He wanted to, God could have made us into many distinct nations. But in His wisdom, He made us all into one corporate, indivisible country. We must accept that we are not wiser than our Creator. Therefore, let us perish every thought of dividing Nigeria and focus our energies on reviving our fatherland,” Atiku wrote. National Leader of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, yesterday urged Muslims and all Nigerians to make more sacrifice for the country. He said: ““Like Prophet Ibrahim, let us be ready to make sacrifices for the well being of Nigerians and development of the country… May the joy of Eid ul-Adha be multiplied many folds in our lives and the life of our great nation. May the blessings of Almighty Allah be with us all forever.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
