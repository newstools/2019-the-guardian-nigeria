Singer, songwriter, and upcoming producer, Tems, is back with a banging new single, ‘Try Me’. The talented singer, popular for her earlier singles ‘Mr Rebel’, ‘Looku Looku’ and ‘Fallin’ – a collab with rapper Ladipoe, takes us on an emotional journey with her deep and soulful voice. Tems’ passionate, powerful, yet soothing vocals, gives listeners a peek into her mind. She allows listeners to tap into her frustration, and takes them on a journey through her process of overcoming her challenges, and reclaiming her power. Accompanied by the sound of strings and a light bass in the background, the Isale Eko native sings about being held back from truly growing, moving forward, and shining on her own terms. Tems announced the track via Instagram with a caption that read;
“Thank you all so much for waiting!TRY ME is finally OUT on all platforms
For the oppressed, this is a breakout song.
For the Underrated, understated people who have been suppressed from use and abuse. .
