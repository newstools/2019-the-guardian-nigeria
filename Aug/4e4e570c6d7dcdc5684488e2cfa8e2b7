 (FILES) In this file photo taken on August 17, 2019 Paris Saint-Germain’s Brazilian forward Neymar takes part in a training session in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, west of Paris, on the eve of the French L1 football match between Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) and Rennes. – Paris Saint-Germain coach Thomas Tuchel said Neymar is “ready” for the upcoming Ligue 1 game but whether he plays depends on developments in the Brazilian’s bid to leave the club. (Photo by FRANCK FIFE / AFP)  Neymar was declared fit to play for the first time since injuring his ankle in May by PSG coach Thomas Tuchel on the eve of Toulouse’s visit to the Parc des Princes. But the club’s Qatari owners and sporting director Leonardo have sidelined him as the uncertainty over his future continues to dominate their early-season landscape. In the squad list published ahead of the 1900 GMT kick-off, Neymar was marked down as “absent”. The 27-year-old wants a return to Spain, to his former club Barca who sold him to the French champions for a world record 222 million euros ($264 million at the time) in 2017. Or to Real Madrid, who reportedly had a 100 million euros bid plus players rejected this week. The European transfer window closes next Saturday. Whether Neymar figures in PSG’s fourth league outing the day before at Metz could be up to the negotiators. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
