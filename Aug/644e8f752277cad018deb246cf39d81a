 Past Dabira women’s conference  Since the inception of the annual conference, there has always been a unique twist to each edition. Besides the fact that the Dabira team and their creative/planning skills are top notches, they are able to connect with their audience in a way that cannot be explained, which is quite fascinating. The theme of this year’s conference is Bruised But Not Broken. According to the organisers: “We all at some point in our lives, have been rubbed of something we give ourselves dearly to- a career, business, relationship with self and with others, raising good kids, improving ourselves, etc.  We have failed, been treated badly, given up, frustrated, messed up…And yes, we got bruised! “The ability to stand right back up again is what keeps us unbroken. No matter how many times it comes crashing down, we find the strength to start over and over again.” Speaking at this year’s impactful and life-changing event are Elyshia Brooks, Branding Expert from the USA; Mary Akpobome, COO, HBCL Investments; Banke Sotomi, Behavioural Change Expert and Lara Odebiyi, Convener, Dabira Conference. The conference holds on October 12 at the Admiralty Conference Center, Naval Dockyard, Ahmadu Bello Way, Victoria Island Lagos, from 10:00 am prompt.
