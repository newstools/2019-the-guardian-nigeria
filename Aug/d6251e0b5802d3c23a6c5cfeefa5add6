 Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Catherine Anene  The Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Catherine Anene, told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Makurdi that the police were still investigating the circumstances surrounding the attack and its aftermath.

There is no reason for these attacks. Several peace meetings with the communities have yielded no positive results,”  Anene said.
