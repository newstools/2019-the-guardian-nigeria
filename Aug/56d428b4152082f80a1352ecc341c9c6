Nigerian producer and Island UK/Universal Music Nigeria artist, Tekno surprised fans with a brand new single ‘Better (Hope for Africa)’. The track comes on the heels of the musician’s release of the visuals for his controversial track ‘Agege,’ and his recent production of the song ‘Won’t Be Late’ for international artists Swae Lee and Drake.
The heartfelt track is a call to action for African leaders. The artiste uses his voice to ask leaders across the continent to focus on the important social needs of the people. He mentions the lack of sufficient food, light, good roads, safety, healthcare and education to name a few, indicating that he cares about the living conditions of the masses.
