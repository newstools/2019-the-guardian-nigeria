Okoko said in Yenagoa yesterday that as two leaders who love Nigeria and the Ijaw nation, Jonathan and Dickson know the aspirant who would deploy youthful vibrancy, capacity and competence to govern the state. Reacting to questions on possible endorsement by notable leaders in the state, Okoko stressed that he had continued to consult with stakeholders, delegates and people of the state, adding that in those meetings, his ideas and plans to move the state to the next level of development were accepted by all. His words, “Everything is working to our advantage. There are some things we cannot say in public. Nobody is willing to sacrifice the interest of party for any individual. The major power-brokers are aligned with me. This is getting clearer to everybody. “Jonathan is an honourable man, one of the most honourable I have seen. He’s deeper than most people know. He might not talk the way you want him to, but once he takes a stand, you can’t push him around. He is a statesman, a father figure”. The governorship hopeful promised to continue impressing it on the delegates to look beyond sentiments and vote someone capable of turning around the fortunes of the state. “I am talking to the delegates and each of them that I met fell in love with my ideas, plans and blueprint. Some people might try to blackmail me, but it won’t work. We meet with delegates everyday, convincing them. Everybody who matters is collapsing into my structure. “I am one of the few marketable aspirants; without mincing words, I am acceptable. What that means for our young people is that this will be like a revolution for a change because the younger ones see hope through me,” he added. According to Okoko, Dickson as governor knows who fits into the current equation in the state. “Dickson is also a true patriot of the Ijaw nation, while Jonathan remains a father of Bayelsa. They will do what is right. The PDP seems to be doing things in a new order. We need to start this political revolution that our ticket can be given to a young, vibrant and intellectually-sound person like myself with a strong moral background and capacity to solve the problems of Bayelsa.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
