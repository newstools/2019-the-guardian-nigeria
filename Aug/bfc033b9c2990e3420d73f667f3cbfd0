Following earlier directives by President Buhari that all governors should decongest the prisons, the Dujima Adamawa, Alhaji Musa Halilu, has facilitated the release of 41 inmates serving various jail terms at the Numan prisons in Adamawa state. According to him, the gesture was in the spirit of Eid-Mubarak and in alignment with the Federal Government’s efforts to further decongest the nation’s prisons, and his commitment to supporting the government of Adamawa in making the state prosperous. “Besides release, those granted clemency will be rehabilitated, reintegrated and empowered with skills acquisition for six months, thereafter, will be provided with a seed grant to stay independent and become self-sufficient,” he added. Those granted clemency were between the ages of 18-25. The freed inmates, who could not conceal their joy, appreciated the traditional titleholder, who also doubles as founder of Musa Halilu Ahmed Foundation for securing their release and promised to be good ambassadors of their families and the nation.
