The Lagos State government has been advised to reconstruct some of the abandoned bridges in the state, which have been converted to use by destitute persons. Chairman of Lagos branch of Nigerian Society of Engineers, Mrs. Funmilade Akingbagbohun, made the call during a sensitisation of residents on the use of pedestrian bridges. She explained that if the abandoned facilities are reconstructed and put to use, it would impact positively on traffic congestions witnessed on major roads due to people crossing the expressway as well as save the loss of lives and man-hour.She particularly asked the government to ensure that the bridges at Obanikoro and Onipanu areas of the state are reworked for the public to enjoy free flow of movement, while ensuring the use of the facility is enforced to improve traffic management. “In the past few years, Lagos has invested in building new pedestrian bridges but so many people end up not using the bridges. They prefer crossing the highway. There is need to sensitize the public on the need to use pedestrian bridges to save lives.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
