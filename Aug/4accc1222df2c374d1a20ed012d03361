Vice President Yemi Osinbajo Thursday said the Muhammadu Buhari administration is 100 per cent in support of the bid by the country to host the 2020 FIFA U20 Women’s World Cup. Osinbajo made this declaration when a team from world football –governing body, FIFA, the Nigeria Football Federation, and members of the Bid Committee paid him a courtesy call at the Presidential Villa in Abuja. “The government of Nigeria guarantees to back the bid 100 per cent,” said Osinbajo. “We are actually excited with the prospect of hosting the FIFA U20 Women’s World Cup in 2020. “For us, football is a unifying force. Government interest in hosting is beyond commercial; football is a measure of unity and wellbeing of our people as diverse as we are.” Osinbajo, while promising that the government would do everything in its power to ensure a successful hosting in the areas of infrastructure, security and other logistics, reminded all present that President Buhari is an ardent football lover and is excited about Nigeria hosting the tournament. Earlier, NFF president, Pinnick, informed VP Osinbajo about the facilities available in the four proposed host cities – Lagos, Benin, Uyo and Asaba – adding that “hosting the FIFA U20 Women’s World Cup in 2020 will leave a lot of legacies beyond the physical; it will impact on humanity.” The FIFA team, which arrived in Nigeria on Monday evening, inspected facilities in Lagos, Benin City, Asaba and Uyo, meeting with Governors Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Godwin Obaseki, Ifeanyi Okowa and Udom Emmanuel, who variously assured them of the keen interest and desire of their various governments and peoples to meet FIFA’s requirements for hosting the competition.
