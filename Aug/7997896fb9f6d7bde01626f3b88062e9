The need for more support from organisations and employers of labour who carry out recruitment exercises for Persons With Disabilities (PWDs) have been advocated by experts.They argued that discriminatory job placements and interviews, which are not always in favour for PWDs must be totally eradicated. Acting Registrar/Chief Executive Officer, Chartered Institute of Personnel Management (CIPM), Olayiwola Oladapo, at a roundtable discussion for PWDs, said it is important to look at issues surrounding inclusiveness, which is a major challenge to the nationâ€™s economy. The forum comes in line with the Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities Act 2018, recently signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari.
Chairman, Theseabilities Foundation, Ituah Ighodalo, urged organisations to acquire the needed knowledge about PWDs, by being willing to help and create an enabling environment for them. Furthermore, the lack of readiness of organisations was seen as a setback, as many public and private buildings still need to be PWDs-compliant, as well as provide employment opportunities for them. CIPM, in conjunction with SightSavers and Theseabilities Foundation, which organised the free roundtable session on disability issues, renewed calls on organisations to put these persons into consideration when employment opportunities come.At the forum, were panellists, who addressed various issues relating to different forms of disabilities such as blindness, deafness, amputation, mental limitation, and skin colour.
