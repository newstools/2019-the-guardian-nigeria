 [FILES] Kano Pillars Football Club.  Kano Pillars narrowly defeated Ashanti Kotoko 3-2 at the Sani Abacha Stadium on Saturday and need to avoid defeat in the reverse fixture to move to the next stage of the competition. On the other hand, Kotoko needs only a 1-0 win to take the tie on the away goals rule. Pillars’ position has prompted many football pundits to write off their chances of edging the tie, but Musa will have none of that.
He believes Pillars will win again when they meet Kotoko in Kumasi on August 23. He says, “The situation might not look healthy enough going into the return leg match, but I believe the most important thing is that we are going there with a victory in the first leg match. “The return leg will be a different kettle of fish altogether. Now we have known them, how they play and all that. “When we get there, we will serve them our own dose of the game.” Pillars were guilty of wasting their chances and also allowing the Ghanaians to hit them from disadvantaged positions twice, but the coach says he will correct all the lapses before the next game. He also assures Pillars fans that they will go to Kumasi for a win. “We have everything to play for in Ghana. There is no reason to resort to defensive play. “The best form of defense attacks. We will play for goals, not to defend,” he emphasized. “We’ve seen our mistakes in the first leg, we will work hard to correct them before the return leg match. “We are going there for a win and move to the next round of the competition.” Kano Pillars will play one or two friendly games before traveling to Ghana for what the coach believes will be the turning point in their chase for a first CAF Champions League title. The Kano team has only gone as far as the semifinals of the competition in their six appearances in the competition.
