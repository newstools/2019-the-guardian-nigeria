The National Association of Nigerian Students Thursday pickets three South African companies in Abeokuta Ogun State to protest Xenophobic attacks on Nigerians living in their country. NANS Public Relations Officer Adeyemi Azeez who led the protest said Nigerian Students can no longer keep quiet while South Africans kill Nigerians and All South African business interests must leave Nigeria now among others. He said the protest will be held across the 36 states in Nigeria. The offices picketed by the student association were MTN office, MultiChoice DSTV, and Stanbic IBTC branch. The protesting students locked up the MTN  and MultiChoice offices in Oke-Ilewo. Security officers prevented them from locking up Stanbic IBTC bank. No fewer than 118 Nigerians have so far been killed in xenophobic attacks over the years. 13 of the victims died in the hands of South African policemen. On July 15, Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, condemned the continuous killings of Nigerians in South Africa, warning that the government will no longer tolerate further attacks on its citizens. “I believe we have faced enough, we will no longer take it anymore,” Lawan said when he hosted the South African High Commissioner to Nigeria, Bobby Moroe in Abuja. “We want to write the names of Nigerians killed, and the South African parliament must act fast to put a stop to this menace.” Lawan restated that the South African government should do whatever it takes to protect the lives and property of Nigerians living in that country, just as the Nigerian government would remain committed to the safety of South Africans living in Nigeria and their investments. He recalled Nigeria’s enormous contributions to South Africa during the Apartheid rule, adding: “We must establish events that led to the killings, including Mrs. Elizabeth Chukwu, who was killed recently in her hotel room.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
