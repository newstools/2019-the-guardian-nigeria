Family of the late 16-year-old altar server, Ezekiel Chukwu, who was murdered in a FESTAC Town club, has expressed concerns over deliberate flouting of police order restraining the club where he was allegedly killed from opening for business pending full investigation into the cause of his death. Ezekiel Chukwu had disappeared mysteriously on July 7 from 41 Road FESTAC, Lagos, close to the local government secretariat. Chukwu, an Anglican altar server in one of the popular churches at 41 Road, had attended the first and second services in the morning and returned home. He left home later in the evening to return for a special programme at the church but his lifeless body with blood dripping from his mouth and nose was found beside a pool in BAFT Club along 21 Road, FESTAC Town, the next day, July 8. Speaking with The Guardian, the father of the deceased, Mr. Emmanuel Chukwu, said it was disturbing that the management of the club has continued their business as usual despite the fact that the police authority asked them to shut down temporarily until investigations are concluded on his death. Chukwu alleged that the management of the club knows everything about the death of his son and should come clean on the matter. “It is most surprising that at this period of insecurity in the country that BAFT Club, which is one of the oldest around, where the body of the promising young boy was found dead in a swimming pool, when he was supposed to be in the church, has no CCTV camera and run a swimming pool without life guide or diver, neither do they keep or have particulars or records of people who make use of their facilities on a daily basis.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
