 Junior Agogo  Nigerian football followers will remember Agogo as the little known player, who knocked the Super Eagles out of the Ghana 2008 African Nations Cup in the quarterfinals on a Sunday evening in Accra. Nigeria took the lead in the first half of that match through a Yakubu Aiyegbeni penalty after Ikechukwu Uche was brought down by the Black Stars’ Captain, John Mensah. But former Chelsea star, Michael Essien equalized early in the second half when his looping header beat a badly positioned Austin Ejide. The game was poised at 1-1 going into the dying minutes of regular time when Agogo surfaced from nowhere to tap in a cross from the left flank to swing victory to the 10-man Ghanaians. Agogo became an instant hero to Ghanaians after the game and even though he did nothing more of significance after the competition, his name entered the Black Stars’ lores as the player who put the old enemy to the sword. He enjoyed a cult following during his 27-game stint with the Black Stars of Ghana scoring 12 goals.Agogo began his career with Sheffield United, playing three games between 1997 and 2000. He went on to score over 100 career goals after featuring for Bristol Rovers, Nottingham Forest, Oldham Athletic, Chester City, Lincoln City, Chicago Fire, Colorado Rapids, San Jose Earthquakes and Queens Park Ranger.He also played for Barnet, Zamalek SC, Apollon Limassol, and Hibernian.
