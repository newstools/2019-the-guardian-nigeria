The graduating students of Ronik Comprehensive School, Ejigbo, have been enjoined to avoid being intimidated by challenges in the journey of life if they want to get to the top. The Principal, Mrs Victoria Duru, who gave the charge at the 22nd valedictory and prize giving ceremony of the school, urged the graduating students to brace up for real challenges of life. Her words: “The future is no longer a distant reality. It is here now. Expect challenges on your way.  If you want to get to the top, you must make up your mind to surmount all obstacles on your way. You need determination, courage and hard work. Move on with your life head held high and your heart wide open. As Eleanor Roosevelt said, you need to know that there is something inside of you that is greater than any obstacle on your way.” She added that every experience of life would teach them something. All they needed to do is to open their hearts to see what lessons the world has to offer. The chairman of the occasion, Mr Benedict Ebalukhota, urged the graduating students to justify the sacrifice made by their parents towards successful completion of their secondary education. “You need to be strong. Just go out there and show the world the stuff you are made of. He urged the graduands to be proactive, eschew negative tendencies, be of good character and obey God in all their endeavors.” Managing Director and the Chief Executive Officer, Ronik group of schools, Mrs Rachel Alabi, tasked the graduands to be good ambassadors of the school.
