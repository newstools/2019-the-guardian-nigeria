Technology and social media have certainly made blind dating the most popular way of meeting people and getting into relationships. But as much as these experiences are fun, it is also necessary to stay safety conscious with these few tips: Inform a friend or family Always be sure to let a close friend or family member know exactly where you will be. Give them your date’s contact information as well. Permit them to check-in via phone or text once a while during the date, so they know you are safe and sound. Run A Background Check Fortunately, most platforms show if you have friends in common or some of the people he or she affiliates with; check each profile to have an idea of who you are dealing with. This is just for you to have as much information as possible beforehand; the more you know, the safer you will be. Information is power. Go Prepared Do not go on a blind date without enough money, a fully charged mobile phone, and external power source (i.e a fully charged power bank). Always make sure you are in control of how you get to the meeting point and how you get home. Meet in a Public Place When you meet someone new always meet them at a well-lit, public place that has plenty of people. Not only is it safer to meet in a crowded environment but people may remember you later if something goes wrong. Don’t Leave Your Food or Drink Unattended We’ve all heard about people’s food or drink being drugged or tampered with while on a date. Don’t leave anything up to chance and make sure you control your food and drink the entire time. Also, limit alcohol consumption so you can stay alert and safe.
