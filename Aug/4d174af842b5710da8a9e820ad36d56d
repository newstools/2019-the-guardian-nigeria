According to Deadline, Disney would be moving ahead with the movie adaptation of the New York Times best-selling epic fantasy and has enlisted the writer of ‘This Is Us’, Oyegun to pen the script. Oyegun would be joining ‘Dope’ director, Rick Famuyiwa who had earlier been tapped to direct the epic fantasy.  The right to the ‘Children Of Blood And Bone’ was bought by 20th Century Fox (before Disney bought Fox’s film assets), in what was termed “a remarkable pair of deals for a debut author“. Children Of Blood And Bone follows the story of Zélie Adebola who remembers when the soil of Orïsha hummed with magic. Burners ignited flames, Tiders beckoned waves, and Zélie’s Reaper mother summoned forth souls. But everything changed the night magic disappeared. Under the orders of a ruthless king, maji were killed, leaving Zélie without a mother and her people without hope. Now Zélie has one chance to bring back magic and strike against the monarchy. With the help of a rogue princess, Zélie must outwit and outrun the crown prince, who is hell-bent on eradicating magic for good. Danger lurks in Orïsha, where snow leoponaires prowl and vengeful spirits wait in the waters. Yet the greatest danger may be Zélie herself as she struggles to control her powers—and her growing feelings for an enemy.
