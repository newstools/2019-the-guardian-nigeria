Terminator: Dark Fate is set to be released soon, with Linda Hamilton returning to the iconic role of Sarah Connor. While we’ve already seen a preview of her in the role, the latest trailer for the James Cameron-produced and Tim Miller-directed sequel puts Connor in the spotlight, showing that she’s still got it even after 27 years. Set in a timeline that follows Terminator 2: Judgment Day and ignores the rest of the sequels (T3, Salvation, and Genisys), Dark Fate stars Hamilton, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mackenzie Davis, and Gabriel Luna among others. The clip shows Connor and Davis’ Grace fighting for their lives against Rev-9, a new Terminator sent back in time to kill the latter. And of course, it wouldn’t be a trailer for a new Terminator film without a reference to the classic first two entries: “I’ll be back,” Connor proclaims. The new trailer was announced via Instagram with a caption that read;
“Welcome to the day after #JudgmentDay. Watch the official trailer for #TerminatorDarkFate, in theatres 11.1.19.” https://www.instagram.com/tv/B1xh1P8HV60/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link The James Cameron produced movie would hit cinemas on the 1st of November 2019.
