 The twins, their mother and a caregiver on the floor.  Father of the babies, Mr. Gbenga Alayode, a 27-year-old fashion designer, said he is scared for the babies as they might die of cold, while sleeping on the floor. He said the twins were delivered through Ceaseran Section after their mother was rushed to the hospital. “When we got to the hospital, the medical bill was 500,000. I had N200,000 in my bank account and ran to family and friends to help me raise the rest but all the money I got was N425,000. The hospital management decided to move my wife and the twins from the bed to the floor. They refused the babies and their mother from leaving the hospital until we pay up. “I do not have a dime to feed the twins and even to get drugs for their mother who could barely talk. I cannot afford to buy the babies milk, clothes and other needs. The children have just five clothes each to wear, and the two cans of milk I bought are almost finished. I need financial assistance from government and Nigerians to help me settle the remaining bill and other expenses.” Also calling for help, a child rights advocate, Adeleke Success, said another newly delivered mother is being held in the same hospital over a bill of N80,000.”As if that was not enough, the same hospital was also asked to vacate her bed to the floor to give space for another woman. The woman who had a still-birth through Ceaseran Section is also being held over a balance of N80,000. Intervention would be appreciation as these people are in the hospital detention like criminals in police cell.”The twins father can be reached on 08146717951.
