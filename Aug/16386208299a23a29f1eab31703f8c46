A Professor of Geography at the Ekiti State University (EKSU), Ado Ekiti, Funso Isolaowa Afolabi, has cautioned the Federal Government against over-reliance on oil, saying that it may dry up someday. Afolabi urged the government to diversify and invest in tourism, which he said has the potentials to replace oil. The don made the call while delivering the institutions’ 54th inaugural lecture titled: Tourism Entrepreneurship: Putting Profit After Suitable Location and Sustainable Hotel Operations. Afolabi spoke about Caribbeans countries where tourism ranks first apart from industries and agriculture; Pacific countries where it ranks first from other sectors and also Kenya, where it is number one apart from industries and agriculture. “Nigeria has the potentials to replacing oil with tourism, so we should not fold our hands. If our oil dries, what are we going to do? This is why we are recommending that tourism should take over from oil. This we can do with strategic thinking,” he said.
