A midnight fire has razed over 80 shops at the biggest motor spare parts market in Edo State, popularly called ‘Uwelu Spare Parts Market’ located in Egor Local Government Area of the state. It was gathered that the midnight fire destroyed good worth millions of naira as some of the affected traders were said to have recently stocked their shops. Worst hit by the inferno were traders who deal on Mercedes Benz, Mazda, Ford and Toyota spare parts as the lines where they sold were completely razed down. The fire was said to have started at about 11:55p.m. on Monday and lasted till 4:00a.m. yesterday after efforts by fire service men from the University of Benin and the Nigerian Army eventually put out the fire. When The Guardian visited the burnt market, sympathisers were milling around while the affected traders were being consoled. A motor parts dealer, Mr. Daniel Okungbowa, who said he lost about N4 million worth of goods to the fire, said he deals in all types of fuel pumps and oil pumps. Another spare parts dealer, Mr. Festus Maxwell, lamented how the fire could spread wildly despite the fact that there was no power supply to the market. According to him: “We are yet to ascertain what actually happened that led to the fire incident. We could not remove anything from our shops. Many boys that just got freedom from their masters and opened their shops were also affected. They are yet to repay the loans they took from various banks.” Chairman of Spare-parts Dealers Association, Mr. Ibie Osaretin Augustine, said the incident has compounded the low patronage they were witnessing due to bad roads that lead to the market.Augustine said the four security guards hired by the traders were being questioned by the police over the incident.
