In what seem to be a odd play out of marriage, a woman in the United Arab Emirates has asked the court to dissolve her marriage because her husband shows her ‘too much love’, helps with the housework and showers her with gifts. According to reports, the UAE woman told a Sharia court in Fujairah that her ‘endearing’ husband has never argued or yelled at her and was always kind. When she complained about his weight, the man embarked on a strict  weight loss regime of dieting and exercise which left him with a broken leg. But this did not please the angry wife who still complained of his many gifts and compliments, according to local media. According to her: “I am eagerly longing for a single day of dispute, but this seems impossible with my romantic husband who always forgave me and showered me with daily gifts. ‘I need a real discussion, even an argument, not this hassle-free life full of obedience.” The husband begged the court to deny the divorce request. He told the court: “It’s not fair to judge a marriage from the first year, and everybody learns from their mistakes. I am and always wish to be a perfect and kind husband.” However, the court has adjourned the case to give the couple a chance to settle the dispute themselves. Meanwhile, back home in Nigerian celebrity media personality, Toke Makinwa has implored women to cause drama and “f**k sh*t up” so as to spice their relationship. This new take on relationship makes us ask that old question that, “What do women really want?”
