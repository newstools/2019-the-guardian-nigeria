Banned former Super Eagles coach, Samson Siasia has said he will address a press conference over the ban handed to him by world football authority, FIFA. The press conference is scheduled for 12 noon on Saturday at the National Stadium, Abuja. The former Nigeria U23 coach expressed shock at the decision by FIFA stating he was not invited to defend himself. He said he will fight to clear his name from the bribery scandal. “I don’t know anything about this. I did nothing wrong and I have not received any letter from FIFA,” he told Colin Udoh. Siasia was found guilty of having accepted that he would receive bribes in relation to the manipulation of matches in violation of the FIFA Code of Ethics by the adjudicatory chamber of the independent Ethics Committee. The adjudicatory chamber banned Siasia for life from all football-related activities (administrative, sports or any other) at both national and international level for breaching art. 11 (Bribery) of the 2009 edition of the FIFA Code of Ethics and banned him for life. Article 11 of the Code of Ethics says: “Officials may not accept bribes; in other words, any gifts or other advantages
that are offered, promised or sent to them to incite breach of duty or dishonest conduct for the benefit of a third party shall be refused. Officials are forbidden from bribing third parties or from urging or inciting others to do so in order to gain an advantage for themselves or third parties.” FIFA also imposed a fine of $51,051.66 on Siasia.
