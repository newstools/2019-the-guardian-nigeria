The American legends are now a part of Mattel’s Inspiring Women series, which also includes artist Frida Kahlo and NASA mathematician Katherine Johnson. According to Mattel’s series, Rosa Parks’ doll honours the woman who’s been called the “mother of the modern civil rights movement” for starting the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott in Alabama. It shows a young Parks in classic 1950s style, wearing a floral dress, coat, pillbox hat, glasses and gloves.

Naturally, she wears a blue flight suit and comes with a removable helmet and headset.

The new dolls which were made available for purchase from Monday, August 26  also includes historical role models Amelia Earhart, Katherine Johnson and Frida Kahlo in the collection.
