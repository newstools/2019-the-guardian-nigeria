His best years are ahead of him, he’s technically proficient and has the physical attributes we desire.” Danilo was part of the City squad that has won five domestic trophies in the past two seasons but has played second fiddle to Kyle Walker at right-back. “It’s been a pleasure to be part of the success City have enjoyed in my time here,” said Danilo, who has signed a five-year contract with Juventus. “The club have been fantastic with me from day one and I will always be grateful.”The Premier League title wins will stay with me forever and I will always have City in my heart.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
