New York Rapper ASAP Rocky was recently released from Swedish detention where he was held under assault charges and upon his return back home, he attended the latest edition of Kanye West’s ongoing Sunday Service series this weekend. As TMZ and others noted in the late Sunday/early Monday hours, Rocky was spotted talking with Kanye West and Kendall Jenner at the Calabasas gathering, which was famously adapted into a Coachella performance earlier this year. ASAP Ferg was also in attendance.   . . . . . . . #kanyewest #asaprocky #sunday #service #hypebeast #kanyesundayservice #sundayservice #justice #fashionkilla #freedom #complex #complexcon #theshaderoom A post shared by  OfAllPeople . (@oap.studios) on Aug 4, 2019 at 4:42pm PDT  Just two days earlier, Rocky had left Sweden following detention in connection with an alleged assault case Rocky and his team have argued was a matter of self-defense. Last Friday, a judge announced that Rocky and his co-defendants in the controversial case could be released ahead of the announcement later this month of a verdict.   何はともあれ出てこれて良かったですね #hiphop #freeasaprocky #asaprocky  #Repost @power_106 with @get_repost ・・・ #ASAPRocky spotted at #SundayService with #ASAPFerg & #KendallJenner  | : @chucky.blk @complex A post shared by  Nobu Koike (@djpon) on Aug 4, 2019 at 1:29pm PDT  “I can’t begin to describe how grateful I am for all of you,” Rocky told fans and supporters via Instagram upon his release. “This has been a very difficult and humbling experience.
