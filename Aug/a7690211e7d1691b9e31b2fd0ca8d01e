American rapper, Rakim Mayers better known by his stage name A$AP Rocky has been found guilty of assault. This verdict is coming for the rapper’s role in a street brawl in Stockholm, Sweden. A$AP Rocky who spent several days in Swedish jail while awaiting trial had earlier testified that his actions were in self-defence as he had tried to avoid a confrontation with two men who he said were persistently following his entourage on 30 June.

It would be recalled that the 30-year-old rapper and his two bodyguards were released on 2 August pending the verdict.
