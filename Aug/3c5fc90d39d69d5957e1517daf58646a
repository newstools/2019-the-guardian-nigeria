 Christ Holy Church International  Also known as the Nation Builders, the Church gave the advice during its monthly programme in Lagos. It’s General Overseer, Reverend Daniel Okoh said: “There are so many ways of doing one thing successfully. The Federal Government should take the policy back to the drawing table. “It should find other ways of sustaining that part of agriculture in a way that it will not bring the conflict in the country. People can still rear cattle without necessarily getting a settlement in areas other than their own.” Okoh also enjoined all Nigerians to toe the path of peace in the face of provocation, adding: “We know we have other means of resolving issues and bringing about peaceful co-existence. “It is our responsibility as Christians to continue to seek better ways of resolving conflicts in a peaceful manner because when people go to war, they end up later at the negotiation table. We need to negotiate and get ourselves committed to resolving whatever crisis that exists.” He also advised the government to develop those places that have accepted to host the Fulani herdsmen in their communities.
