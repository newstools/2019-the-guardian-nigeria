Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Durumi camp, Abuja have expressed displeasure at their state of living and accused the Nigerian government and officials of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) of ‘total neglect’. The IDPs said the government officials abandoned them to wallow in lack of food and care. “It’s sad that as IDPs, we have been neglected by the authorities. For some time now, food and other supplies have not gotten to us. We have endured grumbling with the situation caused by the insecurity that made us flee from our ancestral homes,”  IDPs simply identified as Maria said during a visit by Rochas Foundation. The foundation led by its founder Senator Rochas Okorocha, former Imo State governor, promised to build a school for the IDPs in the camp. “This is in line with the aim of the foundation under its READ program to ensure that kids in the camp are given a shot in life through,” the foundation said in a Facebook post. He said the proposed school facility was part of efforts of the Rochas Foundation which has successfully built 11 schools across the country since inception to provide qualitative and free education for indigent students. Okorocha and other members of the foundation handed food items and other needs to the IDPs. The IDPs expressed gratitude to the Rochas Foundation for a gesture they described as a “timely and impactful” to their well-being. Two IDPs at the camp, who simply gave their names as Salamatu and Dahiru, thanked Okorocha and members of the foundation.
