Alhaji Saleh Mohammed, the paramount ruler of Kaltungo, Gombe State, has urged Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) to return and rebuild their respective communities following relative peace recorded in the country. Mohammed made the appeal in Kaltungo on Sunday in his Sallah message while speaking with newsmen.
