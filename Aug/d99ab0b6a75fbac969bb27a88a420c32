Onyinye Mbadike The police in Lagos State have arrested a 24-year-old Onyinye Mbadike for allegedly torturing a minor and locking him in a kennel. The incident happened at Trimnell Street, Aguda, and was leaked in a video that went viral on social media. The Lagos police spokesperson, Bala Elkana, said the police have arrested the suspect. He said Mbadike would be charged to court for allegedly abusing 10-year-old Chibike Eziamaka. The video showed how the suspect flogged the child and forced him to share space with other dogs kept in the kennel. The scene was reportedly filmed by a neighbour. According to the statement of the suspect, “she only locked him in an empty kennel where bags are kept. She claimed to have locked up the boy for a few hours before bringing him out. She alleged that the boy took a ‘hot’ drink in their refrigerator and was misbehaving. Also, the suspect alleged that the victim smashed the side mirror of her Toyota Camry.” Chibike is an orphan and a cousin to Mbadike, the police said. He was brought to Lagos from Anambra State in 2012 alongside his two siblings by Mbadike’s mother. Mbadike was arrested by a team of detectives from the Gender Unit, Lagos Police Command while the victim has been rescued and taken to a secure place.
