The Rotaractors evacuating refuse from a dumpsite in Agege Members of the Rotaract Club of Agege and Leo Club of Ifako Ijaiye have carried out a joint sanitation, clearing heaps of refuse between Iyana Ipaja roundabout and Orile Agege Local Council Development Area (LCDA). Speaking on the reason for the project, president of the Rotaract Club of Agege, Rashidat Raheem, said disease prevention is one of the six focus areas of Rotary International. “One of the surest ways of preventing disease is a healthy lifestyle, which begins with a healthy environment. Living in a clean environment is important to our physical health and overall sense of wellbeing. We need a clean environment so we can live healthy and leave a healthy Earth for future generations,” she said. Raheem added that keeping the environment clean is a collective task of citizens; reason they are spearheading the campaign. She noted that one of the refuse sites is close to a primary school. “This is not good for the health of the pupils and everyone around the area and pupils in a couple of days would resume from the holidays. “That is why the club cleared the site. Sanitation is one of the most important aspects of community wellbeing because it protects human health and extends the life span,” she said. The project was sponsored by the Rotary Club of Agege led by Rtn. Emmanuel Eneh as president and Rtn. Victoria Kappo as director of Youth Development. Kappo noted that the club was collaborating with the LCDA to make the environment clean by sensitizing residents and community leaders on healthy living. Last year, the Rotaractors evacuated tons of waste from Powerline area, Ota Road in Orile Agege. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
