Onalaja A twenty-five-year-old orphan, Adeniyi Onalaja, who is a generating set repairer, has been in the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Idi-Araba, Lagos for the last three months, after undergoing a surgery on his stomach. His ordeal began when he experienced severe stomachache and decided to see the doctor at a hospital at Agbowa, Ikorodu, Lagos. He was eventually referred to LUTH on April 4, 2019. On medical examination, he was advised to undergo a CT-Scan. The scan showed that he had a tumour in his stomach and he was scheduled for an emergency surgery, which was carried on April 10, 2019, after signing an undertaking that funds would be made available. Afterwards, there was a little complication that made him undergo another surgery, because he could not neither sleep nor eat on April 23, 2019. He has since been a resident of Ward E6 at the hospital. According to Onalaja, who hails from Ijebu-Ode, his father died on 2006 and his mother died, a month ago. He is currently owing the hospital about N600, 000, which include expenses incurred from the surgery, admission, laundry and drugs from the pharmacy. The orphan said he is currently living on the remnants of other patients on admission in the ward because he has nobody. He expressed his readiness to fend for himself through his generating set repairing skills, if he has the opportunity to leave the hospital. He is appealing to well-meaning Nigerians, to please, help him out of his travail. Adeniyi Onalaja can be reached on 08164635903.
