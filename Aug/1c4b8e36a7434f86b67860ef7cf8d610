The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has cautioned the Federal Government against engaging in vote buying in Bayelsa and Kogi states, as the gubernatorial elections draw nearer. It also declared that it would not be stampeded into rushing the conduct of its primaries in both states. PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, stated at a media briefing in Abuja yesterday that in the case of Bayelsa, “the process is on and the party has not reached any conclusion in respect of the issues involved. The party is still holding meetings in that respect. “It is misplaced for anybody or group of persons to say that the party has taken a decision and allege that the National Chairman had played a role in whatever form in the process. “We have constituted committees that will conduct the election to produce the three ad-hoc delegates from each ward. And I can say that the governors, who chaired those committees, did well and as such, other processes will follow,” he stated. Besides, the Governorship Primary Election Screening Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa State has disqualified former Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in Cross Rivers State, Dr. Frankland Briyai, for not being as card-carrying member in the past one year. It, however, cleared former Minister of State for Agriculture, Heineken Lokpobiri, Preye Aganaba, Ebitimi Angbare, Diseye Poweigha, Lyon David and Prof. Ongoebi Etebu. The committee, headed by Isa Song and Secretary, Clement Chinaka, in its address to the National Secretary of APC, stated that only Briyai was not cleared after a thorough exercise in Yenagoa last Saturday. The report also stated that aspirants’ original credentials must be sighted and aspirants with multiple declarations of age must harmonise same to avoid untoward situation. Meanwhile, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said it had concluded plans to distribute over 49, 000 Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) in order not to disfranchise persons from voting in the Bayelsa gubernatorial poll. INEC’s Resident Electoral Commission (REC) in Bayelsa, Monday Udoh, disclosed this in Yenagoa yesterday during a stakeholders’ forum on modalities for collection of the facilities. Udoh, who was represented by INEC’s Executive Secretary in the state, Boco Ekong, said the distribution would commence on September 2 in Yenagoa and all local government areas.
