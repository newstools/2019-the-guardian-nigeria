 Girl-child. PHOTO: voanews  Kolade who made the plea at the opening of the 2019 August Girls’ Assembly (AGA) organised by Worth-in-Womanhood arm of Vine Branch Ministries said to secure the country’s future, the Federal Government must play its role in bringing out the best in the girl-child. She said, “Without education, human beings are no better than animals, so our children must know that compulsorily they must be in school. Any parent who does not put his ward in school should be arrested because the child does not have a say of his own. “Sometimes, when you go round the city, you will see children of three to four years hawking, parents of such youngsters should be arrested if the government is serious about changing our future. Those who are put in air-conditioned schools, their lives would be at the risk of those roaming the streets because of lack of education. Kolade who is the coordinator of AGA stressed the need to inform girls on how to protect themselves from sexual abuse, which is daily on the increase. “Our focus, more than ever before is to let the girl-child know that she is vulnerable by virtue of her makeup though she is loaded with beauty, honour, and grace from God. So, she must be very careful about how she handles herself against sexual abuses in particular.” She further said the event, which is aimed at imparting 2000 girls in Oyo State with the right information is to promote godliness in girls.
