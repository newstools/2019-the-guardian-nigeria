Enyimba • Suspends Governor, Chukwude for unruly behaviour
Nigeria champions, Enyimba of Aba have entered the second phase of their preparation for their CAF Champions League first round tie against Burkina Faso’s Rahimo FC. According to officials of the club, the team elected to train for the game in Aba to give their new players the time to blend into the squad, which lost four top stars after the Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) play-offs. The Guardian learnt that Coach Usman Abd’Allah will choose 18 players for the game, which will hold at Ouagadougou in the weekend of August 9 to 11. Enyimba’s Jude Anyadufu told The Guardian yesterday that “we decided to prepare for the match in Aba because we have eight new players, who have not yet mastered our pattern. “We hope to travel to Burkina Faso on August 7 or 8 for the game, which will hold in their capital city. “Already, we have put the process in motion for a smooth journey to Burkina Faso.” Anyadufu added that the time is too short to take the team to a secluded location, adding, however, “when we come back, depending on the situation, we will decide whether it would be profitable to camp the boys outside Aba.” The first leg of the tie will be played in Burkina Faso from August 9 to11, before the People’s Elephant return home for the reverse fixture two weeks later. Meanwhile, Enyimba have suspended defender Ernest Governor and forward Stephen Chukwude for what the team termed disruptive behaviour. The team wrote on their official page, “Enyimba Football Club have handed indefinite suspensions to defender Ernest Governor and forward Stephen Chukwude for gross misconduct. “The suspensions take effect immediately and will be without pay.” The Guardian learnt that the players were being punished for their unruly behaviour at the club’s training session on Tuesday.
