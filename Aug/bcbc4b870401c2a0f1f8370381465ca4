 [FILES] Shehu Sani  In a statement by the state Chairman, Alhaji Abdulrahaman Danbirni, he said the Tribunal Chairman, Justice A. H. Suleiman’s ruling, is nothing but “a judicial coronation of fraud and two hours of hot air wasted to canonise chicanery.” He said the tribunal failed to grant the party’s request to recount the votes, adding that the defendant and APC candidate never presented a witness to justify his victory.He noted that Governor Nasir El-Rufai’s personal attorney represented the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) at the tribunal Danbirni also noted that the tribunal did not inform its candidate, Shehu Sani’s legal counsel of the date of the ruling, saying, “The ruling represents a rape of justice and the crowning and glorification of electoral robbery.” “We maintain that our candidate for the 2019 National Assembly poll, Shehu Sani, won the Kaduna Central Senatorial Elections. Our candidate’s votes were clean and their votes were embellished, padded and fused with steroids, typical of their bogus integrity and dubious honesty.” But Uba Sani’s supporters trooped out in their numbers to celebrate his victory at the Tribunal. The Tribunal in its judgement yesterday declared that the petitioner, Shehu Sani failed to convince the Tribunal that the 2019 National Assembly election that produced Uba Sani were marred by irregularities. Therefore, Justice H A Suleiman struck out the petition for lack of merit, which resulted in jubilation and chanting of victory and solidarity songs by Uba Sani’s supporters at his campaign office on Kachia Road, Kaduna. Speaking on behalf of the supporters, Sule Mahmoud said, “The Tribunal has finally ruled that Senator Uba Sani won the election and we are very happy about it.But the PRP has vowed to challenge the judgement at the Appeal Court.
