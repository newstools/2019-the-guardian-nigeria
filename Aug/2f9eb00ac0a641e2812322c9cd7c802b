Nigeria’s presidency Monday said President Muhammadu Buhari is not indifferent to the killings of three policemen and a civilian by soldiers in Taraba state. “In response to press questions, I will confirm that a committee was set up during the National Security Council meeting to investigate the killing of three policemen and a civilian by soldiers in Taraba State.” Buhari’s spokesman Garba Shehu said in a statement on Monday. “The President is not indifferent to the unfortunate incident, and would take decisive action as soon as the report of the panel is submitted to him,” he added. Three policemen – an Inspector and two Sergeants – and a civilian were on a covert operation in Taraba State when they were killed on Wednesday by the Nigerian troops. The Nigerian army said the shooting to death was an error, stating that the policemen were suspected to be kidnappers after they refused to stop three consecutive times at army checkpoints. But while reacting to the killings an assistant superintendent of police, Vincent Maxwell, on Thursday said the officers killed by soldiers in Taraba State were among the best on the inspector-general of police’s intelligence response team (IRT). Many Nigerians have also criticised the president’s silence over the issues and demanded he brings the soldiers involved to justice. Shehu, however, noted that Buhari is following due process and procedure as “putting the cart before the horse is not President Buhari’s way of doing things.” He said the president had ordered the chief of defence staff to set up an investigation committee with representatives from all the security organizations in the country. “Nigerians should show patience while the President awaits the report of the panel from the Chief of Defence Staff,” Shehu said.
