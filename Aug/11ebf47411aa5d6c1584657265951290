American comedian and television host, Steve Harvey, was moved to tears on his tour of the slave trade site in Ghana. Steve Harvey along with his family visited the Elmina Castle on the Cape Coast, Ghana. The Harvey family was given a tour of the historical site and briefed on the dark past of the trading post that was erected by the Portuguese in the 1400s. Harvey captured his emotions in his Instagram post: This was real pain I felt going back to Ghana’s slave castles…I could feel my ancestors on me… Powerful beyond words that I can explain. I encourage as many of you as possible to go HOME for your ancestors. Their strength is in each of us and we must honor their ultimate sacrifice in all that we do. #TheYearofTheReturn   This was real pain I felt going back to Ghana’s slave castles…I could feel my ancestors on me… Powerful beyond words that I can explain.

The Obama family shared similar emotions in 2009 when they made a trip to the Elmina Castle. This is indeed the year of the return, Hollywood star Samuel L. Jackson recently traced his roots to the Bantu tribe in Gabon. The Hollywood veteran found out his ancestry through Finding Your Roots, an American docu-series that uses genealogical research and genetics to discover the family history of celebrities.
