The authorities called on residents to stay vigilant regarding mudslides, swollen rivers and high waves. Krosa caused the cancellation of 720 flights and a large number of train services in western Japan, leaving travellers stranded at the height of the summer holiday season, broadcaster NHK reported. As of 3.00 p.m. (0600 GMT), the eye of the storm was around the city of Kure in Hiroshima prefecture, travelling north at 30 kilometres per hour. It was recording maximum sustained winds of 90 kilometres per hour and gusts of 126 kilometres per hour, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. Rainfall of up to 500 millimetres is forecast for the south-western island of Shikoku and up to 400 millimetres for the Tokai region by Friday noon, the agency said. In July 2018, torrential rains in western Japan triggered floods and landslides, killing more than 220 people â€“ the highest number of deaths from a single weather event in three decades.
