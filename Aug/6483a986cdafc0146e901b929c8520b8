 Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, John Cardinal Onaiyekan  Speaking at a mass to mark his 50th Priestly Ordination yesterday, in Abuja, Onaiyekan observed that the Fulanis should be worried about the rate, at which they were being mentioned for something evil. He stressed the need for them to take urgent measures to rid themselves of bad eggs who are giving the Fulanis a bad name, because “people are saying that every attack in the country right now is perpetrated by Fulani herdsmen. “If I am a Fulani, I will do whatever it takes to advise them to stop giving the Fulanis a bad name, because people are saying that every attack in the country right now is perpetrated by Fulani herdsmen. Many who where kidnapped, after their release report that their kidnappers were Fulani herdsmen, if we can start by cleaning up the Fulani camps so that those using the Fulani names for evil will not do so anymore’’.
