Ed Sheeran has released yet another music video from new album No.6 Collaborations Project titled “Nothing on You” which features rappers Paulo Londra and Dave. The video which shows Sheeran biking around London was directed by SBTV, the online broadcasting channel that presented Sheeran as an emerging artist in his first live session of “You Need Me, I Don’t Need You” back in 2010. Sheeran recently broke the record for the most attended and highest-grossing tour of all time with his Divide tour, which is set to close this month after a two-and-a-half-year run.
