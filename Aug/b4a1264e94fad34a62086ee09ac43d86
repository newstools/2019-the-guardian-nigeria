• We Don’t Have Power To Arrest And Detain, But They Are With Us, EFCC Says
The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) said it has in its custody, Uyi Giwa Osagie, a long-time legal adviser to Alhaji Atiku Abuakar, and Abdullahi Babalele, the former Vice-President’s son-in-law. EFCC’s acting spokesperson, Tony Orilade who disclosed this to The Guardian in a telephone interview denied that the commission did not arrest the duo, instead he said that they honoured the commission’s invitation. According to Orilade, the commission is ready to take them to Court and present fact. His words: “We did not arrest anybody, they honoured our invitation. Whereas, we don’t have power to detain anybody, but what I can tell you is that they are with us. “The story is not different, everybody is aware of the story and that is the reason why we are charging them,” Orilade noted. Osagie and Babalele were taken into custody on Thursday evening, according to sources familiar with the development. They were arrested after honouring an EFCC invitation in Lagos, sources said.
The Guardian learnt that the commission was set to arraign Giwa-Osagie for alleged money laundering. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
