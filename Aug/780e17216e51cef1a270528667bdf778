The Permanent Secretary also restated government’s commitment to the welfare of athletes stating that no single athlete or participant representing Nigeria is being owed any benefits or allowances. “My attention was drawn to a report in an online medium in which an athlete appealed to the Honourable Minister to pay their entitlements. Those of you who have participated in international competitions since my coming on board in 2018 will attest to it that the ministry under my watch is not owing any athlete, rather we have gone further to support athletes on their medical needs, supported athletes with scholarships grants but having difficulty in meeting up with the front end costs. Through the Nigeria Olympic Committee and other Federations, we have secured scholarships for over 20 athletes.” Mr. Olusade also restated that the 12th African Games would serve as a qualifying event for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games (with few exceptions) in Athletics, Badminton, Canoe/Kayak, Cycling, Handball, Judo, Swimming, Table Tennis, Taekwondo, Tennis, Beach Volleyball and Weightlifting.He congratulated the gold medalists in the mentioned sports who he said have already booked their spots at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.The first batch of awards was for athletes who won laurels in Taekwondo, Table Tennis, Badminton, Gymnastics, Karate, Athletics, Basketball and Weightlifting.
