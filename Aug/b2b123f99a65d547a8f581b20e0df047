It has a population of over 2 million in a country that is twice the size of California.  Only Mongolia is less populous. With this population, they house 13 ethnic groups. Also, the citizens speak up to 30 languages. The most popular of these is Oshiwambo. English is the recognized official language. Namibia is the first country in the world to incorporate environmental protection in their constitution. This makes it very open to tourists for tourism. Namibia homes the second largest canyon in the world. The Fish River Canyon, located close to the border with South Africa, is also the oldest in the world. Researchers have determined that the canyon was formed at least 500 million years ago through water and wind erosion, coupled with the collapse of the valley floor. The skeleton coast in Namibia serves as the biggest grave site for sailors. In the 1940’s, a slate was discovered along with human skeletons. The slate was written by a survivor and directed anyone who found it north. Unfortunately, the wreck had happened close to a century earlier.
