Imo State Governor Emeka Ihedioha list listed his achievements in his first 100 days in Douglas House. His special assistant on Research, Ogubundu Nwadike, stated yesterday that the state government recorded over 20 accomplishments in its first 100 days. Nwadike was reacting to the ‘First 100 Days’ assessment standard used in measuring the ability of new political leaderships, which made popular some 87 years ago by the 32nd President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt. Ihedioha, and many of the new governors would be marking their first 100 days in office on September 5. Nwadike argued that the first step in recording quality achievements was in the ability of a leader to have the right human capital in place. “Right from the beginning, Governor Ihedioha set up a Transition Technical Committee (TTC), which worked and provided the guiding template for the rebuilding of Imo. The TTC comprised some of the best intellectuals, technocrats and professionals. It was very thorough in providing the compass by which the new administration will be navigated. I am privileged to know that the governor and his administration have decided to religiously abide by the step-by-step guide of the recommendation by the TTC,” he said. The government, he added, believes in following due process in awarding contracts “That is why on September 4, the government will flag off the rehabilitation of 16 major roads in the three senatorial zones of the state after diligent procedure had been completed in their award.” According to him, in the first 100 days, every segment of the state has been touched, including floods and erosion control, water scheme, education, health and security. He said the civil servants now receive full salaries while the verification of pensioners, who were last paid in 2015, would soon be completed for them to begin receiving their pay.
