 PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan  The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) alleged on Friday that the Buhari Presidency is rotten and reeks of incurable corruption, festering up to every level.The party, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, claimed that the shocking revelations of multi-dimensional sleazes, bribery, stealing and extortions in President Buhari’s Special Investigation Panel for Recovery of Public Property, as well as in the office of the Head of Service of the Federation (HOSF), are just a tip of the iceberg of the corruption deeply entrenched in the Buhari Presidency. The party stated: “Nigerians are aware of how the indicted Chairman of the Special Investigation Panel, Okoi Obono-Obla and the Head of Service, Winifred Oyo-Ita, enjoyed the protection of the cabal in the Buhari Presidency in its brazen burglary of our common patrimony.
“Nigerians can also recall how the PDP had severally raised the issue of humongous fraud going on in the Special Investigation Panel under Obono-Obla as well as the chairman’s certificate forgery allegation, and how President Buhari condoned him and refused to take immediate action.” According to the PDP, “the Buhari Presidency should therefore know that Nigerians are not carried away by this new attempt to hoodwink them through the usual holier than thou script.” The party added: “If President Buhari is indeed serious about exposing corruption, he should immediately allow a system-wide probe into the activities of his administration in the last four years, particularly the trillions of naira sleazes in the Ministry of Petroleum Resources where he was minister.” The PDP demanded that President Buhari should allow “an inquest into the stolen N9 trillion as detailed in the leaked NNPC memo, the reported stealing of N1.1 trillion worth of crude by interests connected to the All Progressives Congress (APC) as well as alleged diversion of billions of naira meant for security and social welfare in our country.” It continued: “Our party now expects President Buhari to allow an investigation into the revelation by the First Lady, Aisha Buhari, that the N500 billion Social Investment Programme and the N16 billion Mosquito Net Project of his administration were diverted to private purses. “This is in addition to persons close to him, who as former ministers and former governors are facing corruption charges in various panels and courts, including a former minister indicted in the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) N2.5 billion fraud case.”The party therefore asked the Presidency to speak out on the allegations in public space that Obono-Obla’s investigation activities at the Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF), which the “presidency cabal” is desperate to conceal, is what is being punished. “Now that President Buhari appears resolved to take the right step to investigate Obono-Obla’s certificate forgery scandal, it has also become incumbent on him to purge his conscience by owning up on his own certificate saga,” it noted.
