Oyo State governor Seyi Makinde has approved a bursary of N500,000 for indigenes of the state at the Nigerian Law School. “Representatives of Oyo State indigenes at the Nigerian Law School visited me today. I approved the sum of N500,000 to be paid as bursary to each Oyo State indigene at the Law School,” Makinde tweeted Tuesday evening. Makinde said the bursary approval was a show of his administration’s value for education. He expressed optimism that his decision will encourage the students and spur them to great heights in their academic pursuit. Makinde urged the students to contribute their quota towards the development of the state and Nigeria after their studies. The Oyo State governor has made several moves to improve the quality of education in the state. Prior to the bursary approval, Makinde had placed a ban on illegal fee collections in all schools owned by the state government during his inauguration. A circular released by the Head of Service, Mrs Amidat Ololade Agboola, which was directed to Permanent Secretaries and Heads of education-related Agencies announced the ban. “Therefore, collection of fees/levies in all Public Primary and Secondary Schools, including Technical Colleges across the State is hereby prohibited. “I’m to emphasize that collection of fees under any guise in Public Schools across the State remains illegal and any violator of this directive will be treated as a saboteur; heavy sanction awaits violators of this directive,” Agboola said in the circular.
