Members of the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party (PDP) in Ibarapa North Local Council of Oyo State yesterday called for the nullification of 27-year-old Fakorede Oluwaseun as commissioner-nominee. Chairman of the party in the council, Mr. Samuel Adigun, who spoke with newsmen at the entrance of the Assembly, said the people of the council were not satisfied with the nominee as he is seen not to be a member of the party. But while Fakorede said it was an internal matter that would be settled in due course, the Speaker, Adebo Ogundoyi, said that the nomination of the 27-year-old commissioner was part of the manifestation of Not- Too-Young-To-Run Bill in the state.
