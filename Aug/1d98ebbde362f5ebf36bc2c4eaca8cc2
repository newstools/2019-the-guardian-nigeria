The Ekiti State Police Command yesterday confirmed that a middle-aged woman, Mrs Bukola Olarewaju, who was murdered in Ado Ekiti on Thursday, was raped and strangulated by her killer. A tenant and commercial motorcycle operator allegedly raped and killed Olanrewaju at Olorunda area of the state capital. The man, who was a tenant to the mother of three, reportedly fled after committing the nefarious act. Speaking with journalists in Ado Ekiti, the Command’s Public Relations Officer, Caleb Ikechukwu, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), said the suspect after raping the woman also strangled her to death. He said that medical examination conducted on the body of the deceased at the Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital (EKSUTH) confirmed that she was raped before being strangled to death by her assailant. “Medical examination confirmed the above but we have not been able to ascertain who actually committed the crime and what actually led to that. “Apart from this, we saw condoms and semen within the scene where the crime was committed, which also substantiated the fact she was actually raped. “We were told that a man, who was a neighbour actually did it and fled. We are yet to arrest the man but proper security arrangements have been made that would ensure the speedy arrest of the suspect,” he said. Ikechukwu said the deceased’s husband had deposited the corpse at EKSUTH morgue, adding that investigation was ongoing on the matter.
