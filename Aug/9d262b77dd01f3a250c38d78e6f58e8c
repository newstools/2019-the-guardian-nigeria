Last night on the ongoing reality TV show, Big Brother Naija saw the exit of two housemates in the persons of Jackye and Gedoni.

In this article, we focus on Jackye and as we have done for other housemates, we have gathered quick facts you should know about her. BBNaija Jackye | Photo â€“ BellaNaija
