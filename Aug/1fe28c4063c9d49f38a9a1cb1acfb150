 Greensprings  According to the information published by the International Baccalaureate Organisation (IBO), which is the international body in charge of the sixth-form programme, the average scores of the Greensprings students in the 12 subjects exceeded that of the 1,214 schools in 94 countries that did the examination. They listed the subjects in which the students beat the world average to include English Language, literature, mathematics, biology, computer science, business management, and psychology, among others. Reacting to the report, the IB Diploma coordinator of  Greensprings School, Mr Abidemi Arimoro, said the publication of the statistics showed that if given quality education, Nigerian students can compete favourably with their counterparts all over the world, and even surpass them. He also remarked that the students showed a lot of determination and put in a great deal of work. Therefore, all of their achievements are well-deserved.
