We’ve all had those days, when we wake up in the morning, getting ready to hit the day and, all of a sudden, we’re stuck on what to wear. Most times, we feel we’ve exhausted all our clothes (even when it’s not true), or we do not know what would be appropriate for that particular occasion. When you feel like you have nothing to wear, stick to basics. For this writing and to make it as simple as possible to understand and as realistic as possible to realize, it’d be divided into day and night. Day Except you work in a strictly professional setting that requires you to wear a uniform, the best bet is to go with your style which does not violate your office policy. Being more formal on Mondays than you would be on Fridays is, of course, expected. For Women: Mondays through Wednesdays, opt for a pencil skirt or fitted trousers paired with a button-down shirt. This communicates to people that you’re a career lady without the hassles of a suit. Thursdays and Fridays could be a bit more casual. A pair of jeans and a t-shirt and heels (or sneakers) would always work.

The addition of a blazer would be influenced by weather, personal style or job description. Thursdays and Fridays, go for the normal traditional look but instead of pairing it with a palm slipper, use sandals instead but not shoes. <img class="alignnone wp-image-987003 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/men-work-wear-Credit-Pinterest-1.jpg" alt="" width="820" height="1230" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/men-work-wear-Credit-Pinterest-1.jpg 820w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/men-work-wear-Credit-Pinterest-1-399x598.jpg 399w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/men-work-wear-Credit-Pinterest-1-768x1152.jpg 768w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/men-work-wear-Credit-Pinterest-1-371x557.jpg 371w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/men-work-wear-Credit-Pinterest-1-743x1114.jpg 743w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/men-work-wear-Credit-Pinterest-1-160x240.jpg 160w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/men-work-wear-Credit-Pinterest-1-320x480.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/men-work-wear-Credit-Pinterest-1-400x600.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px" /> Night What you wear at night depends on where you’re going. The club might require sequins and shorter hemlines while a date might require something classier. Whatever the occasion though, some looks are so classic they’d work anywhere. For Women: A little black dress is a way to go, whether you’re heading to the club, a night out with the girls or a date with that special someone. Getting this dress in different designs and different fabrications. Do not be afraid to go for sequins and cutouts.

A night out with the boys or for clubbing, opt for a pair of jeans, a white t-shirt, and a bomber or jean jacket with sneakers.
