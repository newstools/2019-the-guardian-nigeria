Medics from the Magen David Adom rescue service said a 17-year-old was in critical condition and being treated at the scene. It gave the ages of the two others as 46 and 20. Israeli security forces were deployed throughout the area, AFP journalists reported. Further details were not yet available on the incident. Palestinian attacks on Israeli settlers and security forces occur sporadically in the West Bank, occupied by Israel since the 1967 Six-Day War. There have been concerns of a possible increase in violence in the run-up to Israel’s September 17 elections. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
