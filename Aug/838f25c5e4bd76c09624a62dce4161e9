Sorry to disappoint movie lovers and fans of Jason Momoa but it appears that we would not be having Aquaman 2 on the screen anytime soon. Momoa whose birth name is Joseph Jason Namakaeha Momoa wants Warner Bros to halt production on Aquaman 2. Momoa made this call due to his involvement in a protest against a construction project known as Thirty Meter Telescope being built in his homeland, Hawaii. The Game of Thrones star is unhappy about the project to build a giant telescope on Hawaii’s tallest mountain, Mauna Kea. Mauna Kea is considered the most sacred place on earth to Indigenous Hawaiians. Momoa made known his displeasure on his Instagram page: “FUCK THIS. And TMT is 4x bigger. Sorry Warner Bros we can’t shoot Aquaman 2. Because Jason got run over by a bulldozer trying to stop the desecration of his native land THIS iS NOT HAPPENING. WE ARE NOT LETTING YOU DO THIS ANYMORE. Enough is enough. Go somewhere else. Repost. This is what telescope construction looks like (Subaru Telescope, 1992). The TMT will be four times larger on unscathed land. We must protect our scared mountain from further desecration. #KuKiaiMauna #WeAreMaunaKea#TMTShutdown“   FUCK THIS.  And TMT is 4x bigger.  Sorry Warner Bros we can’t shoot Aquaman 2.

Momoa is not alone in this, some weeks back Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson also joined the protest against the construction in Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The Rock “It’s not about stopping science. It’s about respecting a culture and respecting a people, and doing things the right way. When things escalate to that emotional apex, that is a sign that something has to be done. And to full-charge-ahead isn’t the way to do it. And, as I shared with the crowd today, the world is watching. And the world is saying we should take a pause. And this is where care and decency and love and respect for not only culture but for humanity really comes into play. This is a steadfast culture. The protest are so peaceful, yet so powerful. And no one’s going anywhere. And so, I’m optimistic that something positive is going to come out of this.”   Celebrity Dwayne (@therock) Johnson shares his thoughts on the #ThirtyMeterTelescope and conflict on #MaunaKea. . #HawaiiNewsNow #HawaiiNews #HINews #HNN A post shared by  Chelsea Davis (@chelseadavishnn) on Jul 24, 2019 at 5:49pm PDT
