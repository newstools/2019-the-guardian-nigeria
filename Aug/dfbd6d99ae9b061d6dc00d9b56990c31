Popular Nigerian artiste, Tekno who was spotted with some semi-nude girls dancing on a strippers’ pole along Lekki, Lagos, an act many condemned was never arrested, his manager, Sydorff, has said. Sydorff, in an interview with The PUNCH, explained that the singer was not arrested, instead, he was ‘invited to clear the air’. “Tekno was never arrested by the police. They requested our presence and they told us to please come and clear the air about the whole issue. When we got to the station it was not as if anyone was arrested”, Sydorff said. Sydorff explained that the whole incident was just the shoot for the video to Tekno’s new single “Agege”. “We just chilled there for a while. We drove there and we left. It was not like anything happened. We spent about one hour and thirty minutes with the police and we left. Everything has been settled now. Initially, there was no problem, it was just the way people escalated the situation. We did not do anything illegal.” Sydorff also reiterated that Agege video would soon be out and revealed Tekno’s album, Old Romance, would be ready by September.
