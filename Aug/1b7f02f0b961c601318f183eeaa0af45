The Obi of Onitsha, His Majesty, Igwe Nnaemeka Alfred Ugochukwu Achebe has given his blessings to the historic Onitsha City Marathon, which will hold on October 5. Organisers of the marathon will on Sunday meet with members of the Nigeria sporting press at the National Stadium, Surulere, Lagos. Head of Marketing and Branding of the Onitsha City Marathon, Chisom Okereke-Ekpe said yesterday that the event, which is the first international marathon in the South-East, would not be done without carrying the vibrant Lagos press along. “Lagos is the heart of sporting press in Africa and there is no way an event of this magnitude will take place without them. We know the importance of the Lagos sporting press and its environs, and that is why we have chosen to have this parley in order for all to be aware of what we are planning to do,” she said. According to Okereke-Ekpe, the maiden Onitsha City Marathon would only be half marathon, but subsequent ones will include both the 10km and 5km races. She said: “We are starting with just half marathon this year but from next year, it will definitely be bigger with the addition of the 10km and 5km races. “The race will start by 6.30am and registration is absolutely free for everyone capable and ready” According to the organisers, registration for the Onitsha City Marathon will run through till the end of September to allow for more participants. Over 20,000 runners from across the world are expected to take part in the race, which coincides with the popular Ofala Festival. The Onitsha City Marathon has secured the needed endorsements from all relevant professional bodies including the IAAF/AIMS following the expert touch by world-renowned Course measurer, Norrie Williamson from South Africa.
