 Manchester United’s Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku.  / AFP PHOTO / Fabrice COFFRINI  The Italian club have been chasing Lukaku during the transfer window and have reportedly returned with a fresh bid of around £65 million ($79 million) as they try and get the deal over the line. The Belgium striker has not played a single minute of United’s pre-season campaign and Conte is hopeful he can bring the 26-year-old to the San Siro. “We continue to work on it in the best possible way,” he said after his side drew 1-1 at Tottenham in a pre-season friendly on Sunday. “I understand there are some gaps that need to be filled but at the moment I am very hopeful that this will happen. “At the same time I’m working with a great group of players that gives me lots of satisfaction.” A complication to Inter’s chase of the former Everton striker is a reported swap deal between United and Juventus that could see Argentina attacker Paulo Dybala move to Old Trafford in exchange for Lukaku. “Honestly I can’t know, I don’t know,” the former Chelsea boss said. “I’m reading (about) this swap in the papers. “For sure Lukaku, we are talking about a good player, a striker that in the past I tried to buy when I was Chelsea’s coach. “We’re talking about two big clubs, Juventus and Inter Milan, but honestly I don’t know. Only my way is to work with this group of players, to try to improve this group and instil the right mentality.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
