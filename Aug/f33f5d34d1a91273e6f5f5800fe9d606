 SUNDAY DARE  Dare, who made the declaration during his inspection tour of the facility, promised to renovate the stadium’s pitch and other facilities to enable it host Super Eagles’ and other international matches. “I think what I have seen here is impressive. This facility is first class and Nigerians should be proud of it. What we intend to do is to bring it up to a 100 percent usage and capacity. There have been funding challenges, and I have just been sworn in as minister. I have been briefed, and we are going to be innovative in trying to see how we can get extra funding. “We are going to prioritise the football pitch. I don’t want to put a time frame to it, but it will be sufficient to say that it is right at the top of my agenda because we know it will take some time. Nigerians are interested and want Super Eagles matches to be played in Abuja, and the stadium will be ready soon,” Dare stated. Speaking further, the sports minster said: “I am looking at the pitch with a sense of revenue generating possibility, through advertising in line with other stadia all over the world, where different companies advertise. A lot of revenues can come from there. We are thinking outside the box. Dare stated categorically that the football pitch of the stadium would receive priority attention saying, “I’m going to be a minister for youth development and minister for sports development. I understand that soccer is loved by most Nigerians. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
