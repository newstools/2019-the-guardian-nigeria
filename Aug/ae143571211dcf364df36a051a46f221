Alongside Tracy Morgan, Wesley Snipes, Lesley Jones, Rick Ross and Kiki Layne are also among the new cast members in the return of the Eddie Murphy in the comedy sequel. Based on an original story by Eddie Murphy, the famed late ’80s culture comedy about an African prince scouting New York City for a wife was a box office hit: having grossed $128.1 million in the United States and $288.7 million worldwide. It turned out to be Paramount’s top earner of the year and the third highest-grossing film of 1988 in the U.S. behind Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Rain Man. However, the forthcoming sequel has a bit of twist to it; Akeem (Murphy) is set to become King of Zamunda but discovers he has a son he never knew about in America – a street-savvy Queens native named Lavelle. Honouring his father’s dying wish to groom this son as the crown prince, Akeem and Semmi (Arsenio Hall) set off to America to meet the unlikely heir. Other characters include Jones portraying the son’s mother, who had a one-night stand with Akeem. While Morgan plays Reem, a hustler who is Jones’  brother.
Also returning are James Earl Jones as Akeem’s father King Jake Joffer and Paul Bates as Akeem’s manservant Oha. Craig Brewer is directing the sequel with Murphy while Kevin Misher and Barris are producing. The sequel hits screens on December 18, 2020.
