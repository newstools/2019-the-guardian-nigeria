Rafael Nadal (Photo by Glyn KIRK / AFP) America’s teenage sensation, Coco Gauf continued her Cinderella debut with a 6/2; 4/6; 6/4 victory over Timea Babos of Hungary. In her career, the experienced 26-year old Timea had won 3 singles and 21 doubles titles on the WTA Tour. However, in the second round match in Louis Armstrong stadium, the 15-year old Coco was dominant in all aspects as she delivered 9 aces and won most points played after her first serve. The match would have been shorter had Coco converted more than four of the break chances she had. At the finish line, Coco had amassed a total of 101 points to Timea’s 86. The week of five-set marathons continued as South Korea’s Hyeon Chung recovered from two sets down to overcome Spain’s Fernando Verdasco 1/6; 2/6; 7/5; 6/3; 7/6. Alexander Bublik of Kazakhstan overcame Thomas Fabbiano of Italy 6/7; 5/7; 6/4; 6/3; 6/3. Fernando looked cruising to victory, as he led 5-2 in the final set. The Korean saved a match point in the 12th game before clinching the tie breaker 7 points to four. The 3 hours and 22 minute encounter was Chung’s second consecutive five-setter. The run is bound to take a toll Chung as he will face a fresh Nadal in the third round. Earlier in the day, Rafael Nadal’s smooth passage continued as he gained a walkover victory over Australia’s Thanasi Kokkinakis whose compatriot, Nick Kyrgios confidently dismissed Antoine Hoang of France, 6/4; 6/2; 6/4. In the first round, Nadal had rolled over Australia’s John Millman in straight sets while Kokkinakis, just recovering from injuries, outlasted Ilya Ivashka of Belarus, 6/3; 7/6(8); 6/7(4); 6/2 in the first round. Kyrgios had a weather-beaten opponent in Hoang who had survived a brutal five-set battle against Leonardo Mayer of Argentina 3/6; 6/2; 6/7; 6/1; 6/3. The Aussie star won the first two sets and secured an early break to lead 2-0. In the eighth game of the third set, Leonardo faced match point at 30-40 but forced a deuce. Kyrgios had another match point with the first advantage but Leonardo cancelled it and hung on to win the game. Serving for the match, Nick jumped to 30-0 but his opponent leveled at 30-all. It was a temporary delay, as the lanky Aussie blasted his 24th ace to reach match point and prevailed in a long rally to win the game and set 6-4.
