 Tax  This was the submission of participants at the end of a two-day stakeholders Forum on Tax and Gender Responsive Schools in Lagos organised by Human Development Initiative (HDI), Norad and Action Aid. The participants also implored the government to adopt equity in tax administration, rather than tax equality, which does not guarantee fairness and Justice in tax administration. They called on the government to increase budgetary allocation to the education sector, as well as building a strong evidence base to raise awareness for adequate Education Tax payment. The participants also demanded that public education system should be more responsive to all children, especially the girl-child and the marginalised, just as the government should upgrade public schools by providing adequate infrastructure and necessary resources for effective teaching and learning.
