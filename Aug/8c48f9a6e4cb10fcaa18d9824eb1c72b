Mophet Nigeria Limited, operators of a chain of pharmacies, has said it was investigating the sale of expired drugs at one of its outlets in Lagos. The promise was made after a viral video shows the Mophet Pharmacy at Adeola Odeku in Victoria Island, Lagos, had an expired mouthwash on sale. In the video, a customer was seen interrogating sales representative after he discovered the expiry date of some of the mouthwash was covered with fake stickers. “Look at this 2018…25/11/2018 covered with a sticker of 2019, the real expiry date is under them, very interesting,” the customer said  in the video. “This is very bad, it has nothing to do with notice. You can see 2018 at the back. This is the real expiry date 11, 2018 and 2019 is covered on all of them.” The company’s retail manager, Oluremi Oreagba in a statement on Wednesday expressed shock at the incident and vowed that no effort will be spared at getting to the root of the matter. “We regret the inconveniences and embarrassment caused our numerous customers and stakeholders,” Oreagba said in a statement on Wednesday. “In line with our commitment to safety and quality control, we immediately launched an investigation into the incident.” He further stated that following the incident the pharmacy has removed all products received from the supplier who supplied the controversial product from its store. Oreagba said the matter has been to some of the relevant government agencies, including the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), to get to the bottom of the matter. When the Guardian visited the pharmacy in Victoria Island, it was sealed with the presence of security stopping customers from getting inside the compound.
