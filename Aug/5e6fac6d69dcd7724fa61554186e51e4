This time, it is the official music video for “Home”, the current lead single off her trending fourth studio album “Woman of Steel”. Home is said to be taken from the short film inspired by the track, which also premiered on Friday evening at iMax Lekki Lagos during the “Woman of Steel” album listening event. Watch the video below:  It has been a year filled with activities and amazing lineups for Alade. In April, we got to watch her team up with Grammy-nominated rapper Rick Ross for the remix of her single “Oh My Gosh”. Still putting in the hard work and making major career moves, the sultry songstress was among the list of global artists selected to be featured on the Beyonce-curated and produced album “The Gift”  in July. Prior to Woman of Steel, we have witnessed Alade’s works beforehand – “Black Magic”, “Mama Africa”, and “King of Queens” which turned out to be many people’s favourite. Hopefully the new release will maintain that stance.
