This event witnessed a lot of big wigs in the society who are passionate about the issues raised in this movie. The 30-minute film focuses on the issue of ‘period poverty’ across poor communities in Africa, whereby girls and women cannot afford female sanitary products to deal with menstruation such as sanitary pads and tampons. It also delves into ancillary issues like institutionalized corruption in the armed forces, child labor, child marriage, pedophilia, rape and lack of access to quality education.
