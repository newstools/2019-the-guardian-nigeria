 Beyond vandalism, the oil and gas sector faces challenges on multiple fronts. Embracing artificial intelligence (AI) has been described as one of the measures to address them. How prepared is the Nigerian oil and gas industry for this innovation? FEMI ADEKOYA writes. Alongside volatile prices, new competitors emerging in the energy sector, and increasing global pressure from both public and private stakeholders around sustainability and environmental issues, the oil and gas sector needs to address peculiar challenges in their areas of operation with technology.
 
With global concerns heightened through several trade issues and sanctions, oil firms are beginning to explore modern technologies to maximize their efficiency and revenue.To some operators and industry observers, these challenges are all surmountable with the right approaches.
 
While the utilization of artificial intelligence has proved to be beneficial in several sectors such as healthcare, manufacturing, retail, and agriculture, the introduction of AI in oil and gas companies, might help the fortunes of the sector.  Enhancing efficiency and profitability
ON a return on asset (ROA) basis, oil and gas consistently under-performs. The EY noted that on a spectrum that ranges from the high teens (tobacco, railroads, and alcoholic beverages) to the low single digits (health care, consumer discretionary and financial) oil and gas has an ROA of around 7.5%.
  
Oil and gas (and other commodity industries with low ROA) companies are traditionally built on tangible assets like drilling rigs, pipes and refineries. Industries with high ROA are built on intangibles like brand and intellectual property.
  
“Oil and gas companies can change that equation.  They can bring more data and more sophisticated analysis to bear on their business, leveraging and extracting additional value from their assets — and AI can help”, EY added.
  
Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum Resources, Dr. Folasade Yemi-Esan, said in recent years, the industry has undergone rapid change, particularly with reference to the proliferation of new technologies by operators in order to meet the challenges of the emerging digital economy.She said there is a general slow pace with which the oil and gas industry is adapting technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), cloud computing and Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) for their operations and that is especially so in Nigeria.
  
According to her, the oil and gas industry needs to embrace digitalization to fast track the capacity and the potential of the industry by 2040.“On the part of the ministry, we are driving parastatals to ensure that we acquire reliable data and we are doing this through policy on transparency and efficiency. We are working with OPEC and back home, we are working with the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR),” she said.
 
She urged stakeholders to partner with the ministry and its agencies to enhance Nigeria’s capacity in the area of data development and management in the oil and gas industry.She added that awareness of Artificial Intelligence has consistently been on the rise since 2011 and its utilization has transformed several sectors such as health care, manufacturing, retail, telecommunication and agriculture, but however stated that its impact in the oil and gas industry is yet to match the aforementioned sectors.
