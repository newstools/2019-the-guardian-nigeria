The Oyo State Chapter of Nigeria Union of Pensioners (NUP), on Thursday, commended Gov. Seyi Makinde, over the prompt payment of Pensioners’ monthly allowance. Chairman of the chapter, Mr Olusegun Abatan, who spoke in a telephone interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), on Thursday, described the governor “as God-sent”. “I want to sincerely and most honestly tell you that we are indeed lucky to have Makinde as our governor. “Just as in his campaign slogan; `new dawn has arrived in Oyo State’, pensioners are happy, workers are happy, everybody is feeling the impact of Makinde’s administration. “Immediately after he was sworn-in, he dedicated his tenure salary to pensioners union, and he has not gone back on that promise as we get the alert of his monthly salary in the NUP account. “He promised us that workers and pensioners will always get their salaries and allowances on the 25th of every month and he has been good to his words. “Because 25th of this month fell on Sunday, Makinde paid workers and pensioners on Friday, 23rd, is he not God-sent? May God bless this man for us, he has put smiles back on our faces,” he said. Abatan also revealed that retired primary school teachers in the state now received their full salaries as against the part-payment received under the last administration. “Oyo State is a civil servants’ state, and we all depend on payment of salaries and allowances. “Because Seyi pays early, market women are happy, artisans are happy, everyone is happy; we pray he continues like this.’’ To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
