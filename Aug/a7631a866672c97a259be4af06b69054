 Speaker of Bauchi State House of Assembly, Abubakar Suleiman  At a two-day workshop on legislative duties for members of the state assembly organised by the state government, in collaboration with the National Institute for Legislative and Democracy Studies (NILDS) in Kano, Suleiman advised the lawmakers to put aside party differences. “It is worthy of note that our constituents have given us the mandate to represent them in the honourable house so that their yearnings would be taken care of by the government. This is a rare privilege. Thus, we should put the interests of our constituents above any other thing,” he said. In a statement by his media aide, Abdul Burra, the speaker tasked the lawmakers to discharge their legislative duties with all sense of responsibility and patriotism. His words, “Bauchi requires innovative legislative interventions to fast-track development in all ramifications.” He lauded his colleagues for seeing the end of the crisis that thwarted plenary for months, assuring them that he would run a transparent and inclusive administration. The Guardian gathered that the workshop, which was tagged ‘Good Governance Through Effective Legislative Engagement’, aimed at instilling patriotism and giving priority to constituencies, as well as to prepare the lawmakers for resumption from recess next week. “Upon resumption, the lawmakers are expected to screen the commissioner-nominees submitted to the house by Governor Bala Mohammed,” he added.
