A young man, simply identified as Ikechukwu yesterday evening reportedly committed suicide by jumping into an underground well and getting himself drowned. The incident happened at Umunogo Street, Achara layout, Amaokwe, in Enugu State. His mangled body was recovered yesterday evening by the state fire service officials. Eyewitnesses at the scene said they were shocked because the deceased was full of life and energy before his death. Some others told The Guardian they believed the handsome-looking fair-skinned young man may have taken the plunge to end his life due to frustration after falling on hard times, as he didnâ€™t have any history of mental illness. It was gathered the unmarried man had been out of job for sometime. He last worked with a private company before he was relieved of his duties a year ago, apparently due to the economic difficulties faced by his establishment. And since his disengagement, he had been jobless. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
