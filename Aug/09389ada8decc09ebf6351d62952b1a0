The Agricultural Transformation Agenda Support Programme Phase 1 (ATASP-1) funded by the African Development Bank (AfDB), may have injected about 209,464 metric tonnes of food valued at N36.2billion into the Nigerian economy in four years.
   
The Project that commenced in 2015, and implemented in seven  states of Jigawa, Anambra, Enugu, Niger, Kano, Jigawa and Kebbi was initially targeted to add 100,000mt of food to the nation’s food basket, but in its four years of implementation, has increased farmers’ income by 20.5 percent.
  
The National Programme Coordinator, Mohammad Arabi, who disclosed this at a news conference, yesterday, in Abuja, also said the project, which was funded to the tune of $174.85 million by AfDB, has created about 299,615 jobs.
