My family was always there behind me and now I’m back here. I’m very happy to play here, I just want to keep going.” Zouma has started the club’s first three games of the season and although he was below par in a 4-0 loss in the opening match with Manchester United, Lampard has shown faith in the 24-year-old Frenchman as the London side looks for its first win. “That’s what I wanted,” Zouma added. “I’m in a big club and everyone wants to play. “The competition is very hard and there are a lot of talented players, so when you train you to have to do it right. “There are players who came back, like me, and other players, the younger guys who came in. “Now we are starting to understand each other. We just need to be more clinical and get the wins.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
