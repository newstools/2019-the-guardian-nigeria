This is a great time for Nigerian music and most especially for Burna Boy, one of the most sought after Afrobeats artist. The self-acclaimed African Giant has been on a roll from his feature on Beyonce’s The Lion King: The Gift to his critically acclaimed album The African Giant. Burna Boy recently added another feather to his cap over the weekend when international singer and songwriter, Elton John endorsed him. The British legend gave Burna Boy a shout out on his Rocket Hour show on Beats 1 Radio by Apple Music. The jingle which was posted on Elton John’s twitter page said: “Elton has so much music to play on his #RocketHour today – @burnaboy, @africaexpress, @TEYANATAYLOR and more!

In what seems like disbelief the “Ye” crooner replayed the jingle a multiple times: “You dey see am    “ He captioned.   You dey see am     #burnaboy #eltonjohn #instagood #doubletap #london #canada #vvs #blow #dope #burnaboyworld A post shared by  Burna Boy's Only Official News (@burnaboyworld) on Aug 17, 2019 at 11:45pm PDT  This is coming after the BET award winner’s recent appearance on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah and earlier performance on Jimmy Kimmel Live. The career of international singer/songwriter and performer Elton John has spanned more than five decades. He is one of the top-selling solo artists of all time, with more than 250 million albums sold worldwide and the record for the biggest-selling single of all time, “Candle in the Wind.”
