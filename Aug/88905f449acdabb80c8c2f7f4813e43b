A Mapo Customary Court, Ibadan, on Friday sentenced a tenant, Mr John Joseph, to four days community service for disrespecting a court order to vacate a house. President of the court, Chief Ademola Odunade, in his ruling, held that Joseph’s action to ignore a court directive to vacate the house where he had been ejected, amounted to criminal contempt. “Joseph has shown to court that we have no legal right to order him out of the house which he is illegally occupying. “Therefore, Joseph shall serve four days community service by clearing the overgrown shrubs and grass within the court’s premises. “It is my hope that this punishment will serve as a deterrent to others who think that the customary court cannot punish them if they go against the law,” Odunade said. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the court had in May ordered Joseph and his wife to vacate the apartment which he rented from one Madam Monilara Akinade, over his inability to pay the house rent. After the court received a report that the defendant refused to move out, a warrant of arrest was issued against him.
