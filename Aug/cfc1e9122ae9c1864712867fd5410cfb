The Nigeria Scrabble Federation (NSF) has congratulated former Akwa Ibom State Governor, Senator Godswill Akpabio on his appointment as the Minister of Niger Delta. According to the federation, Senator Akpabio, who is currently the pillar of Pan Africa Scrabble Association and also the grand patron of the Nigeria Scrabble Federation, has over the years contributed to the growth of the sport in the country and sports development in general. Speaking on the appointment, national scrabble coach, Prince Tony Ikolo said Nigerian players and stakeholders of the game are delighted on the recent appointment, adding that Nigeria is currently ranked number one best scrabble country in the world after winning the 2015 edition of the World English Players Association Scrabble Championship (WESPAC). He said the feat would not have been achieved without Senator Akpabio’s support to the federation. Ikolo stated that Team Nigeria, which is currently preparing for the 2019 edition of the World English Players Association Scrabble Championship, was poised to defend the title in Goa, India by October. “The Nigeria Scrabble Federation and players are delighted by Akpabio’s appointment as the minister of Niger Delta. His contribution to the development of scrabble in Nigeria has helped to put Nigerian players on the world map. “Akpabio’s emphasis on ensuring that sports grow in every part of the country is commendable. His achievements as a governor and senator would also be replicated as a minister of Niger Delta. “Nigeria scrabble players are prepared to top defend their title at the World English Players Association Scrabble Championship in Goa, India from October 15 to 19,” he said. Ikolo called on the Federal, state, corporate organisations and well-meaning Nigerians to sponsor the cash-strapped scrabble team to the championship.
