Former governor of Sokoto State, Aliyu Magatakarda Wamako, has received approval from the Nigeria Universities Commission (NUC), to set up a private university. Wamako, who is currently a senator, said, “only qualitative education can guarantee development for the younger generation, thus, the drive for the establishment of a private university.”He further said: “There are no fewer than 80 private universities in Nigeria but there are only three in the northwest out of which only one is functional.”He said his desire for quality education led him to establish Sokoto State University and the same desire is leading him to establishing a private institution in the state.
