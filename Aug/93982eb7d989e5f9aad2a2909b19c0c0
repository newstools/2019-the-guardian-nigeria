 Barcelona’s Uruguayan forward Luis Suarez (L) celebrates after scoring a goal during the 54th Joan Gamper Trophy friendly football match between Barcelona and Arsenal at the Camp Nou stadium in Barcelona on August 4, 2019. Josep LAGO / AFP  Suarez flashed home Sergi Roberto’s lofted pass in the 89th minute in front of nearly 99,000 people, who packed the stands to see new signings Griezmann and Frenckie De Jong, with his strike and Ainsley Maitland-Niles’ comical own goal canceling out Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s fine first half opener. Barca are aiming for European glory this campaign after suffering Champions League humiliations against Roma and Liverpool the last two seasons. Before the match captain, Lionel Messi addressed those defeats — which saw Barca throw away comfortable first-leg leads before being dumped out — in a speech to the crowd. However, Messi didn’t take the field and it was left to his long-time strike partner rather than the new boys to see off the Gunners after a powerful second half display.
