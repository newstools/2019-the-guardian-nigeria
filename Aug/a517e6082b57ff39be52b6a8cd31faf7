Jeuene Afrique reported that the artiste died following a road accident that occurred in the night of Sunday 11 in Abidjan. DJ Arafat suffered a fractured skull after his motorcycle collided with a car on Sunday night and was subsequently admitted to hospital in the main city, Abidjan but he did not survive. “He was admitted to the emergency room in a vegetative state. He had a skull fracture and oedema,” a doctor from the institution told Jeune Afrique, on condition of anonymity. The medical teams tried to revive him, “in vain”. Ivory Coast Culture Minister Maurice Kouakou Bandaman has expressed his condolences in a statement and said a tribute would be organised to honour the musician. DJ Arafat is regarded as the king of  Coupé-Décalé; a type of popular dance music originating from Côte d’Ivoire and the Ivorian diaspora in Paris, France. The genre is a very percussive style featuring African samples, deep bass, and repetitive minimalist arrangements. DJ Arafat was named the best artist of the year at the Coupé-Decalé Awards in 2016 and 2017. One of his biggest hit songs, Dosabado, has over five million views on YouTube.
