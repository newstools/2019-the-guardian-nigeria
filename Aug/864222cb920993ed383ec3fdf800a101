I really think a lot of teams have a good chance.” Liverpool is among the top seeds in Pot One along with Chelsea, Barcelona, Manchester City, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Paris St Germain and Zenit St Petersburg for the Champions’ League group stage draw, which takes place later on Thursday. The quality of teams in the second pot, which includes Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Borussia Dortmund has convinced Klopp there is no need to change the format of the competition when the current cycle ends in 2024. “I don’t think there was ever a stronger Pot Two. It is just crazy,” the German added. “They should all be in Pot One, but there is not enough space there. “I don’t think there was ever a stronger Pot Three. If people really think about this kind of Super League, then you don’t need it. That’s it. Then Pot Four you can get RB Leipzig.’’ Klopp expects Liverpool to face stiff competition from a number of heavyweights as they bid for a seventh European crown. While Juventus, Barcelona, PSG and Dortmund looked to fine-tune their squads in the transfer market, Real Madrid and Bayern have recruited heavily. “Look at the squad Borussia Dortmund has and tell me we are stronger than them. That is incredible,” Klopp added. “There are a lot of quality teams: Juventus will be there, PSG will be there. Real Madrid? Do you think they gave up already? “Bayern Munich also brought in (Ivan) Perisic and (Philippe) Coutinho which is a big boost.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
