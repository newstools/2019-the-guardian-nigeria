The Ojude Oba, which in Ijebu dialect means, “the king’s forecourt or frontage”, is a major festival in Nigeria that began over 100 years ago and brings together all sons and daughters of Ijebuland in Nigeria and Diaspora. At a press conference on July 29, at Ijebu-Ode, to announce the kick-off of this year’s edition, FCMB reiterated its commitment to support activities that promote and add value to Nigeria’s culture and heritage, which are also capable of boosting tourism, trade and the hospitality sector. The Founder of FCMB Group, who is also the Olori Omo-Oba Akile Ijebu, Otunba Olasubomi Balogun, has expressed his gratitude to the paramount ruler for his selflessness, distinguished and exemplary leadership for the 59 years he has been the paramount ruler of Ijebuland, which makes him one of the longest reigning monarchs in Nigeria. “As your children and subjects, the period provides us the platform, and the opportunity to pay you homage in demonstration of our affection for a very special and exceptional Father. Also, the Group Chief Executive of FCMB Group, Ladi Balogun, congratulated the monarch for upholding the values of Ijebuland and raising the status of the event over the years. “The Ojude Oba Festival is a rallying point to promote the sustainable growth and development of our community. We recognise that celebrating our heritage is an important part of our national identity, a means of educating visitors and future generations about our history and an opportunity to measure our growth, development and sustainability.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
