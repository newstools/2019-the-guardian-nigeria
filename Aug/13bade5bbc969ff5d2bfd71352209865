Apple TV+ has released the first official teaser trailer of The Morning Show. The Morning Show stars Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell and it takes a look at the lives of the people who deliver the news to viewers at the start of each new day. Aniston and Witherspoon are also involved as executive producers. The upcoming series, which has already been given an order for two seasons, is among the most high-profile offerings of Apple TV+. It will mark Aniston’s first role as a series regular since Friends ended in 2004. The Morning Show looks to be a blend of the serious and the salacious, drawing on the many instances of reported backstabbing and politicking that occur among the seemingly amiable crew of a morning news program.
