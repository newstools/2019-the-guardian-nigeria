According to Udeze, the match in Kyiv would give Rohr more insight into the strengths and weaknesses of his emerging team, adding that it would also put the players in top shape for the forthcoming World Cup and Nations Cup qualifiers. He advised the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to keep organising quality tune-up matches for the Super Eagles, saying that it would go a long way to make the team more solid and organised. “I believe the coach most understand that winning the game is not a do or die affair. He should try out the newly invited players and also try as much as possible to build love and the spirit of commitment on the players. “After playing in the 2019 African Nations Cup, the Super Eagles need tune-up matches to remain cohesive. “Ukraine for me is not a small team in world football, and I believe the Eagles would have a tough game. But it is important for the NFF to organise more friendlies with tougher opponents to help the Super Eagles’ building process,” he said.
