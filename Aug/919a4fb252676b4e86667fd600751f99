Lagos lawyer and activist, Mr. Osita Enwe, has called on the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency (LASEPA) to prosecute two Chinese illegal immigrants who allegedly operated an e-waste factory at No. 19, Sule Abuka Street, Lagos.
  
While commending the agency for arresting the suspects as reported by The Guardian, the lawyer said it should deploy all its human and material resources to work with the Nigerian Police, together with the Lagos State Ministry of Justice to ensure that Messrs Lin Piehao and Li Ruoneng are effectively prosecuted for all their alleged activities.
  
“You will by this gesture deepen your commitment to improve and protect the environment thereby actualizing your constitutional obligations of safeguarding the water, air, land, forest and wild life for the sake of Lagosians.  It would be recalled that last week, the police arrested the duo of Lin Piehao, 22, and Li Ruoneng, 27, in Lagos for allegedly operating an illegal e-waste factory said to be emitting toxic waste into the environment. The suspects were arrested on Monday night at the factory by a team led by the Commander Area ‘F’, Akinsoji Adebayo, an Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP). It was gathered that the suspects, whose visas had expired, usually assembled the e-waste mainly from mobile phones and tablets, which they exported to China and Vietnam through air cargo. The police team, it was learnt, intercepted several cartons of the toxic materials at the factory that had no name. Barely 48 hours later, LASEPA sprung into action by sealing two illegal e-waste factories, including that of the two Chinese said to have emitted toxic substances in Ikeja. The factories, located at 19, Sule Abuka, Street, Opebi, Lagos and 15, Adekunle Fajuyi Street, GRA, Ikeja were said to be owned and managed by Chinese.
