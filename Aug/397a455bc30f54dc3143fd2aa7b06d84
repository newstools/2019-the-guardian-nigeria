A military flight instructor was presumed dead after his plane crashed on Monday at sea off the southeastern coast of Spain, the air force said. The C-101 -- the same aircraft used by Spain's air force Eagle Patrol aerobatics team -- was on a training flight when it crashed near the resort of La Manga, the defence ministry said. On board was a flight instructor who "was able to eject before the plane crashed in the sea". But in a tweet, the air force said "everything indicates that our colleague... has died," saying "remains" had been found that needed to be examined by forensics. A video filmed by a witness and posted on Twitter shows a small aircraft falling at a near vertical before trying to straighten up and hurtling into the water. Emergency services said a search and rescue mission had been set up which includes the air force, navy, firefighters and coastguards.
