•Partners NSCDC on safety of oil assets In efforts to rid the nation of the menace of pipeline vandalism, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), yesterday, disclosed that a new performance-based pipeline protection system is being considered to address the situation.The approach, according to the Corporation will  enable relevant security stakeholders to live up to their expectations on protecting oil infrastructure. NNPC also said the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) have pledged to work together to run pipeline vandals and oil thieves out of business in the country. A statement from the Group spokesman, Ndu Ughamadu, said the two organisations made the commitment when the Group Managing Director of NNPC, Mele Kyari, received the Commandant General of the Corps, Abdullahi Muhammadu, at the NNPC Towers in Abuja.
Kyari, who was represented by the Chief Operating Officer, Downstream, Adeyemi Adetunji, noted that collaboration between the parties had gone a long way in ensuring uninterrupted supply and distribution of petroleum products through the pipelines and various depots.
  
“I want to applaud the NSCDC for contributing their quota towards protection and security of our pipelines. Their efforts have made our pipelines to be available for the transportation of petroleum products from one asset to another petroleum asset,” Kyari was quoted.
 
Earlier, Muhammadu, represented by Deputy Commandant General, Aminu Abdullahi, said protection and security of NNPC pipelines and oil assets were part of the constitutional responsibilities of the Corps, stressing that NSCDC would continue to do its best to send pipeline vandals out of business.He noted that the NSCDC would declare a date of the year that would soon be announced as an anti-pipeline vandalism day, as part of efforts to create more awareness on the dangers of pipeline vandalism to the national economy.
