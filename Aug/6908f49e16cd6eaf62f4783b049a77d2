Stating that all religions preach peace and harmony, he stressed that anyone who kills or destroys in the name of Islam or any other religion was either ignorant or do not understand religion. “Islam forbids killing, kidnapping, and destruction in any form. If anybody says Allahu Akbar and kills somebody, he does not understand Islam. Islam is a religion of peace and all Nigerians must learn to live in peace and create a peaceful environment,” he stated.
