 Inspector General of Police, Abubakar Adamu; Director General. 						                                               PHOTO: PHILIP OJISUA  While information about the death of the officer, renowned for his gallantry in the anti-kidnapping unit of the Aba Area Command, remained sketchy, it was gathered that the kidnapper, whose name was yet to be ascertained was also killed in the crossfire.The deceased cop, an indigene of Akwa Ibom State, was the driver of his squad unit that went after a notorious kidnapper at the Osisioma axis of the commercial city following a tip off that their target was at home. While some eyewitnesses said the police officer was shot on the neck while he tried to peep through the window of the house they had surrounded, another version of the story said he was shot by the kidnapper while he was trying to gain entrance into the house with other members of the squad to effect the suspect’s arrest. A source, who said he saw the deceased officer on Tuesday night when they carried out the operation, described the deceased as a fine police officer who was loved by people in and around the police barracks. The source stated that the members of the Udobat’s squad fought hard to keep him alive but lost their colleague because he lost excess blood at the scene of the incident. When newsmen visited the Aba Area Command, mourning and gloom enveloped the area as everyone was seen discussing the death of the officer in hushed tones, whom many described as a good man.It was gathered that Udobat, who is survived by his wife and four children, recently dedicated his newborn baby before his untimely demise. The Police Public Relations Officer for Abia State Command could not be reached for comments on the incident as at press time. Meanwhile, two persons including a policeman have been killed by unknown gunmen in separate attacks that occurred in Takum and Wukari local councils of Taraba State. Confirming the report, the chairmen of both local councils called on the federal and state government to intensify security in the southern parts of the state, which is presently prone to insecurity. The attacks, which occurred yesterday, led to the killing of a policeman and a truck driver of Dangote Cement whom The Guardian learnt was conveying cement to Jalingo, the state capital. While the attack on the truck driver was said to have occurred in Yoina village of Wukari, the attack on the police sergeant, whose name was given as Mohammad Abdullahi, took place at Kufai Ahmadu in Takum local council. The caretaker chairman of Wukari, Adi Daniel, said attacks on the council have become a daily occurrence. He therefore called for more security operatives, especially the police and army to have a visible presence in the area. On his part, the Takum caretaker chairman, who said the deceased policeman was attacked at the same spot where he (Tikari) narrowly escaped gunmen attack on August 7, said three vehicles were attacked along Kufai-Amadu road to Takum. He said: “A bus was being attacked by the militias who came out from the bush in large numbers and shot at the driver leaving him badly injured when unfortunately, the policeman ran into the suspected gunmen.” When contacted for reaction, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), David Misal, said they were not aware of the attacks yet but promised to get back to our correspondent as soon as the information gets to the police command.
