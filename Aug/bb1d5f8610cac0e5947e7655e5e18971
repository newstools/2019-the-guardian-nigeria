Adesanya, who hails from Odogbolu, Ogun State, said he started Mixed Martial Arts as a way of defending himself some years ago, adding: “Now, I don’t entertain any fear whenever I step into the ring. Fear is not a factor. It is just an illusion, but you have to be wary of the danger anytime you are in the ring fighting. In the fifth round of my last fight against Kelvin Gastelum, I told myself I am ready to die, which means, I was prepared to kill. We are all human animalss, but only a few people can tap into what they have up stirred,” Adesanya stated. He hinted that he had since commenced intensive training ahead of his fight against Whittaker, who failed to defend his middleweight title against Kelvin Gastelum in February after he was forced to undergo emergency dual surgery due to an abdominal hernia of the intestine and a twisted and collapsed bowel. “I am in my fifth week of training for the fight, and I know I will floor him,” Adesanya stated. The showdown between Adesanya and Robert Whittaker will hold at Marvel Stadium in Melbourne on October 6. When Adesanya visited Nigeria in May this year, 16 years after he took his martial arts business to New Zealand, he told The Guardian that he would do everything possible to defeat Robert Whittaker for the UFC middleweight title whenever the fight comes up.
