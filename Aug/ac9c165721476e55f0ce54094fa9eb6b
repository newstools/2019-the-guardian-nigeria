Workers of Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital (ISTH) in Esan Central Local Council of Edo State yesterday protested the abduction of Chief Medical Director of the hospital, Prof. Sylvanus Okogbenin, by gunmen. The members of staff, under the umbrella of Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU), who marched through the streets of Irrua calling for the immediate and unconditional release of their boss unhurt, stopped over at the palace of the Onogie of Irrua, the Police Divisional Headquarters in Irrua and the Irrua Main Market to express their worry over the incident as well as their safety. Activities at the hospital were consequently at the lowest ebb as most workers were not at their duty posts to attend to patients following the protest. JOHESU Chairman, ISTH Chapter, Alabi Precious, who spoke on behalf of the protesting workers, urged security agencies, particularly the office of the Inspector-General of Police, the Department of State Services (DSS) and other relevant security agencies to ensure the release of the CMD and also the arrest of those behind the gruesome act. He said two directors in the administrative department of the hospital were similarly kidnapped last week along with their drivers on their way back from Asaba where they had gone for a workshop, adding that no sooner had they been released, than the CMD was kidnapped.
