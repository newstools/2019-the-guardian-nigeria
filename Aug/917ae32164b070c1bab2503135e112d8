 Lawan. Photo: TWITTER/SPNigeria  Speaking to newsmen yesterday, the central coordinator, Hashimu Pali, questioned the position of the Senate on the crisis that led to the emergence of a factional speaker, asserting that it breached the law since the case was already before a court of law. Pali urged the Senate and the House of Representatives to dialogue with members of the Bauchi legislature to resolve the predicament once and for all. He said: “In the first place, the inauguration that brought about the speaker and deputy speaker of Bauchi State House of Assembly is valid in law because with 13 members present at the chamber that day, a quorum was formed. There can’t be two speakers because while the legitimate group held its inauguration with the mace inside the assembly complex, the other group was outside the complex without the mace. “We urge the Senate not to concur with the House of Representatives is threatening to take over the assembly, more so now that the misunderstanding between the house members has been settled and the rest of them have been inaugurated. In any event, the National Assembly should obey court order and not exceed its powers.” The group further called on the governor and the assembly to work together to give their constituencies democracy dividends. Eighteen aggrieved members of the house were inaugurated last Friday night at a special session presided over by the deputy speaker, Ahmed Kawule. The crisis, according to Governor Bala Mohammed, was settled through the intervention of stakeholders, including traditional rulers.
