Also speaking, Lagos Zonal Co-ordinator, NHIS, Olufemi Akingbade, said most of the laws in Nigeria on healthcare financing were not workable, noting that they have hindered the achievement of the Universal Health Coverage (UHC).He said lack of financial mechanism to protect the health of the citizens and optional health insurance scheme had limited the progress of achieving the UHC. In the same vein, President, Health Federation of Nigeria, Clare Omatseye, said Nigerians should charge politicians to ensure health insurance bill is signed and implemented.   She said only five per cent of the nation’s budget was allocated to health, noting that there should be provision for ‘catastrophe health fund’ to provide finances for medical equipment, infrastructure and others.
