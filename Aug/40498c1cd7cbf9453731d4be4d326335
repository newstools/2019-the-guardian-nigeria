The police on Friday in Lagos arraigned two employees of the Dangote Oil Refining Company Ltd., who allegedly stole iron rods worth N1 million from the company. The truck drivers –  Ibrahim Madaki, 20, and Mohammed Nuru, 25 – appeared before a Tinubu Magistrates’ Court on a two-count charge of conspiracy and theft. The duo, however, pleaded innocent of the offences. The Prosecutor, Insp. Ajaga Agboko, said  that they committed the offences on Aug. 7, at the company’s premises at Ibeju-Lekki, Lagos. He said that the drivers stole 410 pieces of iron rods and were caught by two security guards after they had loaded the rods in a truck and were about to drive out in the middle of night.
