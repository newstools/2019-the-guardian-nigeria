The Federal Government has warned Nigerians against feasting on rare species like the whale, which was washed ashore in Ijaw kiri community waterfront of Brass Local Government, Bayelsa State. Conservator-General, National Park Service, Ibrahim Musa Goni who gave the warning said cannibalisation of the whale was dangerous, calling for a process of evacuation. Goni also frowned at the way and manner the communities feasted on the aquatic animal, urging relevant government agencies to cordon off the area, if it is still alive and healthy. He lamented that the 30 feet Whale is rare specie that is gradually going extinct. “The global acceptable practice is to call the appropriate authorities to assess the condition of the helpless Whale, and help it back into its natural habitat. Goni pledged to support National Environmental Standards and Regulation Enforcement Agency (NESREA) if required in the sanitation that will help forestall future stranded animals.
