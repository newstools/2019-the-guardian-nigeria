Biafra Zionists Federation (BZF) has criticised the police for cordoning off strategic public places in Enugu State to prevent the inauguration of its leaders, the leader, Benjamin Onwuka, stated yesterday. Onwuka had few weeks back announced that he would be inaugurated as Biafra president on Tuesday, July 30, at the Michael Okpara Square, Enugu. He capped it up by releasing a list of ministerial nominees. However, the police took over strategic locations in the state to stop Onwuka and his group from carrying out their plans. Apart from Okpara Square, the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium, among other places, were cordoned off by the police. In the speech circulated to journalists, Onwuka described the lockdown as an exercise in futility and act of cowardice, since he has been successfully inaugurated as president of Biafra. He said: “This is to inform the entire world that I, Benjamin Igwe Onwuka, has been sworn in as the president of the Republic of Biafra,” he claimed in his speech. He accused President Muhammadu Buhari of encircling Enugu with heavy security to stop the swearing-in. “But we had a successful swearing-in in Enugu at the full glare of his desperate security men. Despite the lockdown of Enugu, we achieved it. “It was a futile attempt and act of cowardice to barricade public places just to stop the Zionists, but they failed. We succeeded because of the full diplomatic support of the United States of America.” “Okpara Square and other parts of Enugu were surrounded with heavy security, but Buhari and his men failed to stop the swearing-in of Zionists leader, Onwuka, as Biafra president. “They knew where we were; they surrounded us, but could not come close. Before morning, they surrounded the whole of Okpara Square. They even used helicopter and satellite to be monitoring where we were in Owerri Road, but we persisted that it must take place. “All they wanted on Tuesday was for the announcement not to take place, so we changed tactics by saying that it was more important for our inauguration to take place than having physical confrontation with them, which could have led to so many things. “It is for this reason that we left Okpara Square for them. Our members came from all over the place with buses; it was not a secret event.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
