Men from the Ogun State police command have arrested two suspects for allegedly killing a yet-to-be-identified motorcyclist. The suspects, Lekan Odusote, 27 and Monday John, 22, according to the police, lured the victim to Ikangba, Obalende area in Ijebu-Ode, murdered him and took away his bike. They allegedly took his body to an uncompleted building, dug a shallow grave and buried him there. The command’s spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, in a statement in Abeokuta yesterday said: “Having murdered him, they took his motorcycle to Ijebu-Igbo where they sold it for N120,000. “Luck however ran against them when they were about to share the money because of their inability to agree on a particular sharing formula. This led to a serious altercation between them as some of their pronouncements arouse the suspicion of people around who informed the police. “Upon receiving the information, the DPO, Obalende division, Sunday Omonijo, swiftly dispatched his detectives to effect the arrest of the two suspects. On interrogation, they confessed to luring an Okada man to an isolated area where they killed him and took possession of the motorcycle which they sold,” the statement indicated. Oyeyemi disclosed “The suspects have taken police to the uncompleted building where the victim was buried, and the body has been recovered and taken to mortuary for post mortem examination.” Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, Bashir Makama, has ordered the immediate transfer of the suspects to Homicide Section of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for further investigation and prosecution.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
