A non-governmental organization, Chinwe Bode-Akinwande (CBA) Foundation, has rekindled the hopes of hundreds of indigent widows within Okun-Ilado community of Ibeju-Lekki, Lagos State by empowering them with business grants, food items, clothing, free medical treatment and scholarships for their children.
   
According to the organisation, the initiative, which was supported by First Bank of Nigeria, is in commemoration of the 2019 United Nations’ International Widows’ Day. Speaking at the event, founder of the foundation, Mrs. Chinwe Bode-Akingbade, said the gesture was to uplift the pitiable conditions of widows and less privileged in the society, as well as boosting their confidence. She called on the government to implement and enforce the Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act (VAPP), which gives protection to widows in the country, stressing that the government needs to create more awareness about the act for widows to know their rights and also for people to thread with caution. “I have friends who are victims and I can tell you, the dehumanization and injustice meted to widows in the country is unimaginable, hence, I decided to contribute my little quota as a selfless act to alleviate their pains. As I speak, we currently have over 600 widows on our profile, and the children of about 90 per cent of them have dropped out of school because of lack of funds. So, even if it is the basic education we are able to give to them, they can build on it.”
  
Reacting, the Baale of the community, Chief Ologbon Oladehinde Oloye, said the gesture would go a long way in salvaging the wretched situation of widows in the community, as poverty, hunger and malnutrition are great threats to their livelihood.
