Multiple award-winning film star, Juliet Ibrahim has starred as different characters in several films but one thing fans should not be expected of her is to act nude or semi-nude in an African film. The Ghanaian beauty who made an appearance on Accra 100.5FM revealed during an interview that acting in the nude or semi-nude will only happen if she has to act in a Hollywood flick. According to the screen star, she has turned down several African film producers with nude scenes in their script. She said: “If I’m called up for a movie in Hollywood and I’m supposed to expose parts of my body and it is going to be done tastefully or even with body doubles because we always have stunt models and body doubles in Hollywood, I would.” She further added that the film industry in Ghana doesn’t have the sophistication of Hollywood so she usually turns down such films. She, however, admitted that she has played some love scenes in the past where she had to show off some part of her body. She said: “I had probably had to reveal some parts of my boobs but it was sides and stuff but it was done tastefully, I was wearing a bra but you will not know.” Juliet-Ibrahim The actress concluded her interview by revealing that featuring in a film with award-winning American actor and filmmaker Tyler Perry, will be a dream come true for her. Some few days ago, Ibrahim’s ex-boyfriend, Nigerian rapper Iceberg Slim took to social media to publicly apologise to her for cheating on her during their relationship and also disrespecting her. According to him, he is making the apology public because it is sometimes necessary to help the healing process.
