   “When I was in Sweden, I would listen to the radio, and I would hear my brother Ferg’s song, I wanna hear that song now!” Rocky demanded as Ferg graced the stage for his new single and a blend of collaborative, fan-favorite works including “Work,” “Plain Jane,” “No Limit,” and more. According to Billboard, just before performing his final songs, Rocky thanked his supporters once more, opening up about his legal issues, “I’m so happy to be here. I know y’all was praying for me, I’m not guilty ’n shit, but I’ll need y’all to keep praying for me. I get the verdict on Wednesday, hopefully I don’t go back to jail,” he continued, clarifying, “I got nothing against Swedish people. When I was locked up, it was Swedish people protesting outside the jails for me, standing up for me.”
