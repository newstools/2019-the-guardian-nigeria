Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa has advocated greater collaboration between the federal and state governments to attract positive development, stressing that this would ensure sustainable and meaningful change at the grassroots level. Okowa stated this while commissioning the Goldcoast Memorial Market in Tori Urua, Sagbama Local Government Area of Bayelsa State, built-in memory of Governor of Bayelsa State, Seriake Dickson’s mother, the late Goldcoast Dickson. The commissioning exercise, which was witnessed by Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Social Investments, Maryam Uwais, among other dignitaries, coincided with the one-year memorial anniversary of Goldcoast Dickson, who hailed from Delta State. Governor Dickson said he was spurred to construct a series of projects, especially granting his mother’s request to build the market following his invitation by Okowa to commission projects in Delta State.
