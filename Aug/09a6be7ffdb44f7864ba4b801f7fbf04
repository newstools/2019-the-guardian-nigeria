British singer Jorja Smith has dropped the video to the much talked about collaboration, Be Honest, with Nigeria’s very own, Burna Boy. The Izy and Cadenza-produced song mark Smith and Burna Boy’s second collaboration; she previously appeared on “Gum Body” from his most recent album African Giant. Shot across various prime London locations, including Rye Lane Market and Peckham Liberal Club, the retro-inspired video features break-ins at the neighbourhood pool, jet-ski drifting, and cameos from Smith’s real-life friends.  Judging by the outcome of Burna Boy’s collaborations with women, it wasn’t difficult to expect a fantastic delivery by the African Giant just as we’ve heard previously on Lily Allen’s “Your Choice” and Mahalia’s “Simmer”. Also, the duo’s initial sultry collaboration “Gum Body” already showed how well he works with Jorja Smith, and that made us get off the fence. Burna Boy is deservedly having his moment right now, as he continues to rise globally — specifically in America and the UK; we anticipate more collaborations.
