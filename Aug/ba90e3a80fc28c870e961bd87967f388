 Enyimba players celebrate their passage to the last qualifying round of the CAF Champions League after beating Rahimo of Burkina Faso 5-0…yesterday.  The Burkinabe champions were reduced to 10 men nine minutes after the kick off when their first leg goal scorer, Zonon Issouf was given a straight red card for stamping on Enyimba’s Emmanuel Ampia. Although what would have been Enyimba’s opening goal by Skipper Godwin Abalogu in the 24th minute was cancelled as Stanley Dimgba, who provided the assist, was ruled offside, the People’s Elephant moved ahead in the 30th minute through Reuben Bala’s fantastic free kick. Enyimba weathered a scare in the 38th minute when defender Nelson Ogbonnaya inexplicably allowed Cisse Mody the opportunity to come face to face with goalkeeper Theophilus Afelokhai. But the Super Eagles’ alternate goalkeeper was equal to the task as he pushed Mody’s shot over the bar. The fight in Rahimo FC was snuffed off in the second half by the introduction of Stanley Okorom in place of Emmanuel Ampia. The former MFM FC star made an immediate impact as he gave Enyimba the lead on aggregate in the
46th minute. Stanley Dimgba made scores 3-0 on the night in the 78th minute; Reuben Bala scored the fourth goal shortly after, before Dimgba completed his brace off a pass from the corner flank by Stanley Okorom. Enyimba will now meet Al Hilal of Sudan in the last qualifying round of the competition.The Sudanese team were held to a goalless draw by Rayon Sport of Rwanda and thus qualify on the away goals rule as their first leg ended 1-1 in Kigali two weeks ago.
