Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr has invited two new players for the friendly against Ukraine in September. Rohr announced his list of 23 players including 18 players from the team that finished third at the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. Goalkeeper Maduka Okoye and midfielder Joe Aribo were handed first-time invitations to play for the Super Eagles in the forthcoming friendly. German-born Okoye had openly stated his commitment to play for Nigeria before he was given a call-up to Nigeria’s U23 team. With Rohr inviting just three goalkeepers including Ikechukwu Ezenwa and Francis Uzoho, the Fortuna Düsseldorf II keeper seems to have knocked Daniel Akpeyi off the list. Following the retirement of John Mikel Obi and Odion Ighalo, Gernot Rohr has invited new faces into the team with the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers set to commence.
