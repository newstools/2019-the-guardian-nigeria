 Prince Dapo Abiodun of Ogun state. Photo/Twitter/dabiodunMFR  Gov. Dapo Abiodun, according to a statement issued in Abeokuta on Friday by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Kunle Somorin, made this public on Friday, saying the measure would enhance economic activities in the state. The roads, according to Abiodun, are the Ikorodu – Ogijo – Shagamu, the Epe – Ijebu/Ode and the Lagos – Ota – Abeokua. He stated that the state government was already seeking permission and support of the Federal Government and the World Bank over the matter. Abiodun, according to the statement, had noted that the Lagos – Ota – Abeokuta road had remained a gory sight, particularly whenever it rains resulting in hardship for Ogun residents who need to commute to and from Lagos State. “People who shuttle through Iyana / Ilogbo axis of the road often talk about the nightmare they encounter every day because of potholes and endless gridlock. “This is a road under the fourth addendum and requires about N26 billion for complete rehabilitation. ” As a responsible government, we cannot fold our arms while our people suffer,” the statement quoted Abiodun as saying. The governor explained further that the Epe – Ijebu/ Ode and the Ikorodu – Ogijo roads required similar intervention. He noted that Lagos State had completed its own end of the Epe- – Ijebu/Ode road. “What we need to make it a total package is about 14.4km stretch. “So, we are taking it over because the welfare of our people is paramount to us. ” When completed, it will become an alternative route to motorists going to the Eastern part of the country,” he said.
