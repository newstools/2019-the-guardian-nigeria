Stakeholders in agriculture, including the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) through its Yam Improvement for Income and Food Security in West Africa research project (YIIFSWA II), on Saturday, harped on modern techniques to improve yam production in the country. Focal Person, Advocacy and Resource Mobilisation, YIIFSWA II, Dr. Iyere-Usiahon Perpetual, emphasised techniques to improve yam for better economic benefits. Iyere-Usiahon, while addressing journalists during a one-day advocacy forum on sustainable high quality seed yam production for wealth creation and empowerment in Benin, in collaboration with Root and Tuber Division of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, said there was need for quality seed yam production techniques. Iyere-Usiahon said YIIFSWA II was committed to ensuring sustainable high quality seed yam by empowering smallholder producers with improved varieties and seeds developed by the IITA-led YIIFSWA II research project. Explaining the essence of the advocacy on quality seed yam production, Iyere-Usiahon said it was to create awareness of the economic impact of the yam sector for increased investment and prioritization, as well as empower women to actively participate in the commercial yam seed value chain within the context of the appropriate socio-cultural system.
