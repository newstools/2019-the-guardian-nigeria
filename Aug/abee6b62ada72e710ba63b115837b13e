The Federal Government and British Geological Survey have concluded plans to retrieve about 7,000 missing colonial geological reports, needed for adequate archiving in the mining industry. Recall that former Minister, Dr Kayode Fayemi, had visited the British Geological Survey to request the recovery of the geological reports on the mineral potential in Nigeria. Project Coordinator, Mineral Sector Support For Economic Diversification Project (MinDiver), Linus Adie, when British team visited him in Abuja, noted that the Nigeria Geological Survey Agency (NGSA), had over the years been requesting the release of the reports.

He also said the data have been coming in bits, and when they arrive, they get missing due to lack of reliable archiving system, and they have decided to build a digital National Geo-data Centre. Adie, equally explained that the retrieved colonial reports would enable the Ministry digitalise and archive them for NGSA, and the National Steel, Raw Material Exploration Agency Kaduna, (NSRMEA).
