With major hits  back to back on his critically acclaimed album, “African Giant,” Burna Boy releases the video for his 5th single off the album, “Pull Up.” The video was shot by filmmaker, Meji Alabi, who is responsible for the hit music videos like “Fever” by Wizkid featuring Tiwa Savage. In the video, Burna Boy croons softly around these women in bright yellow outfits signifying the positivity, clarity, and loyalty for his woman that he sings about in this laid back song. The themes of the video convey messages of living life stress-free, “loving the vibe” and enjoying every moment you get to spend with your friends, lovers, and family.  Last month, the “Ye” crooner made a major addition to the feathers on his cap, all thanks to his feature on the Beyonce-curated and produced album “The Lion King: The Gift”, an ode to Disney’s live-action remake of the 1994 animated classic, was released in the early hours of today. His feature “Ja Ara E” which means to wise up was widely accepted by fans in Nigeria and across borders. Following the success of this track, he dropped his highly anticipated album ‘African Giant’ which pushed him further under everyone’s radar, from Jimmy Kimmel to Trevor Noah, as well as GQ. We hope to see more greatness from Burna Boy for as long as possible.
