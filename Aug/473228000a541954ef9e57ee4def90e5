This is what Tanta Secure is addressing.
 
Vice-Chairman of Tanta Secure, John Mark Ossai, said: “There are over 4000 unlicensed technicians all over Lagos. Repairing your item with an unlicensed technician, whom you cannot identify by requesting to see their license before working with them, is a major risk and could reduce the life span of your items.
  
“The target of an unlicensed technician is to get your device working at all cost, ignoring important technical procedures for their financial benefits. But in the tech world, each component relies on other components to function properly. We ensure that qualified technicians handle your devices.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
