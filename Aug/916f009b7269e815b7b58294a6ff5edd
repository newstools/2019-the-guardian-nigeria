From her untimely exit from the Big Brother House, Avala (which means “warrior” in Old Sanskrit) has been putting in the work -collaborating on projects, making appearances among other activities. It is safe to say that these new experiences have reshaped the once shy and quiet girl into the sexy, thriving afro-house artiste that Avala is today, and she channels that new energy into her new single “MO FE BE'” a Yoruba phrase for “I WANT IT LIKE THAT.” The track captures her emotional and artistic maturity as she comes to terms with the fact that the guy she’s in love with might not be perfect and is in-fact very flawed. Nevertheless, she asserts her love for him despite the supposed better judgment of those around her.
The messages the song conveys remind listeners that love isn’t perfect but when it’s worth it, we shouldn’t give up so easily when times get rough. Mo Fe Be is a high-tempo, afrobeat and house mash-up that will definitely get your energy and feelings up and out on the dance floor. Stream the new single via Apple Music below:
