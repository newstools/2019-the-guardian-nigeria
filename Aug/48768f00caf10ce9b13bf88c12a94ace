Weeks after trucks were evacuated from Ijora-Apapa corridor, the Lagos State government yesterday carried out a massive cleanup of Apapa and its environs as part of efforts to ensure a clean city and a follow-up to the clearing of the Orile-Okoko corridor.
   
The new Managing Director of Lagos State Waste Management Agency (LAWMA), Dr. Muyiwa Gbadegesin, who led management team on both field and inspection of work already done, said the exercise is a follow-up to the work done in other parts of the city in fulfillment of the executive order of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on environment and sanitation.
 
Gbadegesin said since trucks and articulated vehicles were dislodged around Ijora, Marine Beach and Apapa, it provided the state government an opportunity to clean the corridor, which has become an eyesore due to the activities of truck drivers who littered the corridor.
