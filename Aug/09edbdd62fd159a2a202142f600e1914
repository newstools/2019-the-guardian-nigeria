Last night’s eviction on Big Brother Naija 2019: Pepper Dem saw the duo of Joe and Enkay be the latest housemates to leave the house. The duo is part of the new housemates that was introduced to the show some few weeks ago in a bid to spice things up. Spending approximately two weeks in the house, we take a look at the profile of Joe and quick facts you should know about him as we have done for all other previously evicted housemates.
