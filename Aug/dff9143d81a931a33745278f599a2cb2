 Gov. Simon Lalong of Plateau. Photo/Twitter/SimonLalong  He said: “It could be said that Lalong did not support Dalung’s appointment. And knowing this, throughout his four-year tenure, Dalung did not hide his feeling and reservation for Lalong. People say Lalong would not have appointed Tallen, knowing that they are from the same local government.”
   
So, this time, it was alleged that Lalong forwarded the name of the state APC Chairman, Latep Dabang.But before now, Dalung had avoided state functions of the party, especially when Lalong was in attendance. His attitude and actions showed that he was anti-Lalong. At other occasions, not attended by Lalong, Dalung was usually prominent and outspoken.
   
Another factor that militated against Lalong’s ministerial nominees as it appeared was the clash with the First Lady’s interest in Tallen. The latter has represented the First Lady on several occasions, making her the preferred choice in the state.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
