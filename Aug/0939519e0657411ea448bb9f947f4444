Tragedy was averted yesterday when another building collapsed in Lagos State. Thankfully, no life was lost as a two-storey building gave way yesterday morning. The building located on Adio Street, Bariga is the second building to collapse this week in the same Bariga axis of Somolu Local Government Area. A one-storey building had on Sunday night collapsed, trapping four children who were luckily rescued.
   
According to eyewitnesses present at the scene, the building in question was an old two-storey building with a penthouse that was added later to the structure. They claimed the building was already showing signs of wear and tear even before the penthouse and shops were added. Confirming the incident, spokesperson for the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Kehinde Adebayo, said they moved to the scene immediately to rescue the trapped residents. He added that after preliminary investigations and on-the-spot assessment, it was discovered that the building collapsed due to old age, wear and tear and a dearth of maintenance.
   
The Guardian observed that by late afternoon yesterday, the building had been pulled down to the ground after due consultation with the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA) and the Lagos State Material Testing Laboratory, which determined that the structure was not fit for repair of any form. He added that tests would be carried out on adjoining buildings in the area to determine if they are safe for habitation to prevent tragedy.
