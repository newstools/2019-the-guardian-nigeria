We reported earlier that celebrity couple,  Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth have gone their separate ways after less than a year of marriage. 26-year-old Cyrus in the wake of the separation has released new music titled ‘Slide Away’ and it sounds like she’s referencing her split. Cyrus’ new song sparked a firestorm of reaction on Twitter, with fans praising it as her best song yet — while also pointing out it was obviously about Hemsworth.

They became engaged in 2012 when Cyrus was just 19 but split in 2013. The couple reunited in early 2016 and married in December last year in a surprise home wedding. Shortly after the announcement of their split, Cyrus was spotted kissing reality star Kaitlynn Carter on a yacht while on vacation in Italy. Listen to her new song, Slide Away below:
