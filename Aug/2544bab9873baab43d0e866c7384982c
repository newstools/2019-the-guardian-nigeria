Sleep is not the new sex. It’s more important than that. Anyone can have sex at any time. Sleep studies tell us that people can die after 11 days without sleep but years of sex deprivation won’t kill anyone. You can live a long and productive life without sex but you can’t live without sleep. Take a look at these reasons below before you swap sex for sleep as more important.

Sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and arthritis. Getting enough sleep helps the body to reduce levels of stress and better control of blood pressure. Studies have proved people with short sleep duration tend to weigh significantly more than those who get adequate sleep. Thus forget about going on a diet. Poor sleep also affects hormones that regulate appetite. One study concluded that people who had less sleep had a reduced ability to recognise expressions of anger and happiness. Not sleeping well affects your emotions and makes you unable to interact socially. Having enough sleep makes your brain function well, according to research. When properly rested, you are refreshed and in a better state of mind to be productive as your problem-solving skills and memory are at the optimum. Performance is highly boosted by adequate sleep.
