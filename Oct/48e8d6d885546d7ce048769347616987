 [FILES] Members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) during a protest to press for the release of their leader, Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky in Lagos… 		PHOTO: EMEKA NWACHUKWU  Yahaya said despite the killing and imprisonment of its members, the group was willing to put such behind and allow peace to reign through meaningful reconciliation. He said, yesterday, in Katsina State, during a press conference in place of the usual procession to commemorate the annual Arbaeen Symbolic Trek. The Arbaeen Symbolc Trek is an event to mark the 40th day of the murder of Imam Hussein, the grandson of Prophet Mohammad, who was killed on the 10th Muharran. IMN had scheduled a trek for today across the country, but it didn’t hold in most states, due to security concerns. He said the group would never do anything or allow anyone to deceive them into engaging in any activity that would breach the country’s existing peace. Yahaya lamented the intimidation of the group’s members last Thursday by security agents in Abuja, during the annual Arbaeen procession, which led to the arrest of 15 IMN members. He complained that many of the group’s members had suffered in the hands of security agents. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
