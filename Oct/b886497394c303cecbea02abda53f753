 A player of the CHAN Eagles beaten to the ball by a Togolese when they met in the first leg of the qualifier, which ended 4-1 for Togo  The Eagles had lost 1-4 in the first leg in Togo and need three goals to be able to book a place for the CHAN scheduled for Egypt next year. Coach Imama Amapakabo had said in nff.com that the team cannot afford to lose out of the championship, which is another ground to expose the home-based players to International competition. Speaking with The Guardian yesterday, Abdullah said it was going to be a tough game overturning the 1-4 loss, but said the team needs to focus and show determination to qualify. “It is the U-23 team that have been playing the qualifiers in addition with some of the senior players of the NPFL due to the non resumption of the league in the country. I think what they are trying to do now is to strengthen the team with more senior players from the league. “In my opinion, this is not the full CHAN Eagles and it is not going to be easy for us to score four goals. With three goals, I think we will still qualify on away goal rules, he said, adding that the fans need to be patient as the goals come in. “We have to be patient with the result as it comes. These players have not been together as the handlers are trying to merge the team together. They need time to blend and that is what is affecting all of us in the Nigerian league, even those of us playing in the continental championships.“I know we will win tomorrow’s game, and let’s hope they will also qualify. They need to have it at the back of their minds that they are representing the country and I believe they will qualify with the home support by God’s grace,” he stated.
