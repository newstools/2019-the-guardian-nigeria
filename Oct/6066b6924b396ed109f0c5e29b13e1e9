Circumcision is the surgical removal of some or all of the foreskin, it is an important cultural and religious practice for many people around the world. While some see it as barbaric, some see it as a necessity. However, this process has some medical advantages that have been researched on and they are below. Reduce the chances of HIV It has been researched that circumcised males were 40-60% less likely to become infected with HIV than non-circumcised males. This means that circumcision could greatly reduce HIV rates in many countries in the world. Reduce the chances of penile and Cervical Cancer Circumcision appears to reduce the risk of penile cancer, although researchers are unsure why.  HPV contributes to the risk of penile cancer, so that is one likely reason. Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) Most UTIs in males occur during the first year of life. Circumcision reduced the risk of these infections, which can lead to hospitalization and invasive procedures in children. Sexually Transmitted Infections A possibly lower risk of men getting sexually transmissible infections (STIs) than men who are not circumcised. However, these studies have not been scientifically confirmed and safe sex practices are far more effective in preventing these infections.
