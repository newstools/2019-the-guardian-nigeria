Parents of the abducted Kaduna schoolgirls have denied the rescue of their children by police as they claimed. Six female pupils and two staff of the Engravers College, Kakau Daji in Chikun Council of Kaduna State, who were kidnapped by gunmen on October 3, were released after 23 days. The police claimed that they were rescued following an intelligence report. Addressing journalists yesterday, the parents said their children were released after they had paid ransom, although they did not disclose the amount paid. The parents, through their spokesman, Mr. Fredrick Ohemu, who insisted that their children were set free by their abductors after they paid the ransom demanded, singled out a former governor of the state for commendations. He said the former governor helped them to raise the ransom for the kidnappers provided free medical treatment for the children and the two staff. “We appreciate all Nigerians. Several people prayed in the churches and mosques. Through their prayers, God brought us help. God used a former governor of Kaduna State to assist us; encouraged us. We are in celebration mode now. “But we paid ransom before their release. We don’t want to state the amount. We thank the police as well,” he said. The parents told reporters that the girls and their teachers were really tortured by the kidnappers. “They were torturing them each time they called us (parents), so that we could hear them. They said they were being fed rice mixed with palm oil while in captivity,” he added. One of the parents, who spoke on condition of anonymity shortly after press briefing, said the police merely gave their children and the two staff free ride after the kidnappers had set them free. “We thank them (police) for giving the children and the two staff a ride.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
