Trump made cracking down on immigration a key part of his 2016 presidential campaign platform. He has pushed wide-ranging immigration law reforms, while tasking authorities with carrying out mass deportations of people in the US illegally. Last week Washington also announced plans to dramatically lower its ceiling on a decades-old refugee resettlement program by 40 percent.
