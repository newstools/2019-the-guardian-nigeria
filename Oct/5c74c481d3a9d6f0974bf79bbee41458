He survived the accident. The keke driver died on the spot.” The two ladies were rejected in the federal hospital they rushed them to because it was not the police who brought them in. “Sissy and her friend were still alive, and hence, rushed to the nearby hospital: 347 Nigerian Airforce Hospital, 303 Rayfield Road, Naf Station on Bauchi-Jos Expressway. This hospital rejected both of them. Stupid mofos wanted a Police Report, before taking them in.” The ladies died before they could be attended to in another hospital. “From there, they were rushed to another hospital, but before any medical help could be given, Jemima and Jennifer had died. Worse still, the police are currently attempting to grant the murderer of three people, bail.” The twitter user seeks justice for his sister and her friend as the drunk driver who was not harmed by the accident he caused has been taken to the police station, however, the police are planning to grant him bail.  We await responses from the accused hospital and the decisions of the Federal Police. [ad unit=2
