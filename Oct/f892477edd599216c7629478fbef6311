 [FILES] Hadi Sirika. Photo/Twitter/FAAN_Official  Sirika said the Federal Government planned to make air travel the preferred mode of transportation in Nigeria. According to him, this can be achieved, especially with a population of over 180 million and a large land mass. Nigeria and 27 other countries that make up the African Union have in the last few years signed the single-sky treaty, which requires state parties to liberalise scheduled and non-scheduled intra-Africa air transport services in line with the provisions of the Yamoussoukro Decision. In a speech presented at the ongoing 40th assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, in Montreal, Canada, the minister said a lot of initiatives had been put in place to support the open skies policy. Sirika said, â€œNigeria has been a great supporter of liberalisation and has continued to champion the liberalisation efforts in Africa through the implementation of the Yamoussoukro Decision and the Single African Air Transport Market.
