This the first single from the album soundtrack of the film, ‘Living In Bondage 2’. The song comes with a message about treating a lady right and is a mid tempo sound. The love song, produced by Gaaga himself, highlights Flavour’s vocals with its mellow sound and soft bass. On the track we have both singers pour out their hearts as they express their undying love for and how it causes them to celebrate their women daily. The beat, along with Flavour’s indigenous, highlife sound, and passionate lyrics, makes the track reminiscent of the classic Nigerian love songs of the 90s. This will be the fourth song from Gaaga Muzi this year as he has previously released Iworiwo on which he had 2Baba, ‘Low’ which had vocal help from starboy Wizkid as well as ‘In My Head’ on which he featured Patoranking.
