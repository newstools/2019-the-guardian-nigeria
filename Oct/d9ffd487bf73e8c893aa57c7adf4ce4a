Multiple Grammy award-winning rapper, Kanye West during a surprise appearance at Howard University in Washington D.C. where he held a listening party of his new album, Jesus Is King, has confirmed that he has converted to Christianity. Before his confirmation, there have been speculations about West’s religious leanings and this was fuelled further when the 42-year-old announced that he was bringing out a gospel album entitled ‘Jesus Is King’. Also, we have to pay attention that West had developed a recent tradition of holding ‘Sunday Service’ in which he shows up somewhere and performs some songs before talking about the issues of the day, including his religious faith. During the listening party, a video obtained by TMZ, West confirmed that he is officially a Christian. The video begins with West discussing a line in a Jay-Z song, where he said, ‘forced into sports or entertainment.’ “I want to let you know that I am not here for your entertainment this afternoon. We are here to spread the gospel,” West began. He later added, “Excuse me if I mispronounce anything. I am a recent convert. It means I recently got saved within this year.” Kanye West | Photo Billboard On top of spreading the good word of Jesus Christ, Kanye – who has, in the past, called himself Yeezus – held a listening party for that new album, the aforementioned ‘Jesus Is King’. Hundreds of ‘worshippers’ flocked to the university at 8 am on Sunday after they learned that West was there and performing. As for the new album, Jesus Is King, West still hasn’t confirmed when it will be released, since it was supposed to be released on September 27. Recently, Kanye’s wife Kim Kardashian was forced into swiftly deleting a photograph of the pair on Instagram because it was hi-jacked by angry fans demanding to hear the new album.
