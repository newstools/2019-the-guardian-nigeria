(Photo by Christof STACHE / AFP)  Second-half goals by Armenian forward Sargis Adamyan sealed Hoffenheim’s first-ever win in Munich as Bayern suffered a Champions League hangover after their 7-2 romp at Tottenham on Tuesday. It was Bayern’s first home defeat in the league for almost a year. Robert Lewandowski equalised at the Allianz Arena with his 11th Bundesliga goal this season, scoring for the seventh straight league game, but Adamyan clinched the win with his second. Bayern kept first place in the Bundesliga on goal difference ahead of Leipzig, Leverkusen and Freiburg, with four teams on 14 points at the top. Schalke can take over as shock leaders if they beat strugglers Cologne later on Saturday. Borussia Moenchengladbach could also go top by beating mid-table Augsburg on Sunday.
