It was previously reported that Minaj and Petty got their marriage license from a Beverly Hills courthouse. During an episode of Queen Radio in June, the “Megatron” rapper said that she and Petty had already received their marriage license. ‘We did get our marriage license. I think I have what I was striving for, just happiness,’ she explained. ‘It was so hard to get to a happy place. Now that I’m there I don’t want to compromise that for anyone of anything. Certain traveling things I don’t wanna do it. I’m just enjoying my downtime.” The pair reportedly started dating last year but became official in December. They first dated when the rapper was only 16 and living in Queens. Minaj’s romance with Petty has been a cause for constant backlash from fans consequent of Petty’s criminal records. Petty was convicted of attempted rape in 1995. He also has a first-degree manslaughter conviction in 2006 in the fatal 2002 shooting of a man named Lamont Robinson, which he served seven years of a 10-year sentence.
