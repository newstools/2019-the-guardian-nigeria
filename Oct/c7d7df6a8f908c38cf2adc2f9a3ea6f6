Award-winning director and producer, Obi Emelonye has released the first official trailer for his film which takes a look into the life of Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida.  Despite being ‘threatened’ not to release the film by political powers that be, which also led to a forced postponement of its cinema release originally slated for 29th November, it appears Emelonye has overcome whatever hurdles thrown at him. However, he picked a somewhat perfect timing to release its first official trailer on the day Nigeria celebrates its 59th birthday. Probably his own way of wishing his fellow citizens a Happy Independence Day! Watch the trailer below:
