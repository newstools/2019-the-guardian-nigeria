Nigerian Correctional Service said it has set up a “high powered panel” to investigate the allegations in an investigative report made by undercover journalist Fisayo Soyombo. The first instalment of the three-part investigation by Soyombo exposed how Nigerian policemen “pervert the course of justice in their quest for ill-gotten money”. In the second part of the investigation published on Monday by The Cable exposed “how the courts short-change the law, and the prisons are themselves a cesspool of the exact reasons for which they hold inmates.” He spent eight days as an inmate in Ikoyi Prison — to track corruption in Nigeria’s criminal justice system. He documented experiences on “drug abuse, sodomy, bribery, pimping and cash and carry operations” at the facility. In reaction to the allegations, the Controller General, Ja’afaru Ahmed said a “high powered panel” has been set up “to immediately commence full investigations into the matter in order to establish the authenticity of the report, identify and bring the culprits to book if found guilty of the allegations.” The statement by the service’s spokesman, OF Enobore, highlighted that the service is “willing to work” with the general public and relevant stakeholders in the justice to transform the Correctional Service into “a modern reformatory institution that operates in line with best international practices.” The investigation has generated widespread reactions on the social media. On Tuesday, there were reports that Soyombo may be arrested by the Nigerian authorities. The Guardian learned that Soyombo’s story has irked the Nigerian prison authorities, especially the comptroller-general of the prison services. A security source told The Guardian Soyombo may be arrested and be “charged to court and prosecuted under Section 29 of the Nigeria Correctional Service Act.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
