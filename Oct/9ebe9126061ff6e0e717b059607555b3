The Foursquare Gospel Church in Nigeria Monday has ordered Pastor Boniface Igbeneghu who was caught on camera sexually harassing a BBC undercover reporter to step down. “The general public is hereby informed that a holiness ad Bible believing Church we do not condone such heinous and unscriptural  act among our minsters,” the church said in a statement. “Meanwhile, the pastor in question has been asked to step down from all ministerial assignment.” Igbeneghu was caught on camera for sexually harassing a BBC undercover reported who pretended to be a student seeking admission into the University of Lagos. BBC reported that nine months of investigation in University of Lagos led the team to Igbeneghu, a senior lecturer and a former sub-dean of faculty of arts. The footage by BBC Africa Eye’s reporter Kiki Mordi was secretly filmed and investigated sexual harassment by lecturers at UNILAG and University of Ghana. In the 13-minutes secret filming, the “student” posing as a 17-year-old endured a couple of sexual harassment from Dr Igbeneghu. “Switch off that light, I’ll kiss you for a minute,” Igbeneghu told the student during her visit to his office after he had promised to help her with tutorials to pass her entrance exam into the school. “Everything that we discussed here, be assured that your mother will not hear and anything that happens between me and you, nobody will hear about it,” he added. The lecturer went to the bathroom and upon his return, he locked the door, switched off the light and embraced the student. A graduate of UNILAG  also confessed to BBC that she almost committed suicide three times after being assaulted by the lecturer during her years in school.
