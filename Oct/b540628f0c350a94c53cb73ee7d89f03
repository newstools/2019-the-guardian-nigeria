A-Q Wades Into Vector-M.I Beef With “Distractions 2” The beef between M.I Abaga and Vector Tha Viper has taken a new turn as 100 Crowns label head A-Q has released a diss track aimed at Vector titled “Distractions 2”. A-Q whose real name is Gilbert Bani, appears to be displeased about Vector’s claim that he brought him on into the industry. Vector had made this claim in #JudasTheRat: “Who are the rappers that I put on? Many more plus two out of your three. And I didn’t sign anything, I did it all for free.” Vector had previously worked with AQ. Vector featured AQ, Terry Tha Rapman and X.O. Senavoe on the 2011 song, “Ginja”. In 2012, AQ featured Vector on “Distractions” off his “Make Your Best Rapper Look Stupid“ EP, that first distraction track turned out to be a diss track at Reminisce. AQ refuses to accept Vector’s claim. He took to his twitter page to vent: “I’ve been off this energy for sometime now and I’d have liked it to stay that way.. But there is no way I’d let the narrative that a snake put me on go down in history .. THIS IS NOT A DISS, THIS IS ALL FACTS #Distraction2 #Iknowtoomuch”  “Get all the Social media influencers you want.. Use all the social media tricks in the world.. You can’t hide from the truth… You and I know what’s really going on. Don’t you ever in your life say you put me on, F***ing ingrate” “I did not talk about what happened with your group Badda boiz, I did not talk about a certain female rapper or your yankee trip for the mavado song and so on.. Go ahead.. Force my hand, you’d get #Distraction2, 3 and 4 at least, I got all month“ Listen to “Distraction 2” below:
