Club installs new president
The District 9110 Governor, Rotary International, Dr. Jide Akeredolu, has urged the government and Nigerians not to relent in the fight against polio, saying, lots of effort was needed for the country to be officially labeled polio-free. He noted that though the country has reached a major milestone by going three consecutive years without a case of polio, which makes Nigeria no longer endemic, immunisation of the children should not cease. Akeredolu spoke at the installation of Rtn. Abdulkareem Musa as the 34th president of the Rotary Club of Akowonjo, held in Lagos. He noted that given that there were two countries left still infected with the disease, Pakistan and Afghanistan and a lot of them work in Nigeria, it is easy for the country to be infected again. In his acceptance speech, Musa said he will carry out projects within the ambit of Rotary’s six areas of focus and connect with all members to ensure the core values of the club is upheld, guided by the four-way test. “Emphasis will be on economic empowerment. We intend giving micro-credit facility to about 100 market women within Alimosho local government area. “Adult literacy has been one of our signature project for over 20 years and we intend to continue in this direction. Indeed, we have just flag off the next batch of students for the 2019/2020 Rotary year.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
