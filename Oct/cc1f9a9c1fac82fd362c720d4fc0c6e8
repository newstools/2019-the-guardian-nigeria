 “Almost all the major roads in Port Harcourt have been awarded for reconstruction.  Therefore, identify the roads that have not been awarded, but have potholes. “When you identify these roads with potholes, funds will be released for their immediate rehabilitation.”He clarified that the agency had no powers to award contracts, adding that it awarded N1 billion projects in the past without authorisation. Wike said that the organisation was the direct labour arm of the Rivers State Government targeted at ensuring that roads do not degenerate. “Make our roads motorable.  That is your basic function.  This agency is very important to the Rivers State Government.  That is why you must work day and night to achieve results,” he charged.
