 Oto ‘Joe Boy’ Joseph  The fight tagged ‘Fight of The Decade’ is scheduled to hold at the Indoor Sports Hall of the National Stadium, Lagos. It is the headline bout for the GOtv Boxing Night 20. It has generated a lot of interest among Nigerian boxing fans, as Joy Boy and Real One are considered the best pugilists in the country at the moment. The challenger, Real One, launched a verbal attack on Joe Boy recently when he described him (Joe Boy) as a coward and boxer with limited ability. He boasted that he would expose the ABU champion’s limitations in brutal fashion. “I know him very well. He is my boy; I know what he can do and what he can’t. He relies on raw power. He has no boxing brain. But raw power can only work against low-grade boxers. I’m not in that category. The ABU title is for me. His limited ability has taken him as far as it can. It is the end of the road for him on October 12,” Real One had stated after training at the Teslim Balogun Stadium. It was learnt yesterday that organisers of the fight were confused yesterday on whether or not to go ahead with plans for the event. No official was ready to comment on Joy Boy’s injury yesterday.
