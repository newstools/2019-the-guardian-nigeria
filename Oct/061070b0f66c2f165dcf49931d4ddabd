Aina, a defender for Torino in the Serie A, was among the 23-man squad named by the coach Gernot Rohr for the match against Brazil. Nigerian will play Brazil on Sunday, October 13 at the Singapore National Stadium. But Aina will not feature because “He picked up an injury after a domestic accident and will not be available.” Rohr is expected to name a replacement for the defender. Leganes defender, Kenneth Omeruo and Bordeaux’s Samuel Kalu have also been ruled out due to injury since the initial team announcement by Rohr. Tyronne Ebuehi has been called up to replace Omeruo while Viv Solomon-Otabor was handed his first call-up to replace Kalu.
