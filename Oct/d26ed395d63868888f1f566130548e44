Award-winning actress and singer, Miley Cyrus has never shied from her drug fueled past  by admitting that she has used to do drugs including MDNA and marijuana. The 25-year-old star in 2013 sang about it in her hit song, “We Can’t Stop” and while many may want to blame her recent actions on drugs, she has made it clear she is sober. She has also been tweeting about her experiences over the summer. On August 22, she took to Twitter and wrote: “It is no secret that I was into partying in my teens and early 20’s. I have not only smoked, but advocated for weed, I’ve experimented with drugs, my biggest song to date is about dancing on molly and snorting lines in the bathroom.” In an Instagram announcement, the ‘Slide Away’ singer told her fans: “I’m four months sober. It’s the best I’ve ever felt. I’m radiating.” Coincidentally, Cyrus’ four-month timeline corresponds with her breakup from husband, Liam Hemsworth. It would be recalled that we reported the estranged couple announced they were going their separate ways after only eight months of marriage in August. Shortly after their split was announced, Cyrus had a six-week fling with 31-year-old Kaitlynn Carter and is currently dating 22-year-old Cody Simpson who is her longtime friend Cody Simpson. Simpson joined Cyrus through her Instagram Live announcement and the pair hilariously chatted and flirted while answering questions from fans — even revealing details about their first kiss! The duo of Cyrus and Simpson were first seen kissing at Backyard Bowls in Los Angeles on October 3. Simpson went on to confirm that he is in a relationship with Cyrus at Tiffany & Co.’s Mens Launch event on Oct. 11. He said: “We both met back in the day when we were partying a lot had a lot of fun then, but now we found each other in a space where we’re not partying, working real hard, and it just keeps things healthy.”
