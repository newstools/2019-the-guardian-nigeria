 Naomi Watts “Game Of Thrones” Prequel Unimpressive | Photo: Poster Foundry As reported by TV Line, the pilot for the spinoff of “Game of Thrones” prequel by Jane Goldman and headlined by Naomi Watts is unimpressive and has been cancelled. The cabler has opted not to move forward with this project. HBO executives screened the pilot over the summer and were not thrilled with the results. At first, they sent Goldman and Co. back into the editing room to make some changes, however, the revamped pilot failed to impress the executives either, leading them to pull the plug altogether. HBO ordered a pilot for the untitled prequel last month, with the action set thousands of years before the events of Game of Thrones. As stated in an official logline, “…the series chronicles the world’s descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour. And only one thing is for sure: from the horrifying secrets of Westeros’ history to the true origin of the white walkers, the mysteries of the East to the Starks of legend… it’s not the story we think we know.” HBO is expected to move forward with another Game of Thrones prequel project, this one that would trace the glory days of House Targaryen. The project has earned an official pilot order at HBO.
