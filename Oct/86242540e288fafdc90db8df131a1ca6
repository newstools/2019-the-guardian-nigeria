“Joker” Becomes Highest Grossing R-rated Film Ever | Digital Spy “Joker” the film which stars Joaquin Phoenix as a troubled man who turns into a killer clown is now the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time. Warner Bros confirmed on Friday that the film which centred on the origin of Batman’s crazed arch rival has made roughly $788 million at the worldwide box office thereby surpassing “Deadpool,” which made $783 million globally when it came out in 2016. The dark themed film is quite a surprising success in spite of concerns over its depiction of violence. In “Joker” Joaquin Phoenix features as failed comedian Arthur Fleck who seeks connection as he walks the streets of Gotham City. Arthur wears two masks — the one he paints for his day job as a clown, and the guise he projects in a futile attempt to feel like he’s part of the world around him. Isolated, bullied and disregarded by society, Fleck begins a slow descent into madness as he transforms into the criminal mastermind known as the Joker. Ryan Reynolds took to his Twitter page to congratulate “Joker’s” success. He tweeted: “R-rated box office congratulatory posts aren’t like the ones you’re used to.” Other top R-rated worldwide grossers are 2003’s “The Matrix Reloaded” at $738.6 million, 2017’s “It” ($697 million) and 2003’s “The Passion of the Christ” ($622.3 million).
