Sokoto Rima were made to rue their missed chances as they lost by a point to De Defenders on matchday four of the on-going Prudent Energy Handball Premier League holding at the Rowe Park, Yaba, Lagos. The Sarduana boys lost by 27 to 28 DE Defenders in a pulsating game, which they had the opportunity to win but for ill luck and wasted chances. Rima had made the clash a difficult one for De Defenders, as spectators were thrilled to a spectacular balanced game from both teams. In other games, Niger United, Safety Shooters and Imo Grasshoppers scaled through the hurdles in yesterday’s men and women’s categories of the competition. Defending champion, Niger United in another match displaced the whipping boys of the championship, Owena Kings 47-29. The result made it four out of four victories for United, who are now third on the table, and have the hope of qualifying for the Africa Championship next year. Safety Shooters in the other fixture beat Borno Spiders 39-26 to also record four wins out of four games in the championship. The Spiders had no answer to the business-like Shooters, who took their opponents to the cleaners in the one-sided clash. In the women’s class, former champions, Imo Grasshoppers yesterday subdued the Desert Queens 32-16. The veteran of the championship had seized the opportunity of the naivety of their opponents by unleashing attacks and at the end of the day recorded a heavy score line against inexperienced Desert girls.
