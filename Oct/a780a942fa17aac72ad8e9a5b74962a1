Multiple Grammy award-winning songstress, Mariah Carey may have sang ‘We Belong Together’ but Nick Cannon was definitely not in mind when she sang that. The sensational songstress has reacted to reports that her ex-husband, Nick Cannon has interest in rekindling their flame and giving marriage between them another shot. According to a report by celebrity gossip site, TMZ, Carey thinks Cannon is just being silly when he says he wants to rekindle their flame because she is definitely not on the same wave. Again, she may have crooned ‘Don’t Forget About Us’ but she is giving vibes that she has forgotten about Cannon. Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon | Photo – Entertainment Tonight TMZ caught up with her yesterday, October 11 while leaving lunch at Mr. Chow in Beverly Hills and when she was asked how she feels about her ex-husband’s recent comments about wanting to get back together, she says she thinks he is just kidding about the whole re-marriage thing and she’s not taking his comments seriously.
