Stroke affects about 200,000 people in Nigeria yearly while 88,000 die in the first three months. The World Health Organisation (WHO) revealed this yesterday in commemoration of the World Stroke Day. Chief Executive Officer, Stroke Action Nigeria, Rita Melifonwu, said the day focused on stroke risks and prevention.
