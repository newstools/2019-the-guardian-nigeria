Senator Uche Ekwunife has raised a petition on behalf of a member of her constituency, Anambra Central District, on the refusal of Joint Admission Matriculation Board (JAMB) to release his result based on his excellent result which is alleged to be suspicious. The senator made the petition on the floor, on Tuesday, seeking an intervention from the senate. JAMB registered about 1.8 million candidates for the Unified Tertiary Matriculations Examination (UTME).  76.2 per cent of the 1,792,719 candidates who sat for 2019 examination scored below 200 out of 400. JAMB registrar Professor Ishaq Oloyede said in May, “34,120 candidates had their result withheld for examination malpractice also 15,145 results were withheld for further clarification.” He mentioned that some of the irregularities that marred the 2019 UTME include; multiple registrations, manipulation of biometrics, impersonation and deliberate destruction of power sources during the examination. Ekwunife, who made a vow to fight for the right of all the people of Anambra during her campaign, issued the petition based on protecting every citizen’s right. In 2018, JAMB recorded 280 cases of examination malpractice across the country, while in 2017, it recorded 2,508 cases. The senator, Uche Ekwufeni awaits the senate decision to intervene in the candidate result. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
