Marking the day at the Ado-Odo/Ota Branch of NUT, at Ansar-Ud-Deen Comprehensive College, Ota, Ogun State, the Branch Chairman, Safar Asade, said since education is the bedrock of any nation’s development, teachers are central to achieving educational goals that can lead to national development. He stressed the need for the government at all levels to invest in the training and re-training of teachers in line with the global trend for them to continue to impart relevant, current, and up-to-date knowledge in pupils. “A situation where teachers don’t have adequate training and facilities to teach is spelling doom for the educational system. The teaching environment should be conducive for the teachers.” He also condemned sexual harassment in educational institutions and urged the government to ensure proper investigation and adequate sanctions for culprits of the heinous crime. The Ogun State Chairman of NUT, Titilope Adebanjo, noted that although the union went through a tough times during the last administration, since the present administration under Prince Dapo Abiodun took the mantle of leadership, it has initiated a good working relationship with the union. He, however, appealed to the State Government to ensure teachers’ promotion as and when due, payment of leave grants from 2015 to date, employment of new teachers to replace retired ones from both primary and secondary schools, and regular release of subventions to schools and unions. The event, which was co-sponsored by MTN Nigeria, Nestle Nigeria, Dr. BrownWemmy and Chemstar, featured a lecture on “Young Teachers and the Future of the Profession,” health talk, novelty match, and cultural display.
