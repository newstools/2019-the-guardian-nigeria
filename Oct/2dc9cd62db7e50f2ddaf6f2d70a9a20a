Long-term, South Sudan aims to ramp up production to 350,000 bpd, Oler added without specifying a time frame. That level was South Sudan’s peak production before 2012 when a five-year civil war brought the young country’s oil industry to a virtual standstill. “I am optimistic that we are moving toward a stable government,” Oler said. South Sudan’s President, Salva Kiir, and rebel leader, Riek Machar, have agreed to form a transitional government by the middle of November, the information minister said last month. South Sudan made a small oil discovery in Northern Upper Nile State in August, its first since independence in 2011. It is expected to launch an oil and gas licensing round at the conference on Thursday. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
