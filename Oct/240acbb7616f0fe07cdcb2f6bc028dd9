According to AFP, Maleficient generated $65 million at the domestic box office. The dark fantasy sequel continues to be a bigger player overseas, where it pulled in another $64.3 million for an international haul of $228 million. Globally, the “Maleficent” follow-up is nearing the $300 million mark. For a second consecutive weekend, it held off Warner Bros.’ scare-fest “Joker,” starring Joaquin Phoenix, which managed $19.2 million for the Friday-to-Sunday period to finish a narrow second. “Joker” had appeared to hold a slender lead in early box office estimates. The film, with Phoenix incarnating Batman’s notorious nemesis, has now taken approximately $850 million globally, becoming the most successful R-rated movie in history, according to Variety. With Halloween only days away, scary movies did well overall. In third spot was “The Addams Family” from United Artists, at $12 million. The computer animation, following the spooky Addams Family and some creepy relatives, features the voices of Oscar Isaac, Charlize Theron, Snoop Dogg, and Bette Midler. In fourth, at $11.8 million in its second week out, was Sony’s “Zombieland: Double Tap,” a comedy sequel starring Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Luke Wilson. The new release “Countdown” from STX films placed fifth at $8.9 million. The low-budget horror film tells the tale of a nurse (Elizabeth Lail) who finds an app that predicts exactly when people will die — and learns her own death is only days away. “Joker” recently became the most successful R-rated movie in history.
