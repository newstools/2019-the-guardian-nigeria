Shakira’s long awaited documentary, titled Shakira in Concert: El Dorado World Tour, will hit select theaters in November. As fans and the likes count down to its release, the Colombian singer released a medley of “La La La” and “Waka Waka” as the first full song performance clip on Friday, October 11. The exhilarating performance is a fusion of her two soccer anthems: the official 2010 FIFA World Cup theme song, “Waka Waka (This Time For Africa)” and “La La La,” which she performed at the 2014 World Cup in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  Directed by Shak and James Merryman, the concert film will relive her show at The Forum in Los Angeles, shot in August 2018, with additional live and behind-the-scenes footage captured throughout U.S., Europe, and Latin America The film tells “the story of the triumphant tour through Shakira’s own words, giving fans an immersive and insightful look into what it took to bring the show to 22 countries and nearly a million fans, after having to postpone the entire tour due to a vocal cord injury in November 2017,” as an official press release notes. Shakira in Concert: El Dorado World Tour will premiere Nov. 13 in more than 2,000 theaters in over 60 countries, for a one-night global event with encore screenings in select locations. U.S. theaters are set to show the film on November 13 and 17.
