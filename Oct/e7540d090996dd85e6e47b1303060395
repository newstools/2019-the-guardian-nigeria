French Open winner Barty retains top spot and even extends her lead following the failure of Karolina Pliskova to get past the first round in China. Osaka’s rise to three means Elina Svitolina, a quarter-finalist in Beijing, slips to four. US Open champion Bianca Andreescu, who lost a thrilling quarter-final to Osaka last week, also climbs a place to number five pushing Simona Halep down to six. ATP Rankings as of October 7: 1.
