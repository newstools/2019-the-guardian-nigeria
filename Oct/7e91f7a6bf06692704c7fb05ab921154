The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Nestle Nigeria, Beta Glass, Unilever Nigeria, Guinness Nigeria and Dangote Sugar Refinery.Analysts at Codros Capital Limited said the trend witnessed so far is likely to persist through the final quarter of the year. “Though we expect pockets of gains over the final months of the year as fund and portfolio managers realign portfolios prior to the start of 2020.“Nonetheless, we note that valuations remain attractive driven by price deterioration throughout the year. Hence, we advise that long-term investors consider appropriately timed investments. The Chief Research Officer of Investdata Consulting, Ambrose Omodion, said the market extension of its negative sentiment for the third consecutive sessions last week through selloffs and dwindling confidence in the global economic outlook, clouded the domestic market. “This arose from the fact that liquidity flowing into the equity market remained relatively low, given that fund managers had slowed down their buying interest on news of a weak global manufacturing sector. “The slowdown in economic activities in developed economies is a pure reflection of the impact of the lingering U.S-China trade war on confidence. Weakening confidence, as know, ultimately leads to weaker economic activities.“On the domestic environment, banks must implement the CBN directive to further increase their LDR from the 60 per cent  threshold set in July to 65 per cent by December 31, 2019. “The further increase could naturally reduce lending rates among banks, while they compete for borrowers who, as the new brides, would naturally ask for lower rates, as the banks rush to meet the set regulatory benchmark,” he said.
