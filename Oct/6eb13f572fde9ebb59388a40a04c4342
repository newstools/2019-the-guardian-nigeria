The Borno State Governor, Prof Babagana Zulum, has ordered Secretary to the State Government (SSG), and Head of Service (HoS), to immediately transfer all staff of the Pension Board and Salaries. The transfer of all Board’s staffers by Usman Jidda Shuwa, and Mohammed Hassan, was over alleged anomalies identified by Zulum in the payments of gratuities to retired civil servants and selected pensioners. The Governor handed down the order while swearing in 14 newly-appointed Permanent Secretaries at the Government House, Maiduguri.
He said when he took over the mantle of leadership, he promised to reinvigorate the Civil Service for increased efficiency and productivity, and also to improve the institutional and human capacities to work and handle issues effectively and transparently. He described permanent secretaries as the engine room that is expected to transform Borno’s development agenda. “As technical heads of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), you are expected to spearhead the implementation of all policies and programmes of government,” he said.He urged them to ensure probity and prudence in public finance management with discipline and efficient management of human resources.
