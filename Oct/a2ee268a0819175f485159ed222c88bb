Passengers on board a commercial bus, popularly called Danfo, yesterday escaped death after the bus plunged into a canal in front of the National Theatre complex, Iganmu, Lagos. They were all rescued unhurt. It was gathered that the vehicle, with registration number MUS 68 XH, suddenly developed technical problem and plunged into the canal opposite National Theatre entrance. The bus driver, Mr. Augustine Okorie, said the number of passengers in the vehicle was 29. He described the survival of the passengers as a ‘miracle.’ “I was bringing in 29 passengers from Shinbiri area in Okokomaiko, Badagry expressway and on getting to the front of the National Art Theatre, I lost control and the vehicle plunged into the canal. As I was about to change the gear, it got stuck and could not move. Immediately, the vehicle started to swerve uncontrollably and before you know what was happening, we found ourselves inside the canal. In spite of the situation, I was so worried about my conductor who was hanging by the door, but we thank God none of us sustained injury,” Okorie said. An official of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), who refused to be identified, said at the scene of the accident that they quickly alerted other emergency and traffic management agencies who assisted in the quick rescue of occupant of the vehicle. The vehicle was brought out of the canal 30 minutes later by officials of Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA).
