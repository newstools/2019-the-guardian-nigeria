Oscar award-winning Hollywood actress, Jennifer Lawrence and her heartthrob, Cooke Maroney got married over the weekend in Belcourt of Newport, a pretty spectacular Rhode Island mansion. It is also gathered that the estate where the wedding went down was inspired by Louis XIII. It resembles a hunting lodge at Versailles.

The wedding had 150 guests show up and the meal included 5-week-aged leg of beef with forager’s sauce and salt cod beignets. They had a bunch of desserts, including house-made marshmallow s’mores. It would be recalled that the 29-year-old JLaw as she is fondly called met the 34-year-old Maroney last year and got engaged this past February. Maroney who is an art gallery director, doesn’t seem thirsty at all for the attention that comes with marrying a famous actress like JLaw because when she walked a red carpet, he wasn’t present.
