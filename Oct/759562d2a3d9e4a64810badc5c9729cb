Nigeriaâ€™s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has recovered N65, 548, 000 from officials of the office of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Zamfara State. EFCC in a statement said the money in higher denominations of Naira notes was recovered from two fireproof safes during a search in the offices of the head of accounts and cashier of INEC in the state. The operation was carried out in response to a petition by an ad-hoc staff of the electoral body, alleging that officials of the Commission illegally deducted part of the allowance due them for the last general election. According to the complainant, while INEC in Zamfara allegedly paid its ad hoc staff the sum of N9,000, others in states like Sokoto were paid N12,000.
