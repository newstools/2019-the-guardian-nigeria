In line with its avowed zero tolerance for indiscriminate waste disposal, the Lagos State government at the weekend arrested some residents of Aboru in Alimosho area of the state. The violators (names withheld) were caught emptying their bags of trash in a drainage channel at the front of their home during a recent downpour on the instructions of their parents. Managing Director of Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA), Dr. Muyiwa Gbadegesin, said the culprits would be prosecuted in accordance with relevant environmental laws in the state. He reminded residents of Governor Sanwo-Olu’s executive order on zero tolerance to environmental infractions, stressing that violators would be appropriately sanctioned under relevant environmental laws of the state, which forbade indiscriminate refuse disposal by residents. The LAWMA boss also emphasized the need for residents to support efforts of the state government in tackling the problem of flooding and other environmental hazards in the metropolis by ensuring that they do not dispose refuse in a manner likely to cause pollution of the environment or harm human health. “They are also enjoined to bag their wastes appropriately and patronize assigned PSP operators”, he stressed. Gbadegesin further stressed that LAWMA had intensified the distribution of waste disposal bags under its Blue Box Initiative, for residents to sort their waste and dispose appropriately through PSPs operating in their areas. The LAWMA boss warned that under no circumstances should anyone dump refuse in drainage channels, medians, lagoons or any other unauthorised outlets.He also advised residents to promptly contact the Authority using the toll-free line 07080601020, for complaints and relevant information.
