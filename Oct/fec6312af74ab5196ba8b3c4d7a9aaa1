 OPEC  In Venezuela, on which U.S. sanctions targeting its oil sector have also been tightened, crude output shrank to 600,000b/d in September, the Platts found, even less than the 650,000 b/d it pumped in January 2003, with the PDVSA strike in full effect.
   
Other significant falls in September included one in Iraq, where production was down 80,000 b/d, under pressure from Saudi Arabia at an OPEC/non-OPEC monitoring committee meeting in Abu Dhabi just days before the attacks. New Saudi Energy Minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, had publicly called on Iraq, Nigeria, and other countries pumping above their committed output quotas to tighten compliance.
 
Iraq’s September production of 4.80 million b/d is still significantly over its cap of 4.51 million b/d. It had hit an all-time high in August.
  
Libya posted the sole rise of note, with its production growing 90,000 b/d in September due to the restart of its Sharara oil field in late August, according to the survey.
  
Ecuador, OPEC’s fourth-largest producer, announced last week it was quitting OPEC at the end of the year, citing fiscal austerity measures, as it pursues higher oil revenues unconstrained by its production quota. The country pumped 540,000 b/d in September, the survey found. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
