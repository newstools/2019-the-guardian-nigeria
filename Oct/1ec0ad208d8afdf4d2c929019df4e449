Barely 48 hours after the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) arrested a former Secretary-General of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN), Amaechi Akawu over allegations of misappropriation of $130, 000 belonging to the International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF), another official of the body has been invited for questioning on issues bordering on financial transactions. The ICPC in a letter of invitation marked ICPC/INV/NGB/T.AFI/103, dated October 29 and addressed to the President of AFN, Ibrahim Gusau stated: “The Commission is investigating a case that borders on alleged violation of the provision of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, 2000. “In view of the above and pursuant to Section 28 of the said Act, you are required to inform and release Adeleye Sunday O., a member of the board (AFN) to appear before the undersigned at the Commission’s headquarters Abuja, for purpose of interview on Wednesday, 30 October, 2019 by 1000hrs.” The letter signed by Prince Hassan Mohammed, Acting HOD (Investigation) for Hon. Chairman, added: “He is to come along with certified true copies of all the expenditure and retirement made in respect of the 2017 Confederation of Africa Athletics Grand Prix/Warri Relay, which held in Ozoro, Delta State on the 18th of July, 2017. “Please note that he is also expected to come along with one of the following: a lawyer, a justice of Peace, a member of the civil organization or a trusted person of his choice.” The Guardian recalls that Akawu was arrested by the ICPC a few days ago over allegations of misappropriation of IAAF’s $130, 000 and was subsequently released on administrative bail the next day to enable him submit some vital documents that were requested by investigators handling the case. A probe panel set up by Sports Minister, Sunday Dare to investigate the AFN, following poor result at the 2019 World Athletics Championship in Doha only submitted its report on Monday.
