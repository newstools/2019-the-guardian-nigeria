After the first look was the runway show where designers from Africa and Japan showcased their designs.  The first on the runway was the Orange Culture and the models came out with cubic designs, square silhouette and avant-garde slits and a mixture of nude panels contrasting with a traditional African palette and muted oranges. These colours are mixed with terracotta red and desert-dusk browns. Another designer to walk the runway is Yutee Rone. The models came with bejeweled tones and diamante YT resurrects Edwardian England in his high neck collars, sweeping floor-length skirts, padded shoulders and corset pinched waists all in 50s Siren dreamy pink pastels. Velvet, tulle, satin, and silk enveloped by willowy cartoon eyed models cast a dream-like haze over her collection. Next is the Jermaine Bleu. Schoolboy meets athleisure in neon collection. The designs are anti-traditional cuts over basic closet look. If you can imagine what a college kid looks like in uniform, you can imagine what these designs look like. After this, the designer with the name WUMAN came on the runway. It is neon done right, she channels 40s comics with color block shift dresses, boat line necks and frayed edges bursting at the seams with comic panels and abstract sketches. His aggressively unmodern designs refuse to submit to current fashion trends, unapologetically retro, androgynous and weird. He just made himself a name as Lagos’ very own Scott Campbell all without a fishnet or jogger insight. As opposed to the name, the design is for both males and females. Up next we have Bloke. A combination of primary colours in traditional African silhouettes mixed with loosely tied men’s skirts, loose baggy pants, and Agbada inspired sets with zesty modern twists, lace-up sides, sheer panels, contrast suits, and tie-dye waistcoats. The models wore only one leg of shoes, the motive for this mentally unanswered. Next design, Dzyn seems like “owanbe” clothes with net veils draping over. Her mini bags steal the show, ranging from wood to metal their bejeweled surfaces, glossy handles, cage, and kettle like aesthetics. We look forward to tomorrow’s runway show.
