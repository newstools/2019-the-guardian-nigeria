• Commercial Viability Yet To Be Ascertained 
The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), yesterday, announced the discovery of crude oil and gas in the Kolmani River II Well on the Upper Benue Trough, Gongola Basin. However, the corporation noted that the commercial viability of the discovery coming from drilling of a total depth of 13,701 feet before hitting oil and gas in several levels is yet to be ascertained. The group in a statement added that that a Drill Stem Test (DST) is currently on-going to confirm the commercial viability and flow of the Kolmani River reservoirs. President Muhammadu Buhari had on February 2, 2019 flagged off drilling of the Kolmani River II Well insisting that there was need to explore hydrocarbon across the country. NNPC said the outcome of the search would be announced in 60 days after activities began, but this is coming eight months after. Recalled that about 40 years ago, the Federal Government commenced the search for oil in the northern part of country. While the initial plan of the well drilling was designed to be 14,500 feet, the eventual drilling activities with ‘IKENGA RIG 101’ stopped at 13,701 feet after encountering oil and gas in several levels.
