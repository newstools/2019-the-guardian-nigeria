Three suspects arrested in Britain over the deaths of 39 people found in a refrigerated truck have been released on bail, police said Sunday. They are a man and woman, both 38, from Warrington in northwest England, and a 46-year-old Northern Irish man who had been held at London's Stansted Airport. They were arrested two days after the bodies of eight women and 31 men were discovered Wednesday in a truck in an industrial zone in Grays in Essex, southeast England.
