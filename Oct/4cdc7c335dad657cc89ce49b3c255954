He stated that for Nigeria to solve the problem of electricity federal government must ensure that the due process and transparency are strengthened in all appropriate quarters where decisions are taken on licensing subsidy, power purchase agreements contracts, operational equipment procurements, and metering among others. He made this recommendation at a media launch of report titled ‘Kept in Darkness: Holding Non-Performance Electricity Contractors Accountable’ organized by Centre for Health Equity and Justice (CEHEJ), held in Ikeja, Lagos, adding that the report undertakes systems checks with a view to strengthening and entrenching solid accountability regime in power sector contracts in Nigeria. Oke who is the Lead Researcher of the study explained that those who failed to perform or deliver on contractual obligations, duties, and responsibilities in the power sector are held accountable and punished under the existing law, contractual agreements and document. He said: “It also reports specific the scandals and waste of taxpayers’ money in the area of power sector contracts awarded to specific corporations by the Nigerian Government”. “Government must ensure an independent regulatory regime in the power sector to bring about the creation of an effective regulatory regime that is independent of the government. To be truly independent, a regulator must exhibit all known features of a truly independent regulator”. Executive Director CEHEJ, Timothy Adewale said that corruption is deeply rooted and pervasive, but it can be fought successfully through empowering consumers and civil society by providing them access to information and the opportunity to participate in policymaking including the right to contract document signed in the power sector.
