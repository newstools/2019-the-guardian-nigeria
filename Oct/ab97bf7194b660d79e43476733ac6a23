The Court of Appeal sitting in Kaduna, Kaduna State, has affirmed Uba Sani as the elected senator for Kaduna Senatorial District in the February 23 National Assembly election. It also awarded N100,000 in his favour to cover litigation expenses. Reading the 20-minute judgement yesterday, Justice Adefope Okojie said the court upheld the earlier decision of the election petition tribunal. Simplifying the appellate court’s ruling outside the courtroom, the lead counsel to Sani, Frank Ikpe, said all the three grounds on which the case was initiated against his client were without sufficient evidence. “Today, the Court of Appeal upheld the judgement of the local tribunal on three issues. The first was whether Uba Sani was qualified to contest, being a political office-holder. The second issue was whether there was electoral malpractice in some councils, and the third was non-compliance with relevant provisions. All the three were resolved in favour of Sani. “I am of the firm belief that both the tribunal and the Court of Appeal did substantial justice in upholding the tenets of our democracy. In this regard, I believe Sani will now be given the opportunity to represent his people without distraction,” Ikpe said. He added that the N100,000 awarded to his client was not enough because the case had been in court for seven months. “We thought the court would have awarded more. The amount was to cover the expenses, but I don’t know what N100,000 will do. Nevertheless, we accepted it.” Another counsel in Sani’s legal team, Sule Shuaibu, said, “What the judgement simply means is that justice is served the way it should be seen served. We are grateful to Almighty God.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
