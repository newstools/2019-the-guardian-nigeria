The Nigerian Association Petroleum Explorationists (NAPE), has urged the Federal Government to address concerns bordering on the long contracting cycle in the petroleum industry, adding that such practice continues to hamper investments and development.
    
According to the body, the long contracting cycle results in a high level of uncertainties in costing and planning thereby creating a sluggish business climate.
  
NAPE President, Ajibola Oyebamiji, noted that although there has been an improvement in the cycle, the reality is that operators still find the contracting cycle exceeding what ought to be for investors, especially for the International Oil Companies (IOCs), who need quick decisions.  He said it would also address production in the onshore, offshore and Nigeria’s frontier basins, as well as seek new approaches for exploration and production in the Cretaceous and Cenozoic basins.
  
“The conference will also be beaming its searchlight on new technology application in exploration and production using big data, digitalisation, data analytics, and artificial intelligence opportunities, among others.
 
“Participants at the conference will also be discussing the contributions of indigenous/marginal field operators and the imperatives of growing national reserves and grooming the next generation of E&P professionals.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
