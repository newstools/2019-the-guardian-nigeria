The Nigeria Correction Service (NCS) Volleyball Club’s hope of clinching the national league is almost becoming a reality following their 3-0 (25-20, 25-21) defeat of Kada Kings to maintain their unbeaten run in the ongoing division one play-off in Bauchi. The duo of Dauda Saje and Emenike Ezike of NCS capitalised on Kada Stars’ lapses to lead their side to victory in the competition. Prior to the Day Four loss, Kada Stars had recorded three straight wins at the league. Speaking after the tie, Nigeria Correction Service star, Saje said his team was prepared to outplay any other side in the second stanza of the Division One league. Saje revealed that the NCS’ aim was not only to win all their matches but also to qualify for the 2020 Nigeria Volleyball Premier League.
 
“Nigeria Correction Service is in Bauchi for serious business… we lost total concentration in the first stanza of the league in Ilorin, but we are here to correct all those mistakes. “Our mission is to win all our matches and eventually qualify for next year’s volleyball premier league. NCS has defeated two of the strongest teams in the league (COAS Spikers and Sunshine Spikers) and I believe the remaining teams should be ready to be beaten,” he boasted Reacting to the loss, the head coach of Kada Stars, Sani Abdullahi said his players would have to correct their mistakes in subsequent games.
 
“We came with a game plan but it did not work against Nigeria Correction Service. My coaching crew will restrategise and effect changes where necessary in the next game,” he said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
