 Iseoluwa Abidemi  Iseoluwa Abidemi, the teenage singer, who was signed in by Wole Oni Music Production (WOMP), is confident this year’s concert is going to be richer and better. The artiste, who hit the scene two years ago with her debut single titled, Iseoluwa, Rababa (2018),  released another single, Mo Ti Goke, this year. “Stars like Wole Oni and others will perform and I believe that the concert will be an awesome experience for people that will attend. I urge people not to miss it,” she said. According to her, “listening to my role models like Asa, my mother, who sings in the choir and other great artistes, I realised that I have a connection with music and I love what I do. The experience has been wonderful and I am grateful to God for blessing me with this talent. It gives me joy to see lives transformed through my music.” Gloria Abidemi, Iseoluwa’s mother, who discovered her daughter’s talent early and supported her all the way, informed that at the concert, Iseoluwa would be launching her new album and foundation that is focused on helping the less privileged and abused children.
