 Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu. Photo/Twitter/GOVONDO  Faboyede, who gave the assurance that the party was putting its house in order ahead of the upcoming election next year, said that the party’s primaries, which will produce the standard-bearer, would be done in a transparent manner. The state PDP chairman disclosed this yesterday when he received the party’s National Vice Chairman (South-West), Eddy Olafeso, who had stormed the party’s secretariat at Alagbaka, Akure, to notify the leadership of the party in the state of his intention to contest the election. He noted that 17 aspirants had signified intention to vie for the party’s ticket and stressed that the process of picking that party’s candidate would be done without rancour.“Our primary will be clean and clear. There will be no brouhaha,” he said. The PDP now has about 17 aspirants. But I can assure everyone that the best candidate will emerge because we will ensure free and fair primaries. “During the last primaries of the party in the state during the general election, we did not receive a single query. The ball is in the court of the delegates to elect a candidate that will be accessible.” Olafeso, who described his move to contest for the governorship seat as a rescue mission to salvage the state from the present administration led by Governor Akeredolu and the APC, said: “There is no government in Ondo State here. This state is the state of Ajasin, it is the state of Adefarati, it the state of Agagu and Mimiko. We are now witnessing a situation where students are paying from primary school level to secondary school. “The tertiary institutions are far beyond the ordinary man. I am a product of the Awolowo era. I would not have been educated if there is no social welfare programme for the ordinary man on the street. They have abdicated their responsibility and they have stepped on the head of history.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
