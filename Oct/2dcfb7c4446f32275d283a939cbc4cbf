Getty Images BBC Music recently placed “Juicy” at the number one spot on their list of the top 25 hip-hop songs of all time. The list was compiled by polling more than 100 critics and experts, including A Tribe Called Quest, Common, and the Wu-Tang Clan. Biggie’s infamous track was released in 1994, as part of his debut album, ‘Ready to Die.’ According to Common, “Juicy” deserves to be at the top of the list. According to Common, “In second was Public Enemy’s 1989 song, “Fight the Power,” followed by “Shook Ones (Part II),” which was released by Mobb Deep in 1995. “All the Lights” by Kanye West and “Alright” by Kendrick Lamar were the only songs from 2010 or later to make the list. BBC Music while explaining what makes ‘Juicy’ greatest hip-hop states that “There’s one song in hip-hop that embodies the culture perfectly. It’s an homage to the past with hope for the future. Steeped in the harsh reality of the streets while being markedly optimistic, it’s the rag-to-riches tale of the hustle – and that’s why it rises to the top of the rap canon” Tapping into his natural storytelling ability, Biggie vividly shares the story of the struggle, of being broke and overlooked. “Born sinner, the opposite of a winner/Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner?” he asks. Sure, he’s flexing his braggadocio, but there’s also touching vulnerability amid the machismo. “Girls used to diss me/Now they write letters ’cause they miss me,” he admits. “Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood/And it’s still all good.” BBC Music further states “There’s a universality in Juicy that enables it to stand the test of time, whether you grew up in the belly of Brooklyn’s Bed-Stuy neighbourhood, or you experience your own daily struggle. Twenty-five years later, Biggie’s uplifting message of perseverance, of better days, still resonates. We don’t have him around anymore, but the aspiration he left behind continues to inspire. And it’s all good.”
