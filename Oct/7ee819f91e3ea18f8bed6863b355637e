Declared by the United Nations in 2011, the International Day of the Girl Child is commemorated once a year on October 11 to recognize girls’ rights and the unique challenges they face around the world. <img class="wp-image-1038456 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/6A7D0A83-EF86-4A86-9BA5-0E8AD89C65BF.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="1600" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/6A7D0A83-EF86-4A86-9BA5-0E8AD89C65BF.jpeg 819w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/6A7D0A83-EF86-4A86-9BA5-0E8AD89C65BF-478x598.jpeg 478w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/6A7D0A83-EF86-4A86-9BA5-0E8AD89C65BF-445x557.jpeg 445w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/6A7D0A83-EF86-4A86-9BA5-0E8AD89C65BF-192x240.jpeg 192w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/6A7D0A83-EF86-4A86-9BA5-0E8AD89C65BF-384x480.jpeg 384w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/6A7D0A83-EF86-4A86-9BA5-0E8AD89C65BF-480x600.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> This year’s theme “GirlForce: Unscripted and unstoppable” focuses on girls breaking boundaries and barriers posed by stereotypes and exclusion. In the last two decades, more girls have transited from dreaming to achieving. More girls today are attending and completing school, fewer are getting married or becoming mothers in their childhood and more are gaining the skills they need to excel in the future world of work. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1038453 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/404737C9-FCB1-4367-B944-A5AA5228B577.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="1279" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/404737C9-FCB1-4367-B944-A5AA5228B577.jpeg 1080w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/404737C9-FCB1-4367-B944-A5AA5228B577-599x598.jpeg 599w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/404737C9-FCB1-4367-B944-A5AA5228B577-100x100.jpeg 100w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/404737C9-FCB1-4367-B944-A5AA5228B577-200x200.jpeg 200w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/404737C9-FCB1-4367-B944-A5AA5228B577-487x487.jpeg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/404737C9-FCB1-4367-B944-A5AA5228B577-974x973.jpeg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/404737C9-FCB1-4367-B944-A5AA5228B577-240x240.jpeg 240w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/404737C9-FCB1-4367-B944-A5AA5228B577-480x480.jpeg 480w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/404737C9-FCB1-4367-B944-A5AA5228B577-600x600.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Every year, the Conversation Café holds a discussion on the Girl Child. This year’s edition is third in the series. The Conversation Café has published “Her”, a 30-minute film focused on the issue of ‘period poverty’ and other real-life societal stories and issues young girls and women face in economically disadvantaged/poor communities in Africa. The Conversation Café team, alongside stakeholders and guest panellists will visit 3 schools in Lagos to screen the movie on the globally-recognized day. The benefiting schools include Holy Child School, Fountain Heights Secondary School and Queensland Academy. Beyond the Day of the Girl Child, the screening of the movie will continue in the days leading to the adoption of this new theme to celebrate the Girl Child and drive the initiative’s goal of reaching millions of girls. Today, and every day, girls should be listened to and empowered with the individual abilities, social support and the resources they need to survive, thrive and transform their communities, even in the most difficult of circumstances. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1038458 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/888F5D1D-B94A-40F4-A41D-B8618A948357.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="1279" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/888F5D1D-B94A-40F4-A41D-B8618A948357.jpeg 1080w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/888F5D1D-B94A-40F4-A41D-B8618A948357-599x598.jpeg 599w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/888F5D1D-B94A-40F4-A41D-B8618A948357-100x100.jpeg 100w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/888F5D1D-B94A-40F4-A41D-B8618A948357-200x200.jpeg 200w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/888F5D1D-B94A-40F4-A41D-B8618A948357-487x487.jpeg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/888F5D1D-B94A-40F4-A41D-B8618A948357-974x973.jpeg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/888F5D1D-B94A-40F4-A41D-B8618A948357-240x240.jpeg 240w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/888F5D1D-B94A-40F4-A41D-B8618A948357-480x480.jpeg 480w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/888F5D1D-B94A-40F4-A41D-B8618A948357-600x600.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />
