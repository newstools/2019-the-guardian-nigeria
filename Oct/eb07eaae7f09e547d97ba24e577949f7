After the conclusion of the 9th Bi-National Commission of South Africa and Nigeria meeting in Pretoria, South Africa, both countries have agreed on issuing 10-year visa to businessmen, academics and frequent travelers. Nigeria’s presidency, in a statement, said the agreement was reached in a meeting co-chaired by Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari and President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, which was the first time both presidents will preside since the Bi-National Commission was elevated. Nigeria’s presidential spokesman Garba Shehu said the decision was taken to encourage citizens of both countries to strengthen their socio-cultural, economic and political relations. At the meeting held at the Union Buildings, Presidential Palace of South Africa, the two presidents agreed on early warning signals to nip violence in the bud before it escalates. Both leaders also took the need to share more intelligence and promote stronger partnership in security into consideration. Both countries also agreed to re-establish the consular forum, which is a structured arrangement where both governments meet regularly, at least twice in a year, to discuss welfare of citizens. Nigerian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama and South African Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Dr Naledi Pandor, signed the minutes of the 9th session of Bi-National Commission. Buhari was on a state visit to South Africa for talks with his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa after violent attacks on Nigerians and other Africans living in the country. The Nigeria President returned to his country Friday, October 4, after a three-day visit to South Africa.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
