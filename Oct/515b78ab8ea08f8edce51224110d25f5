The Governorship candidate of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) in the forthcoming November 16, the election in Kogi State, Engr. Ayodele Raymond Ajibola, debunked the purported endorsement of the All Progressives Congress (APC), candidate, Alhaji Yahaya Bello for the second term in office. Recalled that the media was awash last week that a coalition of 45 political parties had adopted Bello as their preferred candidate for the election in the state. The Chairman of the coalition, Sani Teidi, who announced this at a press conference last Wednesday, in Lokoja, said the parties decided to adopt Bello to boost his re-election bid. It was gathered that 12 of the parties in the coalition are fielding candidates in the election, while 15 others have no candidates. The coalition also included 18 political parties that had earlier voluntarily withdrawn from the election to brighten the chances of Bello in the election. But the PRP candidate, Engr. Ajibola in a chat with journalists, yesterday, said his party was not “and would never be part of any endorsement,” saying he is prepared and ready to square it up with anyone in the forthcoming election. Ajibola noted that he has toiled to emerge, as the candidate of his party, as such, would never trade his credibility for peanut offered to political parties by the ruling APC for the said endorsement.
