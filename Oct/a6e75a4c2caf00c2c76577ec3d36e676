He played a couple of games, maybe played through the pain barrier,” Solskjaer told Sky Sports. “He had a scan after the Arsenal game and maybe needed a few weeks’ rests in a boot so hopefully he won’t be too long, but he won’t make this game, no.” On De Gea, the United manager added: “I think he’ll be out.” United are currently struggling down in 12th place in the table ahead of Sunday’s match at Old Trafford against leaders Liverpool. They have just nine points, 15 behind Liverpool who boasts a perfect record of 24 points from eight games.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
