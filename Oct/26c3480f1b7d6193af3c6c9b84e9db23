The driver of a Nissan Pathfinder SUV on Saturday night lost his life in a lone accident that occurred under the 7-Up/tollgate pedestrian bridge in Lagos State. The incident, which involved three male adults occurred some minutes before 11:00p.m, leaving the driver of the SUV with registration number KJA-729FQ dead and the other two male occupants of the car with various degrees of injuries.

Recalling how it happened, an eyewitness stated that the car arrived the intersection of 7-Up bus stop inward Ojota on top speed when the driver reportedly lost control, as the said vehicle plunged into a ditch under the pedestrian bridge and tumbled in the process. The LASEMA Response Team rescued the other two adult males that sustained serious injuries and they were attended to before being handed over to Lagos State Ambulance Service (LASAMBUS) that moved them to the Trauma Center for further treatment. However, the body of the yet to be identified driver was bagged and handed over to officers of the Nigerian Police from Ketu Police Station for further investigations, just as the vehicle was also recovered off the road to ensure continued free flow of vehicular movement. Meanwhile, another accident occurred at about 6:28a.m yesterday by Mega Chicken, inward Ajah, along Lekki/Epe Expressway, when a Dangote truck while on top speed, lost control, veered off the express and rammed into a stationary truck, which upon impact subsequently collided with a parked Ford Ranger car.
