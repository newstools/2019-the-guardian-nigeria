• Tasks agencies on transparency, patriotism The Civil Society Tax Compliance Group has given the assurances that the introduction of property, expensive car taxes will not only boost the revenue base of government at all levels, but also go a long way to check unnecessary affluent lifestyles by Nigerians. The group, at a sensitisation workshop in Abuja, further said the revenue to be derived from such collections would contribute to the federal government’s economic diversification drive, grow local industries and create massive employment for the people.It however charged the tax agencies to be more patriotic and transparent by embracing accountability for the overall development of the country. The tax compliance sensitisation civil society workshop, organised in collaboration with the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), aims at economic rejuvenation, and promotion of the culture of tax compliance among the citizenry.Speaking to the one-day advocacy workshop, yesterday, the Director, Civil Society Group for Good Governance, Ogukwu Dominic, stressed the need for the introduction of property and expensive car tax in Nigeria. He said: “The need for government to begin to collect property and expensive car tax is one of the reasons for this sensitisation workshop. This is because there are several properties lying idle across major city centres in Nigeria, if government takes it upon itself to collect tax from these properties, including taxes on expensive cars, several billions would be generated for government to spend on decayed infrastructure, create more local industries and generate employment for the people.”He assured that the group has concluded arrangement to go ahead and monitor such taxes collection, to ensure they are properly used for the development of the nation. Speaking on the theme, “Assessing the transparency, measures emplaced by the Federal Inland Revenue Service for efficiency in tax collection, accounting, and further promote tax compliance among the citizenry,” the Executive Director, Vision One Leadership Development Initiative (VOLDI), Emmanuel Johnny, said the group wants to see a modern Nigeria that works. He continued, “We must tell ourselves the truth, we must pay tax, we must stay away from relying on oil revenues. Our country will only develop if we pay our taxes as at when due; FIRS should begin to build man power, and maximise resources. This sensitisation should be taken to the grassroots so that people will pay tax and encourage even growth and development.”Earlier in a goodwill message, the Executive Secretary, Joint Tax Board, Oseni Elamah, said there is a compelling need to educate the people through massive enlightenment and sensitisation programmes. This is aimed at creating awareness on the principles of tax and taxation, the respective tax laws, their applicability and the expected obligations of the taxpayer towards achieving a tax-friendly environment.Elamah, represented by Dr. Ja’afaru Mohammed, said: “This kind of workshop would re-orient the public to make them aware of the relationship that exists between taxpayers and the state, which is underpinned by expectation of government accountability, inclusiveness, and a state apparatus that is equitable and fair to all.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
