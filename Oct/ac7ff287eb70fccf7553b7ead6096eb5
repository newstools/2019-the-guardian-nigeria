Simpson went on to share that dating Cyrus is a “different experience” for him, as the pair were friends first. “The reason why it hasn’t been a really crazy sudden thing is just because we’ve been friends for so long,” he said, explaining that they “found each other again in a space where we’re both not partying, working real hard, and it just keeps things healthy and it’s good.” Simpson added, “Any girlfriends I’ve had in the past has always been immediate romance and so it’s a different experience having been friends with somebody before and it developing naturally into something more.”
