  Odom struggled to remember his dance routines on the show due to memory problems stemming from his near-fatal overdose. The star and his partner, Peta Murgatroyd, were voted off the competition on Monday. Odom admitted that he'd struggled more than viewers may have realized. While Odom would have liked to progress further in the competition, he's keeping a positive attitude and focusing on other work. In 2015, Odom was found unconscious at a Nevada brothel following an overdose, which left him in a coma. A year later, he checked into rehab to deal with drug addiction issues.
