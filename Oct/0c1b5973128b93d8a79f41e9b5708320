Photo Credit: SA-Hip-Hop Mag One month after the Xenophobic attack in South Africa, Nigerian recording artiste Burna Boy is set to perform in the Southern African country. South African news outlet, IOL reports that Burna Boy would be headlining the African Unite concert scheduled to hold in Cape Town and Tshwane next month. However, reacting to this news, South African rapper AKA dares Burna Boy to make true a threat the “Ye” crooner had made during the Xenophobic attacks. “I would love to attend this show and watch this man put his hands on me in my own country.” AKA tweeted. In the peak of the attacks on Nigerians and other African nationals in South Africa, Burna Boy, in a now-deleted tweet threatened to deal with AKA next time their paths crossed: “And @akaworldwide I knew you was retarded but I didn’t know it had gotten this bad. Next time I see you you better have a big security bro, On Gambos Grave ur gunna need it.” He later vowed not to set his foot ever in the country, except a miracle happened: “I personally have had my own xenophobic experiences at the hands of South Africans and because of that….. “I have not set foot in SA since 2017. And I will NOT EVER go to South Africa again for any reason until the SOUTH AFRICAN government wakes the fuck up and really performs A miracle because I don’t know how they can even possibly fix this,” <img class="wp-image-1049070 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Capture.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="578" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Capture.jpg 744w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Capture-487x220.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Capture-320x145.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Capture-640x289.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Capture-600x271.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> IOL also reported that Jidenna, who is currently on tour promoting his 85 To Africa album, will be performing at the concert.
