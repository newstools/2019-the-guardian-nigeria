Adeniyi spoke at the weekend while addressing the Senator Ali Ndume-led Joint Committee on Army and Defence at the Maimalari Cantonment, Maiduguri. “The dream of Boko Haram for a caliphate in Borno and Yobe states has been dashed with the increased number of insurgents being killed monthly,” he said, assuring the committee members that none of the towns would fall into the hands of the terrorists again. He continued: “One thing I want to assure the chairmen, distinguished lawmakers and the entire country of is that the prophecies of doom about how the towns in northern Borno will fall would not happen. “Please tell them in Abuja that not a single town will fall under me. I promised Nigerians when I took over the command seven weeks ago that I am going to take the fight to the Boko Haram terrorists. “Officers and men in the command have seriously supported me with the help of the service headquarters.” According to him, “all the towns that usually fall during the dry season are standing, and doing well.” He said the troops were tested and in capable hands.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
