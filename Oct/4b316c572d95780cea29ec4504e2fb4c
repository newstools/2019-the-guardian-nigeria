• Match Starts At 1pm Nigeria time Super Eagles Coach, Gernot Rohr, has refuted claims that he plans to dump the male senior national team.The German-French coach, who is in Singapore, as Eagles take on the Samba Boys in today’s friendly game, slammed the rumour circulating in the social media, as baseless. While saying he was preparing the team for the 2021 Total Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers against Benin Republic and Lesotho, the Super Eagles sweat merchant said: “The game against Brazil will show how much we are progressing after finishing third at the Africa Cup in Egypt. It is a fantastic opportunity for us to learn a few more things that will make us better and stronger for future challenges. “This is an important test game for us, and we are here to learn from the best. We hope for a very good game against Brazil on Sunday (today). This will help us prepare ourselves for the 2021 AFCON qualifiers against Benin Republic and Lesotho next month,” Rohr said. Meanwhile, Eagles defender, William Ekong, has said the clash against Brazil will be tough, but expressed confidence that his teammates are up to the task. “Brazil is a top team, probably the best team in the world. But Senegal gave them a good fight on Thursday. We can pick some inspiration from that performance when we play the Brazilians on Sunday (today). “It will be tough because they want to win at least one game against an African team on this tour, but we will also want to take something off them.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
