According to Omosebi, FAO works with its partners to provide agriculture inputs, which include cereal seed such as millet, sorghum, and maize. He said others were legumes and oilseed, such as cowpea, groundnut, sesame and vegetable seeds, amaranths and okra taking into consideration the preference of beneficiary farmers and the agro-ecological zone. He expressed appreciation to FAO for not just giving them the seeds, but also the timeliness of the intervention and extra efforts put into training them on best farming practices and fertilizer application and other relevant extension services. Also speaking, a beneficiary, Alhaji Lawal Isa in General Hospital IDP Camp in Damboa central of Damboa Local Government said before FAO intervention, his family used to plant only vegetables, which earned only N15, 000 that was not enough to take care of his family, but with the intervention he has been able to get farm inputs and fertilizers.
