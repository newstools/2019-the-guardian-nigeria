The Federal University Oye Ekiti (FUOYE), Ekiti State, said it has tackled challenges of infrastructure deficit in the institution by partnering sister universities who have such facilities. Dean of the Post Graduate School, Prof. Ojo Bakare, who disclosed this, said in less than eight years of existence, the school is well equipped to offer one of the best postgraduate educations in the country. He said at a time, the institution waited for the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) alone to provide facilities needed, but when the current Vice Chancellor, Prof. Kayode Soremekun came, coupled with expansion in population of students, he was able to generate more Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) to spport the provision of facilities, classrooms and to sustain the expansion. Bakare revealed that the institution would graduate its first postgraduate (Masters) set before the end of the year. “Some of our Masters students must have graduated by year end because we have mechanisms to make sure that nobody’s time is wasted, except the candidate is not serious, otherwise they will finish at the right time. “For programmes in Humanities and Liberal Arts, the students can finish in12 months and if you are able to complete your course works and write your dissertation, we would allow you to face the External Examiners and if you pass, you go. For those in the sciences and Technology-based programmes, it is 18 months. So it is left in the hands of students because we make sure that on the part of the lecturers, nobody should waste anybody’s time.” He said the institution has blazed the trail as the first of nine universities co-established that has successfully commenced a full-blown Post Graduate Programme (PGP), at both the Masters and Ph.D levels. “We now run PG in 30 programmes, following last week’s approval by the National Universities Commission (NUC) of fresh six programmes.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
