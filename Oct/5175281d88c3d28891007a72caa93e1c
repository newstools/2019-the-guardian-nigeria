Romelu Lukaku was just about to take a penalty when the incident occurred with the Inter Milan striker going on to convert for a 3-1 lead for the visitors. Broadcaster DAZN did not show images during the live broadcast of the match but the photos soon went viral on social medial in Italy. The parachutist was quickly evacuated by security agents at the stadium in Emilia-Romagna. Braces from both former Manchester United striker Lukaku and Lautaro Martinez sealed a 4-3 win for Inter, who stay second in the Italian league one point behind leaders Juventus. Domenico Beradi (16), Filip Djuricic (74) and Jeremie Boga (81) all scored for the home side who are 16th after their fifth loss of the season.
