According to court documents, obtained by the New York Post newspaper’s Page Six column, “Williams must pay Hunter $250,000 so that he can secure new living arrangements” after he was told he must vacate their marital home in Livingston, New Jersey, after it was put up for sale over the summer. Wendy, who is currently renting an apartment in New York for $15,000 a month filed for divorce from Kevin in April following allegations he cheated on her and had a baby. She said recently: “Infidelity is one thing, a full baby is a whole other topic. It’s now time for me to move on with my life … I’m not changing Pampers, I want to be pampered! If we don’t laugh, then we’ll cry. So, I’ve learned how to, from my mother, how to make lemons into lemonade. What am I supposed to do? Stay in the house and cry all day?”
