•Bauchi House seeks more attention for rural roads
The Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations, Jubrin Barau, has reiterated his panel’s determination to meet the deadline for the submission of its report to the whole house. Senate President Ahmad Lawan had on Tuesday mandated the committee to submit a detailed budget for consideration on November 28.Barau said the fact that some standing committees were still having engagements with federal ministries, departments and agencies would not hinder his panel from meeting the deadline. His words: “We have started receiving and considering reports from various committees and we would meet up with the November 28 given to us to lay our report.”However, Lawan has vowed to lead the ninth National Assembly in a manner that the rights of every Nigerian are protected. Granting audience to international ombudsman leaders who visited him yesterday in Abuja, he said the upper legislative chamber would ensure that the budget for the human rights commission was conscientiously considered.He noted that it was expedient for the citizens to feel they are appreciated and patriotic to support government in all its programmes for the development of the country. Lawan expressed joy that the ombudsman member-nations were bringing justice, stability and fairness to the institutions they lead.The senate president observed that the public complaints commission in Nigeria was recognised by law as the country’s ombudsman body, adding that there were other bodies like the traditional rulers that also play important roles in the peaceful co-existence among the citizens. Meanwhile, the Bauchi House of Assembly has charged Governor Bala Mohammed to include mass construction of rural roads in his 2020 fiscal budget to foster accessibility of agriculture produce for the health of the state’s economy of the State.The resolution followed a motion moved in that respect by the speaker, Abubakar Suleiman.
