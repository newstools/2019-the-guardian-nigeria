We reported earlier that three female on-air-personalities (OAP) at City FM were caught on camera mocking Nigerian music star, Tiwa Savage. The sensational songstress had visited the radio station as part of her radio tour for an interview and after she left, the three OAPs talked about her not writing her own songs and profiting off other peopleâ€™s songs. In their conversation, they also insinuated that Yemi Alade is a better artist than Tiwa Savage. She reacted to the video by sharing it online and also telling them that she hopes they are able to keep the same energy when they see her in person. The Nigerian social media space especially microblogging platform, Twitter has since gone into a frenzy following the release of the video.
