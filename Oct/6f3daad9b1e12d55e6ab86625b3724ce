Commissions 149-bed mother, child centre in Lagos
Wife of the President, Mrs. Aisha Buhari, yesterday said that the Federal Government’s zero-tolerance declaration for maternal mortality had paid off, as the welfare of women and children are currently being given priority attention by President Muhammadu Buhari-led government. Mrs. Buhari, who spoke in Lagos at the official launch of the 149-Bed Maternal and Child Centre in Alimosho, Lagos, said the need to consolidate government’s effort informed why she is constructing maternity complexes across the country. “The essence of this is to ensure that women receive attention while they are pregnant and deliver their babies in most hygienic environment,” she said. Also, Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu said the state government did not pay lip service to issue of quality healthcare delivery.He said the facility nestled in the biggest local council in the country would serve the population very well. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Mrs. Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire, said the facility would help to reduce maternal and infant mortality and morbidity rate and general improvement in all maternal and child health indices in the Council.She added that the ultra-modern facility would complement the existing maternal and child centre as a secondary referral centre to the Primary Healthcare Centres (PHC) and private hospitals. In his address, the Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Akin Abayomi, said the commissioning was another milestone in the state’s efforts towards improving the health indices of its citizenry.
