A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr. Kunle Somorin, said the money was raised through the State Security Trust Fund committee set up by Governor Dapo Abiodun. Abiodun had while assuming office, set up the committee to raise funds for the procurement of security equipment for security agencies in the state. The governor noted that the state was vulnerable to criminal attacks as a result of its location and proximity to three other states, including Lagos and a neighbouring country. Ogun State, the governor added, is also fast-becoming an industrial hub with an increase in economic and commercial activities. He also mentioned cross border migration, as well as the state harbouring the busiest highway in the country, as another major attraction to criminality. He stressed the need for all stakeholders to be involved in security issues. Abiodun, who decried lack of communication system for security agencies in the state, noting that it had stalled proper communication between security chiefs in the state, said: “We need more equipment; we do not have any telecommunication equipment. We need monitoring and tracking devices because it is these monitoring and tracking devices that we can monitor and track these criminals. “It is shameful that our security agencies do not have a communication system or equipment within the state, meaning that the commissioner of police cannot speak with his counterparts in the military, Department of State Services (DSS) or even worse still, he cannot speak with his Area Commander and Divisional Police Officers (DPOs) of police stations across the state. “Their vehicles were not functioning very well; no tracking devices, no enough finance, so, we are looking at correcting those anomalies with our security trust fund.” He pleaded with the corporate bodies and other stakeholders to join hands with the government in addressing challenges poised by insecurity, saying that security matter should be the responsibility of all, as the government could not do it alone. He assured investors that funds realised through the security trust fund would be judiciously used with the board having “people with integrity and a name to protect.” Abiodun said the decision to launch ‘Amotekun’ by the five South-West states was meant to ensure the security of the entire region.
