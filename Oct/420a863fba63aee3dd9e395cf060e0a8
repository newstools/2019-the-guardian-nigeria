If you are looking for a lazy baker, look no further, I am the definition of a very lazy baker. I like pastries, however, if I have to bake them ( which I know how to do very well) then it means I’m expecting special visitors over at my house or whatever I’m baking does not include a mixer and too much measuring, just like this lovely banana bread recipe below. No need for a mixer, prepping is very easy and clean up isn’t a buzzkill at all! In fact, if you want, you can mix everything in one bowl. How cool is that? PS the best bananas to use for banana bread are over-ripe bananas. The ones that are very soft and the peels are already browning out, Yes! Those ones, DO NOT THROW THEM AWAY! Use them, revamp them, turn them into banana bread and watch the people around you thank you for it. INGREDIENTS Method 1 Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C), and butter or spray your loaf pan with baking spray. 2 In a large bowl, mash ripe bananas with a fork or a masher until the bananas are completely smooth. Stir the melted butter into the mashed bananas, if you are using cooking or vegetable oil, make sure you are careful not to put too much. I prefer to use melted butter instead as it makes my banana bread very moist. 3 Mix in baking soda and a very tiny pinch of salt. Stir in sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. Stir well then mix in the flour. 4 Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Bake for about an hour at 350°F (175°C), or until you insert a toothpick or tester into the centre and it comes out clean. If the tester or toothpick comes out wet, then it means you need to put the banana bread back into the oven for maybe an additional 15 to 20 minutes. 5 Remove from the oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then remove the banana bread from the pan and let cool completely before serving. Slice and serve your delicious banana bread.
