A tweet on the Nigeria Football Federation’s (NFF’s) official handle on Sunday night said Solomon-Otabor has been called-up by Rohr as replacement for the injured Samuel Kalu. It is the first time Solomon-Otabor has been invited to the Super Eagles. “Viv Efosa Solomon-Otabor of PFC CSKA Sofia, Bulgaria, has been called up by Coach Gernot Rohr to replace injured Bordeaux winger, Samuel Kālu, for the Oct. 13 friendly against Brazil in Singapore,” the NFF tweeted. Kalu picked up an injury in training with his French club, Bordeaux, and missed Saturday’s 3-1 away loss at Toulouse as a result of the setback. Solomon-Otabor, 23, has featured in seven league games for CSKA Sofia this season. Rohr had earlier named Tyronne Ebuehi as a replacement for Leganes of Spain defender, Kenneth Omeruo.
