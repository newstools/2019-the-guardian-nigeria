Chairman of Degema Local Government Area of Rivers State, Dr. Tony Philmoore has emphasised the need for self-development and discipline as a panacea for the development of golf in Nigeria. Speaking on Tuesday at the 2019/2020 PGA of Nigeria Qualifying School Seminar holding in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Philmoore, who was the chairman of the occasion, in his lecture on Golf Professionalism and Self Development, said golfers could get the best out of every seemingly bad situation. “As people, who are aspiring to become professionals in this noble profession, there is nothing stopping you from developing yourself academically to be among the best in other professions in the society. “You can development yourself to a degree level; masters level and even PhD level. That’s one of the ways you can make yourself relevant in the scheme of things,” he admonished. But the speaker, who said it must not be all academics, also counseled that achieving such lofty height was largely dependent on the professionals’ disciplinary level. “A professional that wants to achieve results and progress must have a good character and that is the hallmark of life – you must humble yourself and you will be exulted in your endeavours,” he said. Philmoore adjudged the seminar as the best of PGA of Nigeria Qualifying School seminars in recent times, giving the large turnout of the trainees. Other speakers of the day were Mr. Patrick, Okpomu, Head Resident Pro, Port Harcourt Golf Club and Mr. Bello Seibidor, the Assistant Resident Pro, who dwelled on the etiquette of the game. On Wednesday, the event took the trainees to practicals at the Port Harcourt Golf Course. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
