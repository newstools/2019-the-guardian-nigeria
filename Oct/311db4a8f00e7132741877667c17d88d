Angelina and Maddox Angelina Jolie was heartbroken last month when her 18-year-old son started at Yonsei University in South Korea, however, she is, counting down the days until she can be reunited with him again as he is flying to the East Asian country to see her. According to Extra, “He’s flying to meet me in Japan. So I am two days from my hug … He’s great. I know he’s solid, he’s fine, but I need it.” Maddox is studying biochemistry at the private research university in Seoul and the ‘The Tourist’ star can’t believe how “great” he’s doing on the intense course. Maddox is the first adopted child of Jolie. On March 10, 2002, Jolie adopted her first child, seven-month-old Maddox Chivan, from an orphanage in Battambang, Cambodia. He was born as Rath Vibol on August 5, 2001, in a local village. She also adopted some of her other children as well and the bond between the actress and the children is so strong. Watching Maddox leave for Japan got her heart-broken and seeing him after two weeks is what she looks forward to. Angelina – who has Maddox, Pax, 15, Zahara, 14, Shiloh, 13, and 11-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne with her ex-husband Brad Pitt – feels like she’s on a new wave of life now that her children are slightly older and are spreading their wings.
