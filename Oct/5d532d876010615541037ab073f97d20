National chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, has said that the party has no hand in the recent appointment of Supreme Court justices. Interacting with Bayelsa State stakeholders of the party yesterday, he expressed optimism that the apex court would uphold the election of President Muhammadu Buhari. Oshiomhole, who accused the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of dragging the judiciary in the mud to score political points, also distanced himself from posters in parts of the country tipping him as APC vice presidential candidate in 2023. He reiterated his party’s commitment towards delivery of democracy dividends to Nigerians.Said he, “I want to completely dissociate myself and members of our party from all those posters. We believe that these are the handwork of PDP who think that they can create suspicion within the rank of APC.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
