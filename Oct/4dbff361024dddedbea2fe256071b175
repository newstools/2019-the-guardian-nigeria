A non-governmental organization, Yoruba Indigenes’ Foundation (YIF) has sealed a pact with an United Nations agency to send back to school some youths, popularly called Area Boys, who had dropped out of school and took to life on the streets dispossessing citizens of their personal belongings in Lagos.
  
This was disclosed by president of the foundation, Dr. Olumide Aderibole, at a media parley tagged ‘Hosanle return to school,’ as part of the foundation’s mission to eradicate miscreants from the communities.
  
He told The Guardian that the initiative bagan at Ikotun bus-stop, which saw about 200 area boys also called Hosanle, gather to obtain forms with their family members that would give them the opportunity to start school in public schools, with their school fees, books and other materials taken care of.  Chairman, Igando-Ikotun Local Council Development Area (LCDA), Mrs. Morenike Williams, lauded the initiative, saying young people should be allowed to participate in developing ideas and add their quota to the development of the country, as they are a veritable positive force for social change.
   
She urged the youths to channel their energies towards positive things rather than constituting nuisance to the society. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
