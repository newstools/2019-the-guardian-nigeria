Nigeria Senate on Thursday revisited the bill to upgrade the College of Technology, Yaba, Lagos to a university. The bill was presented by Senator Yayi Adeola, who represents Lagos West Senatorial District, during the plenary session. He also advocated the change of the institution’s name to City University of Technology, Yaba. The bill was first sponsored by Senator Gbenga Ashafa who represented Lagos East in the 8th Senate. Ashafa said Nigeria’s steady march towards education for all in the shortest possible time had taken a giant leap with the introduction of this Bill for Act to provide for the establishment of the City University of Technology, Yaba, and other related matters. He said the prospect of transforming the polytechnic to a university of technology would upgrade its facilities and enhance its capability to achieve its objectives. Besides, he said it would relate its activities to the social, cultural and economic needs of the people of Nigeria and undertakes any other activities appropriate for a university of the highest standards. It was approved by the Bukola Saraki-led Senate but President Muhammadu Buhari did not sign it into law. Ibrahim Gobri, who represented Sokoto East Senatorial District, said Yabatech’s existence has contributed so much to the development of the country and thus deserved an upgrade in status. However, Muhammad Aliero, the senator that represented Kebbi Central said the bill was not asking for a new university but simply the upgrading of the college to a full-fledged university and should be granted.
