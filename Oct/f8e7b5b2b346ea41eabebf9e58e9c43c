 Wild Conservation Society (WCS) officials installing the tracking system  According to him, with the focused law enforcement efforts and community engagement programmes, no elephant has been killed in Yankari since 2015, bringing previously high poaching levels down to a very low level over the past four years, with zero poaching incidences detected.  Also, the Regional Director of WCS’s Sudano-Sahel Programme, Dr. Paul Elkan said:  “Real-time monitoring of elephant populations is essential for their protection by providing location data which is used to optimize deployment of anti-poaching and other wildlife protection interventions and also to help improve efforts to reduce elephant human conflict with neighboring communities”. He added that at various protected area landscape sites across Africa where WCS is engaged in management partnerships with Governments and local
communities, they have employed use of GPS/satellite collars, combined with ground based anti poaching patrols, aerial monitoring, and real time law enforcement management to secure elephant populations.
 
For WCS Landscape Director in Yankari Game Reserve and Resort, Nachamada Geoffrey, “the use of satellite collars has also allowed us to react more quickly whenever elephants stray outside the reserve, and has helped reduce levels of crop damage and human-elephant conflict. We manage the information on elephant locations with strict confidentiality to ensure their safety at all times.”On his part, the Chief Veterinarian on the project,  Dr Richard Harvey disclosed that “the elephants were in good condition, with animals of various ages and plenty of juveniles and calves. The herd is reproducing well, which is great news for the future of elephants, and for the Yankari ecosystem overall.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
