 Former Bayern Munich Ghanaian player Samuel Kuffour (C) and fellow members of the Normalisation Comitee sit onstage during the Ghana Football Association (GFA) president’s election at the Physicians and Surgeons Centre in Accra on October 25, 2019. – The position of GFA’s president has been vacant since the corruption scandal that erupted on June 2018 where various members of the organisation were caught taking bribes on a special documentary by the investigative Ghanaian journalist, Anas Aremeyaw Anas.

Okraku got the nod from the 120 delegates after beating former FA vice president George Afriyie at the second round of voting. The expose by journalist Anas Aremeyaw Anas rocked football in Ghana and led to the creation of a “normalisation committee” to lead reforms in the FA before a new president could be chosen. Ghana’s government said the revelations in 2018 had exposed “gross malfunctioning… characterised by widespread fraud, corruption, and bribery” at the country’s FA. Nyantakyi was banned from football for life by the sport’s world governing body FIFA last October after being found guilty of bribery and corruption. The sting also saw a string of referees banned for life in Ghana and football officials in a number of other African countries sanctioned.
