I look forward to getting healthy and hope to be back here in Shenzhen next year,” she added. Osaka had started the $14 million round-robin tournament with a tough three-set victory over Petra Kvitova on Sunday to extend her winning streak to 11 matches after titles in Beijing and Osaka. She had been determined to make amends for a disappointing WTA Finals debut last year, when her winless campaign ended with her retiring in tears against Kiki Bertens due to a hamstring injury. World number 10 Bertens will replace Osaka for the remaining matches and plays Barty in Red Group action on Tuesday.
