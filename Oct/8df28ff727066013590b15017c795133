Defending champions of the ongoing Zenith Bank Women’s Basketball League, First Bank Basketball Club of Lagos and Mountain of Fire Ministry’s basketball team were in devastating form yesterday, as the hostilities began in the Atlantic Conference of the competition. MFM was so super at the Liberty Stadium, Ibadan, where they whipped Oluyole Angels 91 to 24 in one of the opening day games of the league, just as First Bank also dispatched Ogun Angels 101 to 50 in a largely one-sided encounter. The two results did not come as a surprise because of the prowess of the two teams in the competition. First Bank did not only win the league last year, but they are also the best and most consistent team in the competition, which is in its 15th edition with the huge support from Zenith Bank. On the other hand, MFM is still new, since they only joined the league last term, but they finished fourth after losing the third-place match in the Final Eight competition on their debut campaign in Lagos. MFM coach, Aderemi Adewunmi said the conference stage was a bigger task and his girls were focused to play in the Final Eight again this time. “We are focused to play in the Finals where we also intend to compete and do well. But for now, we must continue to work hard and confirm our place in finals slated for Lagos,” Coach Adewunmi said.
