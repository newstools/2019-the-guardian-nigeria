The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described as “repressive the decision of the Federal Government to impose a N5000 fee for renewal of the national identity cards.” In a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party said that the “very idea of ID card fee by the President Muhammadu Buhari administration is reprehensible and completely offensive to the sensibilities of Nigerians as free citizens.” The main opposition party maintained that imposing “such unwarranted and unjustified levy on Nigerians for internal social safety instrument amounts to wicked fleecing as well as stripping of their constitutional rights in their own nation.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
