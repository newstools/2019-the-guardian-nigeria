 President Buhari  The Kaduna chapter chairman of the association, Reverend Joseph Hayab, urged the government to review its economic policies and programmes for the development of the nation. He told reporters yesterday in his independence message in Kaduna that previous administrations had set agenda on the nation’s path to socio-economic and political growth. Hayab submitted: “Today, the country has been bedeviled by ethno-religious conflicts and other security challenges that President (Muhammadu) Buhari should immediately resolve if the government will take Nigeria to the next level of economic stability in the remaining years of his administration. “We have refused to grow. Because the speed we ought to be growing is too slow. The speed with which we have gone backward under the present government has made us lose all our gains since independence. Our leadership has not improved. Today in Nigeria, leaders are still talking about the stories we heard decades ago.” The CAN chairman insisted: “The countries that are supposed our contemporaries took resources from our country years ago and they developed them, and today they are far ahead of us. The things we borrowed or got from them are dead here. Can we really say that our leaders have been patriotic to see our country grow? No, they are not! “Rather, the leaders are today whipping up ethnoreligious sentiments to divide us for their selfish interest.” On return of the nation to the economic renaissance, Hayab submitted: “The first thing that is of paramount importance now is how to unite the country. “We have always said that no society can develop or grow in the face of confusion or rancour. What we have not been able to achieve, as Nigerians are to unite this country. Up till now, the people don’t see themselves as Nigerians. And you don’t blame them because of the attitude of some of our leaders.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
