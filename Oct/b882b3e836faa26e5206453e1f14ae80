The 10-man committee constituted by the Taraba State Governor, Arch. Darius Ishaku has urged all concerned in the Benue-Taraba States crisis to follow the path of peace to bring a lasting solution to the lingering crisis between Tiv/Jukun tribes. Leader of the delegation, Chief Teghtegh Shaakaa, who made the call, in a statement, yesterday, said their mission in Benue was to brief the paramount ruler, His Royal Majesty, Tor Tiv, Professor James Ayatse on the peace process between the warring tribes so far. The governor had earlier constituted a 30-man committee on Tiv/Jukun crisis that offered out some resolutions among which were a call for immediate cessation of hostilities on both sides; dismantling illegal roadblocks; deployment of heavy security to all trouble spots for safe return of displaced persons and call to the displaced to return to their ancestral homes.
