Director-General of NECA, Mr Timothy Olawale The Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association (NECA) has said that the gains of the country’s independence remain consistently hindered by anti-development conditions such as poor governance, prevalent corruption, high cost of governance, security challenges and rent seeking amongst many other vices. The association argued that though Nigeria since independence witnessed varied developmental efforts and outcomes, ranging from significant political developments, economic policy milestones and development in human capital, it however, noted that the positive growth and viable economy has been hindered by bad leadership. NECA in its message on the anniversary of Nigeria’s independence said that for the country to regain its past glory, government at all levels should develop strategies in partnering with the private sector in stimulating the economy as well as make a dent on unemployment, poverty and addressing the nation’s infrastructure deficiency. The Director-General of NECA, Timothy Olawale, said the three tiers of government should be deliberate about the provision of enabling environment for businesses to thrive. He noted that the resilience of the Nigerian economy, however, led to growth in different sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, transportation and information technology among others, which has propelled the economy into a viable emerging economy with relatively stable exchange rate, fairly predictable macroeconomic environment and good prospects for growth.
