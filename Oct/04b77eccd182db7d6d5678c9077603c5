Nigeriaâ€™s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Thursday said it has secured the conviction of one Joseph Oyediran, a suspect indicted by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) in the United States of America. Justice Mahmood Abdulgafar of Kwara State High Court convicted and sentenced Oyediran to one-year imprisonment after he relied on all the documents tendered and evidence presented by the EFCC. The commission had earlier arraigned the convict on a five count charge. Oyediran pleaded not guilty but later approached the EFCC for a plea bargain agreement. He was, however, been sentenced to one-year imprisonment. Consequently, a plot of land located at Wara, behind Ilorin West Local Government Secretariat and the sum of N800,000 recovered from Oyediran was forfeited to the Nigerian government.
