Thankfully for him, Bernard’s incredible skill in the first half followed by Gylfi Sigurdsson’s stunner in stoppage time sealed the three points. Iwobi said: “The manager told us after the international break that we had to be confident, to not feel any sort of pressure. “He said, ‘Just play and express yourselves and be free’. We took that into training and you can see from the players today, we were able to that in the match.” Iwobi was rated as one of the most influential players in the game against West Ham and Everton fans pray he keeps delivering the goods. The win on Saturday took Everton out of the relegation zone and pushed them up to 14th in the league table. The Toffees had a ton of chances to increase the margin of victory against a disappointing Hammers side but the lack of confidence in recent games possibly played a part in the finishing. Silva will no doubt be pleased with his side’s performance but he will know that there is a lot of room for improvement in the coming weeks. Everton travel to the Amex next to take on Graham Potter’s Brighton who are just a point behind the Toffees and any hiccup there could see them return to the bottom three.
