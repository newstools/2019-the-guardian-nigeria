Gospel singer, Benita Okojie, and husband, Olawale Adeyina, last Saturday announced the arrival of their second child, a baby girl. The celebrated couple walked down the aisle sometime in 2016 and had a son before the new addition. Elated Benita shared the pictures and wrote: “The Lord has blessed us with a Princess, Araoluwa Eden Adeyina. Only Jesus could have done it. “The whole process was indeed a miracle. God hears! He is still doing wonders. God gave us a major testimony and we are eternally grateful!” Recall, Benita became popular at age 10 when she released her first single courtesy of her parents, titled Osamudiame.
