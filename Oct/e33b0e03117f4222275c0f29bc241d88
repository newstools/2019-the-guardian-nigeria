Kalu said that birth registration was compulsory, continuous, permanent and universal and urged parents to ensure they register their children. The NPC official also advised residents to register the dead, describing the figure recorded for death certificates for the period under review as “nothing to write home about.” “Getting a death certificate is equally as important as birth certificate, as this would enable persons concerned to access the benefits of the deceased. “People must ensure that they come forward to register the death of their loved ones so that death certificate could be issued to family of the deceased,” the NPC official said.
