Kanye West Finally Releases “Jesus Is King” | Photo: Def Jam Records Though it arrived a little later than scheduled, American rapper Kanye West eventually made true his promise to drop his new album, “Jesus Is King”. The long awaited album was released following a series of delays. West had promised in a tweet to release the album by midnight on Friday, but the hour came and went without an album.  Early Friday morning, West tweeted an explanation, sharing that they were still fine-tuning some tracks. “To my fans, thank you for being loyal & patient,” he wrote. “We are specifically fixing mixes on ‘Everything We Need’ ‘Follow God’ & ‘Water.’ We not going to sleep until this album is out!” “Jesus Is King” was initially set for a Sept 27 release which was announced by Kim Kardashian on August 29 in an Instagram post in which she shared a tracklist of the album.  On September 27, the album didn’t drop. Kardashian, however, posted an updated tracklist of the album with the caption “Have Faith”. Subsequent posts claimed the album would drop on September 29. On September 29, West held an event he reported debuted clips from the accompanying documentary and played music from the new album. The album release coincide with the release of the accompanying IMAX film “Jesus Is King”. The film was directed by Nick Knight and filmed in James Turrell’s large-scale artwork, the Roden Crater, in the desert of northern Arizona. In a Thursday interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music’s “Beats 1”, West revealed that he has yet another project in the works called “Jesus Is Born,” set to release on Christmas.
