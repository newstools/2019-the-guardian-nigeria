Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) said it raided a nightclub in Osogbo, notorious for hosting parties for suspected internet fraudsters. EFCC spokesman Wilson Uwujaren in a statement said the raid led to the arrest of 94 suspects and confiscation of 19 exotic cars, laptops, scores of mobile phones and other items. Uwajuren said the night club known as ‘Club Secret Underground’, the nightclub is located on the Ibadan-Iwo Expressway in the Osun State capital. The EFCC spokesman said the operation was a followup to an intelligence report that the suspected internet fraudsters were having a party to celebrate their loots. “A discreet operation on the club had earlier been carried out to ascertain the authenticity of the intelligence,” Uwajuren said. “The confirmation led to the mega raid effected on Monday.” Uwujaren said an investigation was ongoing to charge the indicted suspects to court.
