Iggy Azalea and TI Iggy Azalea accuses T.I. of being a ‘Misogynist’ in a series of now-deleted tweets. Iggy Azalea slammed her former mentor for being a “huge misogynist.” Her outburst is in response to a recent T.I. interview with ‘The Root,’ in which he described Iggy as his “biggest blunder.” According to The Independent, Rapper T.I., who is also known as Tip Harris, told The Root earlier this week that he was “still actively looking for another female rapper who can undo the blunder of Iggy Azalea”. “That is the tarnish of my legacy as far as being a music executive is concerned,” he continued. “To me, this is like when Michael Jordan went to play baseball.” In since-deleted tweets, Azalea rejected the claims, writing: “Imagine thinking I was his biggest blunder lmaoooooooooooooo. Tip. Sweetie. We have a whole list for you.” She added, “The tea I could spill on what bulls*** this is but at the end of the day I think people can see it’s clear he’s salty. “He’s a huge misogynist and has never been able to have a conversation with any woman in which he doesn’t speak like a fortune cookie.”
