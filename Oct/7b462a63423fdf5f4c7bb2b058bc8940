The Rock Splurges $9 Million On Luxury Home | PHOTO: Daily Mail/Zillow American-Canadian actor and former professional wrestler Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has bought a new house and it costs $9 million! The “Fast and the Furious” star splashed the fortune on a 46-acre estate in Powder Springs, Georgia. The main house is 14,791 square feet. It has 8 bedrooms, a 12-stall barn, a riding arena with a viewing deck, a pool with a pool house, and a farmhouse built in 1867 that was built for the caretakers. Back in March following a visit to his aunt in the area, Dwayne said: “Funny cause it hit me yesterday as I was driving back to Atlanta, that my life is the craziest it’s ever been and I didn’t know much I TRULY NEEDED to go to a place where things can really slow down for me and I can just breathe.” The Rock tops the Forbes list of the world’s ten highest-paid actors, he earned $89.4 million between June 1, 2018, and June 1, 2019. The Rock was a professional wrestler for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) for eight years prior to pursuing an acting career. His films have grossed over $3.5 billion in North America and over $10.5 billion worldwide, making him one of the highest-grossing box-office stars of all time. Two months ago, the Rock married his longtime girlfriend singer Lauren Hashian in Hawaii. The couple has two children together: Jasmine Lia, 3, and Tiana Gia, 1. Johnson also has an 18-year-old daughter, Simone Alexandra Johnson, from his previous marriage to Dany Garcia, which ended in 2007.
