Inspector Micheal Olubode, a policeman attached to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) is facing internal disciplinary action for dressing improperly, the Nigerian police said. Olubode’s mode of dressing caught the attention of Nigeria public in recent weeks. In one of the pictures posted on Nigeria police’s twitter handle, Olubode was dressed in a black strip jeans trouser with a black cap flipped backwards accompanied with a black sunglass.  He also wore a black sleeveless jacket on top of an open black inner-wear. Olubode was also carrying a gun posing otherwise as a police officer. Nigerians for weeks circulated his pictures on social media platforms, expressing displeasure at the security officer’s mode of dressing. Most reactors criticised the Nigeria police for not enforcing its code of dressing to security personnel, particularly SARS officials. Some alleged that Olubode and his team harass and intimidate passers-by between Iyana-Ipaja and Egbeda to Ikotun axis of Lagos State where they operate. The police, however, did not disclose what measure of disciplinary action it is taking on Olubode. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
