The iconic TV series, Game of Thrones ended earlier this year after eight years run but there are still scenes from the show that fans would not be forgetting anytime soon. One of such scenes is the blunder we witnessed in the final season when a scene from the hit HBO series had a Starbucks coffee cup was left on a table in plain sight. Now, Game of Thrones star, Emilia Clarke who starred as Daenerys Targaryen is finally setting the record straight about the now-iconic flub. She made the explanations in a new clip of ‘The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,’ In the clip from the upcoming episode of The Tonight Show, Fallon plays a short clip for Clarke in which fellow Game of Thrones star, Sophie Turner who played Sansa Stark blames Clarke for the blunder.  Explaining to Fallon what really happened, Clarke said: “Okay, so here’s the truth. We had like, a party before the Emmys recently. And Conleth (Hill), who plays (Lord) Varys, who is sitting next to me in that scene, he pulls me aside and he’s like, ‘Emilia, I’ve got to tell you something, I’ve got to tell you something, love.’” An audible gasp could be heard from the crowd after Clarke tells them Conleth then said, “The coffee cup was mine!” To his disbelief, Jimmy Fallon asks, “He admitted it?!” Emilia then responds with, “It was his! It was Conleth’s coffee cup! He said so! He’s like, ‘I think it was, I’m sorry darling, I didn’t want to say anything because it seemed, you know, the heat was very much on you.’ And I was like, ‘WHAT! What?!’”
