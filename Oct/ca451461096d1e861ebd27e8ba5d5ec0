 Lagos State Commissioner for Housing, Moruf Akinderu Fatai  The state’s Commissioner for Housing, Moruf Akinderu-Fatai, who stated this at the State Secretariat, lamented the breach of contract schedule by private partners, described the time breach as unfortunate to government’s efforts in addressing housing deficit, which according to him, is a challenge requiring urgent attention. He urged them to ensure completion of all contracted housing schemes within the scheduled time-frame, threatening to revoke their contracts if they fail to expedite the completion of the projects. The commissioner said all housing schemes contracted out to private sector partners and joint investors should be completed within the time-frame indicated in the contractual agreements or have them cancelled. Re-affirming the commitment of the state government to make more Lagosians become home owners within the next two years, the commissioner said: “We are committed to delivering our mandate in ensuring that more Lagosians gain access to home ownership irrespective of their ethnicity or political dispensation within the next 24 months.” In another development, the Executive Chairman of the Lagos State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Wahab Alawiye-King, has said that the state will soon employ a technological-driven template to drive its educational system. This, according to him, will allow the State Education Board to achieve its vision of providing quality education. The SUBEB Chairman, who spoke at an interactive session while addressing head teachers of Lagos public primary schools, said the state  would be technically-compliant to address some pertinent issues around education sector and improve on its dwindling status. He, however, urged the head teachers to continually co-operate and support the new board and assured them of more trainings to get them going professionally.
