  Award-winning rapper, Oludemilade Martin Alejo, popularly known as Ycee has released a brand new song, ‘Dakun’. The new single is a part of his highly anticipated debut album set to be released in November titled “YCeevsZAHEER”. ‘Dakun’, which is a Yoruba word for ‘please’ is a pulsating easy-to-learn single which embodies a message to a beautiful lady, who is presumed to possess a charming personality laced with high moral standards and values. The enchanted male character in this story pleads that she allows him a place in her heart and the chance to prove that he is nothing like the other men she has met. Dakun is accompanied by amped-up afrobeat resonances and hip-hop beat structures and was produced by Krizbeatz. Press play!  YCee announced the release of his highly-anticipated album “YCeeVsZAHEER” via his social media handles on Twitter and Instagram on Wednesday 16th October 2019, putting out the album art and song listing for the 15-track body of work.
