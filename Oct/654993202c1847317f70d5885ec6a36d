South African police have shut down some churches in Hillbrow and Yeoville found to be involved with drug peddling and human trafficking. Over 20 churches in Johannesburg were raided by Johannesburg Metro Police while ten of them have been shut down. The police authorities said the shut churches were found to be in violation of the city’s by-laws. The police in partnership with church leaders are engaging churches to raise more awareness about the city laws. The department says no one is above the law, even faith-based organisations. “The Johannesburg metro police will never allow such churches to operate in the city, I think you said rogue churches, they will never be allowed,” said JMPD head David Tembe. Church leaders say they were troubled by initial reports of the raids but after engaging with police, they concede compliance is important. “We must emphasize that no one is above the law and that no church is above the law,” said Bishop Mosa Sono from Grace Bible Church. “Says some churches may not know about the laws and that it’s important that they teach the churches first before raiding them,” Sono added. The newly formed alliance will reach out to all church leaders in the city to educate about compliance.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
