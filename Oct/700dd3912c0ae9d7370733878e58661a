The operatives of the Ogun State Command of the Nigeria Immigration Service have arrested six illegal migrants at Idiroko borders in the state. “When you aid unknown people into your country, without even knowing their aim, it is a big risk,” the comptroller of immigration, Doris Braimah said on Tuesday while parading the suspects. “It is actually called security threat.” The illegal immigrants were being smuggled in by two Nigerians through one of the country’s major borders in the state when the officers intercepted them. The two suspects who smuggled the migrants are reported to have been on the watch list of security agencies for trafficking of migrants into the country. Braimah said the illegal migrants are from two West African countries, Mali and Guinea. She, however, noted that the two suspects would be arraigned, while the six migrants would be repatriated to their countries.
