This is the first time since 2014 that Nigeria will not be taking part in the competition. It is also the third time in the competition’s history that the Eagles will not be part of the competition, which was created for Africa-based players. A brace by Lobi Stars of Makurdi’s striker, Sikiru Alimi in each half of the match (ninth and 62nd minutes) did little to repair the damage inflicted by their Togolese counterparts’ 4-1 defeat, in the first leg of the qualifier, in Lome. After Alimi’s 19th minute goal, he again went close to scoring his second goal to double the lead, but the Togolese goalkeeper, Abdoul-Moubarak Aigba was equal to the task. The Nigerian danger man, who was a torn in the flesh of the Togolese defenders had another goal attempt, which was again contained by the Hawks’ goalkeeper. A free-kick attempt in the 39th minute by Ndifreke Effiong, outside the 18th yard box was wasted by the Eagles, while a header by Mohammed Sunusi via a throw-in by Daniel James, in the 45th minute was also wasted before the end of the first half. However, in the 62nd Alimi struck again for the Eagles, but the tally was not enough to see the country through.
