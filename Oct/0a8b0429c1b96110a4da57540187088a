• ‘Fight of Decade’ shifted to December
 • Mini Boxing Night debuts November 16
The African Boxing Union (ABU) has warned that light-weight champion, Oto ‘Joe Boy’ Joseph may lose his title if he failed to show up for the contest against West African Boxing Union (WABU) light-weight champion, Rilwan ‘Real One’ Oladosu in December. The fight, which was originally scheduled for October 12 at the National Stadium, Lagos, suffered a hitch after Joe Boy sustained a shoulder injury during training. Before then, organisers of the fight had already put everything in place for the bout. The bout tagged ‘Fight of The Decade’ has been re-scheduled for December, but the African boxing body is said to have issued a warning to Joe Boy to honour the new date or risk losing his title. It is the headline bout for the GOtv Boxing Night 20. Meanwhile, a mini version of the GOtv Boxing Night, tagged GOtv Boxing Night Mini, is set to start. The inaugural edition will hold on November 16 at the Rowe Park, Yaba, Lagos, according to the organisers, Flykite Productions. Jenkins Alumona, CEO Flykite, explained that GOtv Boxing Night Mini was conceived to provide more frequent opportunities for boxers as a means of ensuring that they got requisite number of fights to make them eligible for sub-regional, continental and international title bouts. “Our boxers have, despite the best efforts of GOtv Boxing Night, inadequate opportunities to fight and build their fight records, which they need to become eligible for international titles. GOtv Boxing Night Mini, which will be staged with more frequency than the main event, will address this challenge,” he said.
