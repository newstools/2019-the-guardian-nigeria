Mental health experts have said that dearth of research and experts are the leading causes of mental health disorders in the country.They opined that like other any other specialty, Nigeria remains under researched adding that a lot of mental health conditions are not recognised, inadequately researched and obviously not regarded as a priority, hence they are poorly funded. Speaking at Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospital Yaba, Research Conference, titled, ‘Emerging Trends and Innovations In The Management of Psychiatric Disorders: Challenges and Prospect In a Developing Country,’ Dr. Gbenga Okulate lamented on the shortage of psychiatrists and mental health workers in Nigeria especially when you see the number relative to the population of the country. “A lot of people are suffering from mental health issues.  We have challenges of poor identification, late recognition and therefore, limited funding. The result of it is that a lot of people who have mental issues suffer on their own, people don’t understand they are not feeling well,” the expert said. The psychiatrist said the aim of this conference was to train people on conducting basic research and reporting products of there research so that the results can influence clinical practices and policies at local, national and international levels. Okulate continued: “We can train people to do research. The doctors alone cannot do it.  The psychiatrist nurses, social workers all of them could be trained as long as they can work in teams then it will be a lot easier to do more with limited resources.”He said, despite the poor recognition of mental disorder the hospital has recorded an increase in presentation of mental health cases.
