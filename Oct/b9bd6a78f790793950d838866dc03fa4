The Nigerian National Association for the Deaf has urged all tiers of government to implement policies that would aid the plight of special persons across the country. The plea was made during a press briefing of the group yesterday in Lagos. According to Alhaji Lukman, chairman of the group in Lagos, being deaf is not a disability but only loss of hearing, which could happen to anyone. “We are appealing to government to implement their various policy to carry every segment of the society along. Deaf people have the right to movement and to work just as a normal person. Mr. Usman Ahmed, member of the board of trustees and president of the body in Zamfara State, urged television stations to engage the use of sign instructors for broadcast of their news bulletin and also endeavour to subtitle their programmes for the benefit of the deaf community. Meanwhile, also worried by the neglect of people with special needs in the society, Nigerians have been enjoined to bestow special attention on persons with disabilities. Making the call at the Beady’s Word Production business summit and fair, chairman, Lagos State chapter of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Tunde Balogun, stressed the need for society to appreciate the disabled. He said the APC-led government in Lagos has evolved an adaptable policy to accommodate persons with disabilities because of their special roles in the society. Also, Lagos State coordinator of Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN), Mr. Yinka Fisher, called for a synergy between government and the private sector to ensure proper integration of people with special needs. The CEO of Beadys Word Productions, Beady Nnanna, said the summit was organized to impact on the lives of the disabled who are often abandoned in the society.
