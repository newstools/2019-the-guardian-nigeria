SOURCE: Google  The Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Olamilekan Adegbite, accused some mining companies operating in the country of under-remitting taxes to the Federal Government.“There would be no room for royalty payment evasion. All mineral exports shall be inspected by government-appointed independent pre-shipment inspection agents, who are empowered by law to render quantity and quality control services and monitor pricing. This control mechanism is in accordance with the Pre-shipment Inspection of Exports Act,” he said.  Mohammed said the Federal Government initiated a funding scheme for artisanal miners through the Bank of Industry (BoI), but only one miner has been able to access the fund, hence the need to simplify the process to enable others to benefit.Stating that insecurity, regulatory issues, infrastructure and multiple taxes continue to affect the sector; Mohammed said inadequate geological data post critical challenge to mining investment decisions.
 
From his perspective, Jayeola, said sustaining current efforts will go a long way to make the country achieve desired results in the sector, and urged government to speed up efforts in the formalisation of artisanal miners. He said: “Artisanal miners are 80 per cent of the mining population therefore formalising them will be value to them and the government.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
