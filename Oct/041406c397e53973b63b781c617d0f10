Mbappe has tried out his thigh three times in his bid for fitness with cameo appearances at Bordeaux and Galatasaray. “They have been out for a long time and while others have seized their chance we are stronger now they are back,” said Tuchel. PSG sit top of their Champions League group with six points while Club Brugge are second on two, with Galatasaray and Real Madrid both on one.
