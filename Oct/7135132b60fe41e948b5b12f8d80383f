Government has been urged to provide support, free healthcare and monthly stipends for elderly members of the society. This advice was given at an event to mark the International Day of Older Persons by Community of Sant’ egidio, a group committed to the uplifting of the downtrodden in the society. This was also the position of some aging persons at the programme. They said it has become important that government across different levels pay attention to the plight of elderly people, as many are left to suffer because of lack of care from family members and the government.
   
One of the elderly women at the programme, Mrs. Teniola Adeyemi said that government should support them with monthly stipends for daily upkeeps.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
