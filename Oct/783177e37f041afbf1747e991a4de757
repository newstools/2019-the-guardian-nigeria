The Super Eagles will meet Brazil in an international friendly in Singapore… on Sunday. Photo/Twitter/NGSuperEagles Super Eagles’ new boy, Joe Aribo is fit to play for Nigeria against Brazil in Singapore on Sunday, Glasgow Rangers Manager, Stephen Gerrard has disclosed. There were doubts over the fitness of the midfielder, who opened the scoring in his first outing for Nigeria in a friendly against Ukraine last month. The match ended in a 2-2 draw. The Rangers’ star copped an injury during a Scottish League Cup clash with Livingston on September 25, but he was fit enough to make Gerard’s squad for the Premier League game against Hamilton Academy at the weekend. Gerrard said Aribo would join his mates in Singapore today ahead of Sunday’s game with Brazil. Speaking to Glasgow Evening Times, Gerrard said: “Joe (Aribo) was very close to being 100 per cent so that is a positive for us. “I would have Joe if needed but I wanted to give his scar as much time as possible to heal, he will go away on international duty and probably be involved with Nigeria.” Super Eagles players and their officials will arrive in Singapore today to start preparations for the game against the five-time world champions. The team will be lodged at the Fairmont Hotel, Singapore. The game will kick off at the Singapore National Stadium, Kallang by 1.00 p.m. Nigerian time. On arrival in Singapore today, the team will hold their first training session this evening. They will have the opportunity of watching the Brazilians in action against the Teranga Lions of Senegal tomorrow.
