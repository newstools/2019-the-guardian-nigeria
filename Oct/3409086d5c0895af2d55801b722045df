The suspects The environmental task force of Amuwo Odofin Local Government Area, Lagos, has arrested two persons suspected of stealing manhole covers in the area. The suspects were apprehended while attempting to cart away about three manhole covers from 401 and 512 roads, FESTAC Town. Theft of manhole covers cause severe damages such as exposed underground services, which can be tampered with, damage to property, cars and could cause personal injuries to commuters as well as possible terrorist attacks that could access cities through sewers. Based on current commodity price of iron, a stolen manhole cover might fetch more than $30. Besides the cost and hassle of replacing the missing covers, officials in the state are concerned about the hazards that gaping holes in the city could pose to pedestrians and drivers. Chairman of the task force, Marcus Adetifa, who disclosed the arrest, said the purchasers of the manhole have also been identified.
