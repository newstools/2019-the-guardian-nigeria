A win for Lille would have moved them above surprise package Angers following their 4-0 hammering at the hands of league leaders Paris Saint-Germain on Saturday. Instead, Christophe Galtier’s side stays in fifth on 15 points from nine matches but could have easily lost against a spirited Nimes side that belied their pre-match league position of 17th. The lively Romain Philippoteaux, who won the spot-kick that Ripart calmly slotted home, came close to scoring a wonderful individual strike when his finish clipped the outside of the post following an exciting dribble. Later Rennes host Reims before Lyon looks to put a dreadful recent run behind them when they travel to fierce local rivals Saint Etienne in Clade Puel’s first game in charge of Les Verts on Sunday’s late match.
