First Bank, on the back of their unbeaten run, which dates back to 2016, will hope to take a step towards winning their 10th national title against new entrants, BlackGold. Team of the moment and one of the early title favourites, Air Warriors, who finished top of Group B, will tackle Plateau Rocks, who have failed to win a game at the National Final Eight phase. The newly formed Air Warriors, bankrolled by the Nigerian AirForce, will again depend on the trio of double-double Queen, Murjanatu Musa, veteran player, Blessing Kasham and Chinwe Okah in their quest to qualify for their first-ever semifinal. The third game of the day will be between Dolphins and Delta Force. Having last won the title in 2015 and losing to First Bank in the 2018 finals, all eyes will be on the Coach Peter Ahmedu tutored side when they file out against Delta Force. The last quarterfinals promises to be explosive as it features two evenly matched sides, Customs, and MFM Queens. It will be a grudge match for MFM, who was denied a podium finish in 2018 when they lost to Customs in the third-place game. The semi-finals of the competition will hold tomorrow at the same venue.
