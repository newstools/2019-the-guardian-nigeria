Balarabe, who made the disclosure, yesterday, while inaugurating the Grievance Redress Committee (GRC) under the APPEALS project in the state, said that each of the value chains has high potentials for market driven sustainable development.
She explained that the partnership with the World Bank was to transit agriculture from subsistence to a commercially viable and market-oriented business, and attract investments into the sector in order to create jobs and improve standard of living. “The project is a needed impetus to improve agricultural production, ensure food security, job creation and economic development in beneficiary states and the country,” she said.On the inauguration of the GRC, the deputy governor said it is an important element needed for the successful implementation of the project in the state. State Project Coordinator, Dr. Yahaya Abdulhadi Aminu said the GRC is a key strategy for addressing issues, concerns, or problems, perceived or actual that an individual or a community may raise. Aminu, while commending the state government for being the first to pay its counterpart funds amongst other participating states, said the committee will facilitate the resolution of grievances raised by people directly affected by environmental and social impacts of the APPEALS project.
