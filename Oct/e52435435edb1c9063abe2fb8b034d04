If you love your coffee in the morning, you’ll definitely loooove these coffee flavoured muffins. And if you are like my husband who cannot go a day without coffee, I’d advise you use instant espresso granules for a more intense coffee flavour. You can use melted butter instead of the oil, this is usually what I prefer to use anyway. Feel free to tweak and make your muffins more enjoyable by adding nuts, chocolate chips, raisins especially if you have a sweet tooth. This recipe makes 12 muffins. Ingredients Method
