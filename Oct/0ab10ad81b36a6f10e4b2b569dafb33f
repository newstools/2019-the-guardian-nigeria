 Jeff Bezos is back as the richest man in the world after Bill Gates briefly earned the title as reported by TMZ.  Briefly, before his Amazon stock increased, he was at number 2, looking up to Bill Gates. His drop in rank previously could be as a result of this year’s costly divorce with ex-wife MacKenzie, who took a huge chunk of his fortune. MacKenzie’s net worth now stands at $32.7 billion, placing her among the top 20 in the world.
