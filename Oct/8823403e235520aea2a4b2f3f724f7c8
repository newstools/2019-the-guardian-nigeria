We know when Skepta and Wizkid team up on a song, ‘bad energy’ has no choice but to stay away. It is also a given that the British rapper does not fail to represent his fatherland, Nigeria; at the same time, he has been able to keep a very close relationship with Wizkid. Their relationship first came to light when both he and Drake hopped on the remix of Wizkid’s “Ojuelegba”, and we have since had the mind-blowing “Energy” collaboration. In a recent radio interview with CapitalXtra, Wizkid revealed that there is another collaboration in the works with Skepta which he describes as a “serious” one.

Expected to be on his fourth studio album titled Made In Lagos, ‘Ghetto Love’ is a dancehall-infused song crafted in the mould of a lot of Wizkid’s songs. He sings about unrequited love from ‘Adanma’. Still, Wizkid wants to ‘die there,’ as we say in Nigeria. Joro is also similar to Ghetto Love as it is a love song as well. As usual, Starboy sticks to his winning formula on the song – relatively short length, infectious beat that can appeal to the street, club and office groove, and it sounds like a few other ones he has jumped on in the past.
