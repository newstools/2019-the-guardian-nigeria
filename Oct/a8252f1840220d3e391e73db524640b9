Ujoatuonu condemned the initiators of the scheme and distanced his company from such a partnership. He further disclosed that steps have been taken to involve anti-fraud and law enforcement agencies in a bid to nip the fraudulent activity of the group in the bud and to prevent them from further dragging the reputation of Universal Insurance Plc in the mud.
