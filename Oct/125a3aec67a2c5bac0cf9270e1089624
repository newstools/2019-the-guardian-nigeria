The Independent National Electoral Commissin (INEC) has fixed November 30 for the Katsina State House of Assembly by-election for Sabuwa constituency seat. INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in the state Jibrin Ibrahim Zarewa said this on Wednesday while briefing newsmen on activities slated for the period before the poll. The seat became vacant following the death of the then lawmaker, Hon Mustafa Abdullahi. Abdullahi, 60, lost his life in a ghastly accident along Funtua-Zaria road on July 5. Before his death, the lawmaker was elected in 2015 and was re-elected in 2019. Although the election was supposed to have taken place three months after the seat was declared vacant, the exercise was however shifted to the new date due to the security situation in the council area. Zarewa said notice of election has been made public, while conduct of primaries by political parties including resolution of disputes arising from the primaries, is expected to take place from the 24th to 6th November. He said the deadline for submission of forms CF 001, CF 002 and nomination forms at INEC headquarters, Abuja,is scheduled between 6th to 8th  of November, while publication form CF 001 and list of nominated candidates is for 15th November. He said campaigns are to end 28th  November but that the commission would allow for collection of Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) before the poll. He revealed that the constituency  has 74 polling units, 63,435 registered voters, and 61,991 PVCs collected adding that 1,442 PVCs were yet to be collected. Zarewa said that despite the area having security challenges, efforts would be made to secure lives of those to conduct the poll, including adhoc staff and corps members.
