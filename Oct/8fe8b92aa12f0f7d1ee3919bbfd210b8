Although we expect pockets of gains over the final months of the year, as fund and portfolio managers realign portfolios prior to the start of 2020. “Nonetheless, we note that valuations remain attractive driven by price deterioration throughout the year. Hence, we advise that long-term investors consider appropriately timed investments.” However, market breadth closed positive, with 11 gainers against eight losers.
