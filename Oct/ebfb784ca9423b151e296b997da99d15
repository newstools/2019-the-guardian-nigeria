 [FILES] Alhaji Mohammed Sabo Nanono, Honourable Minister, Federal Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Development  Nanono, who was having Town Hall meeting with farmers and stakeholders in Kano, insisted he would not comment on the controversial issue. The minister had contended with tons of criticism following a statement credited to him where he claimed Nigerian can feed on a good meal with N30 particularly in Kano after boosted that the country is food secured. Earlier at the town hall meeting, the minister had hinted the Federal Government plans to revamp the moribund textile industry in Kano. The minister, who underscored the high usage of textile, regretted that Nigeria still remains among top importers of textile materials in the world, an attitude he argued capable of killing the country’s economy. Nanonon pledged that Buhari’s administration is committed to revolutionise agricultural system with a deliberate plan to attract investors to set up assembly plants in Nigeria. “Already, we are planning to establish service centers across the local government areas in Nigeria where farmers can access mechanised and other farm inputs. ” With this establishment, the machines and other facilities will be sourced and assembled in Nigeria. Federal Government is attracting these companies to set up their factories in Nigeria and when they do that, it will generate not less than 3.8 million jobs. We would continue to support our farmers especially the Rice millers to produce more to meet the nation’s demand.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
