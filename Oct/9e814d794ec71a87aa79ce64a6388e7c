Gunmen suspected to be kidnappers have reportedly killed an Islamic cleric, identified as Mallam Gambo, in Jalingo, Taraba State. The killers were said to have also abducted several persons whose whereabouts were unknown at the time of going to press. The incident, which occurred about 6pm on Monday in Sibire village along Jalingo/Mutumbiyu road, has continued to cause panic amid the heavy presence of security operatives in the state. The Guardian gathered that the deceased were on their way from their farms when they ran into the heavily armed bandits. A witness, who reportedly escaped, said the gunmen blocked the road for several hours firing sporadically at vehicles coming from Jalingo and Wukari axes, unchallenged by security operatives. Confirming the report, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), David Misal, said that two persons were killed and about seven persons rescued by the police. The command could not confirm the number of persons abducted, but added that operatives were on the trail of the bandits. Meanwhile, troops from the Nigerian Navy School of Armament Technology, Kachia, Kaduna State, yesterday paraded five suspected cattle rustlers. The command also displayed 267 cows and 51 sheep recovered from the suspects last Saturday. Handing over the animals to Kaduna State government in line with the mandate of the Operation Yaki at the school, the Commandant, Cdre. Tanko Pani, noted that rustling and other criminal activities were not new in the area, but that his command would intensify efforts to make the place safer. “We have been able to restore sanity in a few months since my resumption at the command as attested to by the communities and motorists plying the Kachia/Kaduna and Kachia/Jere roads. This is an isolated case and we will be doing our best to consolidate on current successes without compromise.” However, the Secretary of the Anglican Communion (Worldwide) and Chairman of Kaduna State Peace Commission, Archbishop Josiah Idowu-Fearon, has tasked security operatives to end insecurity in the state. He pointed out that though it was not yet uhuru in Kaduna, the citizens had every reason to roll out the drums for celebration considering the relative peace in the state. Appraising the activities of the Kaduna Peace Commission at a press conference, Idowu-Fearon stated, “As I mentioned in April 2019, it is gratifying that relative calm and social order prevail in most parts of the state, including those councils where violent conflicts were recurring such as parts of Kaura, Zangon Kataf and Sanga councils. “Similarly, the confrontations in Kajuru and parts of Igabi councils have substantially reduced.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
