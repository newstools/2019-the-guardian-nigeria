 Scale of Justice  Executive Director of the Institute, Prof. Obiajulu Emejulu told The Guardian that award of degrees “was a function clearly set out for NINLAN by the enabling Act” which he cited as Act 112 of 1992. He said that amending the enabling Act would require replacing the clause “Academic Board” with  “Senate”. According to him, it is the Senate of tertiary institutions that award degrees and not the Academic Board as erroneously inserted into the enabling law at the point of enactment. He pointed out that NINLAN, which is a federal government-owned degree-awarding institution, among others, was mandated to provide courses of instruction and other facilities for the pursuit of learning Nigerian Languages, which includes “award of testimonials, certificates, and degrees to persons who complete courses of study in the Institute”. Prof. Emejulu, who explained that the award of degrees must have the approval of the National Universities Commission (NUC), pointed out that NUC has not permitted NINLAN to commence its degree programme because of the wrong clause “Academic Board “ instead of “Senate” stated in the NINLAN Act. “The delay in commencement of the Institute’s degree programme is a huge set back for the Institute because it is the degree programme that will boost the Institute’s students’ population. NINLAN has all it takes to award degrees in the relevant subject areas enjoined by its law, including qualified academics in the subject areas”, he said. The NINLAN Chief Executive Officer, however, disclosed that on May 9, 2019,  the Federal Ministry of Education (FME) hosted a round table to discuss the amendment of the NINLAN Act to replace “Academic Board “ with “Senate”.
