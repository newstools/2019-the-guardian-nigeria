The bridge was made neutral territory for four hours during the event, held for the seventh time, to allow undocumented migrants to the US to see their Mexican families. “I have no words to describe this, it’s something very beautiful, something that was needed,” 20-year-old Brandon told AFP as he wiped tears from his face. He said he was meeting his parents and 5 sisters who live in Mexico and who he hadn’t seen for 5 years. Organized by the Border Network for Human Rights, the event saw 260 families reunite with their loved ones.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
