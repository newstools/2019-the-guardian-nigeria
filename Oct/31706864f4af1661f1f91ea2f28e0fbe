This is coming a few weeks after the rapper won “Best International Flow” at the 2019 BET Hip Hop Awards, thereby becoming the first-ever winner of the newly created category. In his BET acceptance speech, Sarkodie urged everyone to take a trip to Ghana during the year of return. “I think Africa has always had it and it is about that time. This year is the Year of Return and I would urge each and every one of you here to take a trip back home”. The “Year of Return” is a initiative of the Ghanaian government to commemorate 400 years since the first enslaved Africans arrived in Jamestown, Virginia in the United States. The campaign encourages African diasporans to come to Africa to settle and invest in the continent.
