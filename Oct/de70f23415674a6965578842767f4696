She now plays title-holder Caroline Wozniacki on Saturday in the last four. The first installment in what should be the start of a long rivalry did not disappoint as Osaka brought the young Canadian’s run of 17 wins in a row to an end. Fresh from stunning Serena Williams in the final of the US Open, the 19-year-old Andreescu surged into a 5-1 lead in the first set. But Osaka, the Australian Open champion and a former number one, powered back to make it 5-5. Only for Andreescu to break once more, before ramming home her advantage in a riveting first set. Fourth-ranked Osaka, the Japanese who beat Williams to become the 2018 US Open champion, was soon under pressure in the second set. Sixth-ranked Andreescu went up 3-1, but Osaka then reeled off five games straight to level at one set each and go to a decider. Osaka nailed the third match point with an ace, her 11th of the match.
