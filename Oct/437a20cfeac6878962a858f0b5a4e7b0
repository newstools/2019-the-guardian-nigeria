Learning is a continuous process that helps us grow, especially intellectually. It just never stops, says Oluwabusayo Adebowale, founder of Inspired Kids Network. While most kids are not born good learners, it is a habit that can be harnessed and groomed. Hence, the need to device ways to help kids appreciate learning. While individual personality plays a big part in a child’s willingness to learn and their overall disposition when it comes to schooling and education, most children who are good learners at some point groomed the habit. With basic aptitude and the right motivation, every child can become a good learner. For Mrs. Adebowale who runs an online book- store for kids, limiting learning ability of kids to the classroom is a big mistake anyone would make, as the overall wellness and growth is also a combination of activities outside the four walls of a classroom. Here are ways to help your child uncover the joy of learning:
Develop an atmosphere of reading: Reading not only helps children develop a much richer vocabulary, it helps their brain learn how to process concepts and formal communication. Help your child develop reading skills and a love for reading by filling his world with reading. Read to your child frequently. Have your child real aloud. Create a family reading time where everyone focuses on reading for 20 minutes a day. Through your own example of reading and by filling your classroom and/or home with reading materials (novels, posters, newspapers, magazines, etc.) you’ll create an atmosphere of reading that will demonstrate to your child just how important reading is. Focus on what your child is learning, not his performance: Instead of asking your child how he did in his math test as soon as he gets home from school, have him teach you what he learned in mathematics today. Focus on what your child is learning, as opposed to how he is performing. While performance is important, focusing on his learning experience will communicate to your child that actual learning is more important than test grades and results are not the most important thing. Encourage game-based learning: Using games as an education tool not only provides opportunities for deeper learning and development of non-cognitive skills, it helps motivate children to want to learn. When a child is actively engaged with a game, their mind experiences the pleasure of learning a new system. Games that are entertaining provide the added benefit of motivating children to want to engage in the learning process and want to learn more. Put your child in the driver’s seat as much as possible: Suffice to say, let your kids feel like they are in control. When it comes to their education, they often withdraw from learning, so it’s important to guide them through the learning process. But it’s just as important to allow children to have control of their own learning experience. Whether at home, or in the classroom, provide children the ability to have direct input into their learning choices. Recognise and celebrate achievements: No matter how small they may be, it’s important to recognise and celebrate your child’s achievements. This is especially important for elementary age school children, who require constant positive reinforcement to keep them motivated to learn and challenge themselves to do better. Focus on strength: Focusing on strengths can be difficult when there is so much your child struggles with academically. Notwithstanding, focusing on your child’s strengths is vital to healthy emotional and academic development and progress. It is another form of positive reinforcement that will motivate him to keep learning. Share your enthusiasm for learning: Enthusiasm rubs off, especially when it comes to learning new things. If your child sees that you’re sincerely enthusiastic about learning, they’re likely to become enthusiastic about learning. Whether it’s history, science, reading, writing or even math, help him see that learning is a journey of exciting new discoveries. Take every opportunity to discover new information with them. As your child sees the joy and excitement learning brings to your life, they will begin to share your enthusiasm for learning new things as it comes.
