The final phase of the NBBF President’s Cup and venue will be communicated to all teams after teams in due time, the NBBF disclosed yesterday. Rivers’ Hoopers Coach, Ogoh Odaudu said he was not happy with his team’s performance despite finishing tops in their group. “It’s a good feeling even though I feel we should have played better than we did in our five games. So, it’s something I am worried about heading towards the final phase. We will definitely go back to work on the things we didn’t do properly,” he said. Odaudu said he saw Kwara Falcons, Civil Defenders and Lagos Islanders as threats to his team, adding, however, that they were optimistic of picking the sole ticket to the Basketball Africa League scheduled for March 2020.
