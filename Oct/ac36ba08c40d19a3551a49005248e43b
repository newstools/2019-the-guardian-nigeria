Property worth millions of naira was yesterday consumed in two fire accidents around Egbeda and Alagbado area of Lagos State. A storey building was gutted by fire yesterday afternoon at Shasha-Egbeda but was brought under control by the response team of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA). Though information gathered by the agency at the scene of the incident revealed that the fire emanated from the kitchen, the cause of the inferno could not yet be ascertained as at the time the fire was put out.
The fire at No. 8, Ogunrinde Street, off Shasha-Egbeda, ravaged the 10 rooms of the building, also affecting the kitchen and toilet. Fortunately, no casualty or mortality was recorded. In a similar development, residents of Lagos at AIT road by Coca Cola bus stop, Alagbado, were woken by the fire outbreak at a mini plastics factory.
