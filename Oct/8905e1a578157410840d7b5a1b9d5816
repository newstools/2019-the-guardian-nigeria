 Benin High Court has restrained the Edo Government and its agents from demolishing a hotel belonging to a chieftain of the APC. Photo: PIXABAY  The Ministry of Urban Planning had issued a seven-day notice for the relocation of the hospitality sited at Ugbor within the capital, saying it was built on government land. But Justice D. I. Okungbowa yesterday gave the restraining order in the suit numbered B/151/05/2019 and filed by Adun. However, the plaintiff has pleaded with the state government to temper justice with mercy. He said the property had a certificate of occupancy besides the court’s injunction. Addressing reporters in Benin City, he stated: “You see, this is my deed of transfer for the property.  This is the Oba’s approval. This is the signature of the Surveyor-General of the state. “You can see the youths from all parts of the state here in solidarity and the governor, even though I may have wronged him anyway through politics or freedom of speech, should please have mercy.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
