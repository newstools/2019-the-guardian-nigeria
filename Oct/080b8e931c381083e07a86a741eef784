He said: “Hyperrealism was a genre of painting and sculpture that bore a strong resemblance to a high-resolution photograph. It is often referred to as an advancement of photorealism (a genre of art that encompasses painting, drawing and other graphic media, in which an artist studies a photograph and then attempts to reproduce the image as realistically as possible), hyperrealism takes the conversation further.” In the Brick Lane Art Gallery where the solo exhibition took place, Nwadiogbu promoted hyperrealism movement – or Contemporealism as he calls it, which is his pioneered style that is primarily centered on Hyper-Realism and Contemporary art.
 
According to him, his hyper realistic pieces were shockingly visceral, so lifelike you feel you could touch them. He added that they were further emphasized by his incredible eye for detail and careful specificity through his use of contemporary elements like charcoal, acrylic, and collage.
