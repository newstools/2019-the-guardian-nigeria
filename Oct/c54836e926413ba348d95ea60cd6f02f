Experts in the country’s business sector have tipped family enterprises as a tool that can create multigenerational growth, saying Nigerians can emancipate more citizens from the scourge of abject poverty by setting up family businesses.
 
According to them, a recent survey conducted by PwC on family businesses showed that 53 per cent of family businesses in Nigeria witnessed growth in 2018, and 20 per cent experienced double-digit growth.
 
They said about 87 per cent of the existing family businesses in the country are expected to grow over the next two years, as 33 per cent of them have a formal mid-term strategic plan in place, while 67 per cent have a clear sense of agreed value and purpose as a company.  In her remarks, Chief Executive Officer, NAPL, Nike Anani, said one of the challenges faced by the next generation who join family businesses is building new social circles, and finding their identity in the business.
 
“A challenge we often face as the next generation in family businesses is feeling like we can’t compare with our parents knowing that they have done so well in building the businesses, but having clarity of purpose is key.
 
“Children must not take over the family business from their parents though they have a role to play in the wider structure. Their going into the business should be about them being interested in it and then being competent in it,” she said.
