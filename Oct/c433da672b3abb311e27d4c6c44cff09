Residents of Anuoluwapo Community Development Association (CDA) and its environs in Aboru, Agbado-Okeodo Local Council Development Area (LCDA) of Lagos State have pleaded with the governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu to help install bumps on their roads, as many residents’ lives are being daily endangered by over-speeding drivers.
 
The residents said the rubber speed bumps installed when the roads around their corridor were constructed by the immediate past administration had all worn out and have disappeared from the road. They said as a result, many drivers and motorcyclists speed with no caution, sometimes leading to accidents.
   
Speaking on behalf of the residents, the chairman, Anuoluwapo Community Development Association (CDA), Imam Wasiu Popoola, said there is no day the community don’t witness an accident. He disclosed that in one of the recent accidents, two lives were lost, adding that the worst hit victims are residents of Ayo Afolabi Street.
   
Pained by the incidents and wanting to remedy the situation, he said the Anuoluwapo CDA, has taken several steps, including drawing the attention of the state and local government to the development but government officials seem unperturbed by their plight.
   
Popoola said when the CDA wrote the Agbado-Okeodo LCDA, the chairman instructed them to go to their councillor, who in turn asked them to go back to the LCDA chairman, who then directed them to write to the state government. The CDA complied by writing a letter to the state, but no action has yet been taken a year after.
   
Corroborating the residents’ statement, Dr. Oluwafemi Adediran of Peak Health Hospital, who said he could not provide the statistics of accidents within the area because his hospital is not the only one, disclosed that some accident victims had been brought to his facility for attention.
