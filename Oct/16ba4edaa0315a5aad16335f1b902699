Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, has distanced himself from insinuations that he will anoint or impose somebody to succeed him in 2023. Ortom, who debunked the claims yesterday, while addressing the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) stakeholders meeting in Makurdi, assured party members that he would rather allow the party to field a candidate of its choice during primaries. He said: “I will work with any candidate that the party may field.  Nobody should deceive you, I do not have an anointed candidate.” He advised party members to stick to zoning to produce chairmen and councillors at the November 30, 2019 council election. He said: “Zoning will give us the results we want. Zoning is very critical in politics. I advise people that intend to contest to embrace zoning.  If they are not favoured by zoning, they should not contest at all. They should not even buy form or waste their resources. We are going to be transparent. I am not going to impose any candidate on you, be it chairman or councilor…” Earlier, the PDP Chairman, Sir John Ngbede, encouraged party faithful to ensure the party wins overwhelmingly during the council polls.
