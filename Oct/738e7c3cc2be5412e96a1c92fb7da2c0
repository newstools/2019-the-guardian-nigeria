APC challenges opposition to prove allegations
The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Ekiti State has said that it will boycott the December 7, 2019 local council election in the state over alleged plot by the ruling party to rig. In a statement signed and made available to newsmen in Ado-Ekiti yesterday by Yinka Olomofe on behalf of Ado-Ekiti Council Stakeholders, the party directed its members to distance themselves from the election. The PDP described the election as a shambolic exercise, alleging that information available revealed that Governor Kayode Fayemi had allegedly perfected plans to rig the exercise through political thugs. Besides, the opposition party also alleged that the Chairman of the State Independent Electoral Commission (SIEC), Justice Jide Aladejana, lacked the moral impetus to superintend over the electoral body. It said that SIEC was not capable of conducting free, fair and credible election since the electoral body was allegedly under the whims and caprices of the governor.The party said the ‘purported council election’ was a plan to use EKSIEC as a conduit pipe to allegedly loot the state treasury to a tune of N5 billion. “The integrity of the chairman of State Independent Electoral Commission is in doubt,” the statement read in part.But reacting to the allegations, the All Progressives Congress (APC) described them as mere conjectural statements lacking content of validity in all measures. The party’s state Publicity Secretary, Mr. Ade Ajayi, challenged the opposition party to come out with facts and figures to substantiate their utopian allegations. Ajayi said that the APC is readily prepared for the election, saying the party will soon set out its machineries on motion to embark on house-to-house campaign to garner votes for the party.
