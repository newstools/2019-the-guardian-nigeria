The BEDC Electricity Plc. has flagged off the Meter Asset Provider (MAP) by rolling out prepaid meters to its customers in Delta State, with Asaba as its takeoff point, and a promise to provide 200, 000 units in two years. With the commencement of the exercise, which took off through Inlaks Solution Limited, G-Unit Engineering Ltd and Turbo Energy Ltd, MAP is expected to carry out roll out at locations, routes, and streets with enumerators, as enumeration is a prerequisite for meters to be provided. Speaking, BEDC Executive Director, Commercial, Abu Ejoor, said the main objectives of this scheme is to encourage the development of independent and competitive meter services in Nigeria Electricity Supply Industry, NESI and eliminate billing practices that are not in tune with best practices. “Most importantly, this scheme will help to attract private sector investment for the provisions of metering services in NESI; it also closes the metering gap through accelerated roll-out also in NESI, and lastly, it enhances revenue assurances as well.” Ejoor, who expressed concern on the power outage that has dipped since September 3 due to a failed transformer that dropped electricity supply from 90 megawatts to 30 megawatts, said that out of the nine percent, which comes to BEDC from the national grid, Delta State consumes 37 percent. “Our major challenges remain transmission which has hampered our ability to receive power for onward sales to our customers across Delta North and Warri, as recorded 126 outages in the state in September alone. The limitations of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) and bottlenecks have been of a major worry for, especially in Asaba, Efurun, Afesere, and Oghara.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
