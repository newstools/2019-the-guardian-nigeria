To those who have been following the “Star Wars” trilogy since inception, this will definitely interest you. Its creators have released the final trailer for the upcoming film “Star Wars: Rise of the Skywalker” and it appears Luke Skywalker’s epic legacy in a galaxy far, far away may be coming to an end. But it also marks the return of some of the series greatest characters. Both Luke and Leia return in the trailer, alongside the long-awaited Emperor Palpatine, who shares a brief threatening message. “Long have I waited, and now your coming together is your undoing,” Palpatine says. The final film in the Skywalker saga, “The Rise of Skywalker” is about a “new generation, what they’ve inherited, the light and the dark,” said director J.J. Abrams at a Star Wars Celebration in April, before teasing that characters will face off against “the greatest evil.” Daisy Ridley also hinted at her character Rey’s turn to the dark side at Disney’s D23 conference in August, saying, “It’s weirdly the most human thing because you’re like everybody struggles; everybody has the things where like one thing is pulling me this way, on thing is pulling me this way.” Watch the trailer below:
