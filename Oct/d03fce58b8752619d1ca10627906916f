 [FILES] Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo.<br />Photo/Twitter/SeyiAMakinde  The request was contained in a letter forwarded to the Assembly by the governor and read at the plenary by the Speaker, Adebo Ogundoyin, yesterday. The Oyo State government is seeking to access the loan to develop Akufo and Eruwa farm settlements into farm estates in the state. The two farm settlements are to serve as pilot projects, which will be used to develop other farm settlements across the state. While reacting to the request, Isiaka Tunde (Oyo East/West) and Dele Adeola (Iseyin/Itesiwaju) stressed the need for Governor Makinde to spread the scope and usage of the agricultural loan to other zones in the state and not limit it to Akufo and Eruwa farm settlements alone. Also, the Deputy Speaker, Abiodun Fadeyi and Minority Leader, Asimiyu Alarape, urged the extension of the project to other areas across the state and also implored the government to ensure judicious use of the loan to achieve the purpose for which it is sought. In another development, the state Commissioner for Information, Culture, and Tourism, Dr. Wasiu Olatunbosun, has tasked parents to inculcate the culture of speaking Yoruba language in their children so that the language would not go into extinction. Olatunbosun gave the charge while hosting Egbe Akomolede ati Asa Ile Yoruba, a Yoruba socio-cultural group, led by the leader, Alagba Olanrewaju Akano, in his office. The commissioner, who lamented the gradual extinction of Yoruba language, said that the new generation could no longer communicate in Yoruba language. He said Yoruba people were known for moral uprightness and strive to develop the society, the traits, he said, were mostly absent in the present world as such good attributes were no longer in existence due to loss of moral values and cultural integrity‚Äù To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
