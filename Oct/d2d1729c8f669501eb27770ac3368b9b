Labour leaders in Kaduna State yesterday embarked on a protest against the non-payment of Kaduna Textiles Limited (KTL) and Arewa Textiles workers, several years after the closure of the factories. They blamed governors for the collapse of the textile industry in the North. Hundreds of National Union of Textile Garment and Tailoring Workers of Nigeria (NUTGWN) members, who joined officials of the Kaduna branch of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) to mark the global mass action for Decent Work, picketed the CWAY Water factory, Federal Secretariat, Kawo and dilapidated premises of the KTL. They condemned the governors for the non-payment of textile workersâ€™ emoluments after they were laid off.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
