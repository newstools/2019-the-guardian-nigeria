Masked members of Guinea’s security forces detained the FNDC’s coordinator Abdourahamane Sanoh, and other top members of the umbrella grouping said an opposition leader Cellou Dalein Diallo. Last month Conde, 81, called on the public to prepare for a referendum and elections, stirring talk that he was planning to overcome a constitutional ban on a third term in office The FNDC has called for a general strike and protests on Monday throughout the country.
