 Cross River State Governor, Ben Ayade  Performing the ceremony yesterday in Benin City, the governor, who was represented by his deputy, Prof. Ivara Esu, charged members of the commission to be forthright in their conduct. The appointees are Justice Obojor Ogar (rtd); Ntufam Joe Ebam; Dr. Teresa Ikwen and Mr. Tasen Okune. Ayade said: “We trust that the same way you have always been forthright in your duties, some of you as retired judges of the state High Court, some of you as members of the Bar, that you will continue to serve the state especially on this particular way so that we continue to have a smooth, well-managed and well-run judicial service commission. “You have all been chosen very carefully based on your track record and your performances in the state and the nation at large.
You have just been called to continue with that service, it is a specialised service, and mainly to the judiciary of the state.” He reminded the appointees that, “statutorily, the chairman of the commission is the Chief Judge of the state as well as the Attorney General. They do not need to be formally inaugurated or sworn in because they are already members of the commission.” Responding on behalf of his colleagues, Justice Ogar thanked the governor for finding them “worthy to be appointed members of this critical commission representing the third arm of government.” Admitting that the team was aware of the enormous challenges associated with the commission, she pledged: “We are determined not to betray the confidence you have reposed in us.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
