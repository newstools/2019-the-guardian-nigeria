 WASHINGTON, DC – OCTOBER 17: Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) talks to reporters during her weekly news conference at the U.S. Capitol October 17, 2019 in Washington, DC. Pelosi spoke with admiration and respect about the late Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) who passed away earlier in the day.

The statement described the visiting American delegation as “bipartisan,” though congressman Mac Thornberry was the only Republican representative listed as being on the trip. The US visit to Jordan comes after Turkey launched an offensive against Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria on October 9, following President Trump’s withdrawal of troops from the area. Trump has defended his move as “strategically brilliant” but earlier this week 129 members of his Republican Party joined Democrats in the House of Representatives denounced the withdrawal. On Wednesday, Pelosi and Senate minority leader Charles Schumer walked out of an acrimonious White House meeting with Trump on Syria, a sign of the deteriorating relations as the House conducts an impeachment inquiry. The administration then brokered a ceasefire between Turkish and Kurdish forces Thursday, but on Saturday the sides accused each other of violating the agreement. The offensive has already killed more than 500 people, including dozens of civilians, while some 300,000 civilians have been displaced within Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor. More than 650,000 Syrian refugees are registered with the UNHCR in Jordan, which shares a 370-kilometer (230-mile) border with Syria.e To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
