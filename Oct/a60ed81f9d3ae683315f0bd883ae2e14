CDQ serves up the video to his Flavour-featured single dubbed Akwaba. On the new record, whose title is translated as “welcome” from Ghana’s Twi dialect, the two tapped Ghanaian highlife influences delivering faultless braggadocious verses, alluding to their star power. The Paul Gambit directed visuals backs up their claims by offering a window into their celebrity lifestyle. Girls, drinks and happy energy in all sufficiency. In the heat of the well publicized hip-hop beef between Vector and MI Abaga – who happen to be key players in the industry, one other player well deserving of public attention is CDQ. Rapper CDQ has made topical social media conversations which are thankfully not negative. Twitter influencer and music commentator, Isima noted in response to the release of CDQ’s new record, Akwaba that the rapper is quite deserving of more credits than he gets, given the degree of his consistency and the array of feats that he’s accomplished. “CDQ doesn’t get enough recognition for his strides. He’s been dropping jams after jams year after year from Indomie to Salaro to Nowo soke to Say Baba to Flex. He also dropped albums in 2016 & 2018. He performed with Wizkid on stage at Afro Nation and was even on Tim Westwood.”  More people appear to share similar sentiment with the influencer as praises pour in for the rapper:     Press play below to watch CDQ’s new video for Akwaba featuring Flavour:
