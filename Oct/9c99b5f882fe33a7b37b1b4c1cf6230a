Facebook And Instagram Bans Sexually Suggestive Emojis | Pinterest Facebook and Instagram have banned some emojis for being too sexually suggestive. The banned emojis include aubergine, peach and the water drip characters. The aubergine and peach emoji were originally created to represent foods, however the characters are mostly used for the sexual connotations associated with them. The change is part of an update to Facebook’s Sexual Solicitation Community Standards , which are aimed at sex workers who use the platforms to sell their services. Facebook explained that: “People use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and exploitation. We recognise the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. “We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates sexual encounters between adults. “We also restrict sexually explicit language that may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to connect with their friends and the broader community.”
