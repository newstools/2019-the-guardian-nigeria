Rivers United Football Club, coach Stanley Eguma Coach Stanley Eguma of Rivers United Football Club of Port Harcourt has stated that his team is preparing for the new Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) 2019/20 season with the recruitment of players, especially from the grassroots. Though, no date has been fixed for the league kickoff, Eguma said he would not take chances saying that he is engaging in pre-season tournaments so as to get his team ready for the task ahead. “River United FC is preparing earnestly for the new season with pre-season activities. We recently took part in the Okowa Cup in Asaba, Delta State and we just finished another one at the Dipo Dino Stadium in Ijebu Ode, Ogun State for the pre-season tournaments. “We are also planning to participate in the AHLAN Cup 2019 Pre-season Tournament in Kano. While we are doing this, we are also looking at the players, knocking them into shape, making sure we impact in them physically, materially, and tactically to ensure that we have a good team,” he said, adding that the club is still in search for players, who can improve the team to do better in the next season. “We are also looking out for good players to team beef up what we have on ground. We are trying to harness them with the old players in the team. This time around we did not go for the big names because I am a person who believes that we can get players, especially from the grassroots, and in the lower leagues. “That does not mean we cannot recruit players also from the premier league if we found one. Rivers United is a big club that is aspiring to go into the continent. “We have extended our drag net to all looks and crannies of Africa and beyond to get good players, but like I said we do not concentrate on big players only, as we have some of them already, who have represented this nation before,” he stated.
