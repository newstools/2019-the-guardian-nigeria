Nick Jonas “The Voice” has announced one of the popular artists as a coach. Nick Jonas will be occupying one of the swivel chairs in the show’s upcoming 18th season in the spring of 2020. Jonas is slated to join returning coaches Blake Shelton, Kelly Clarkson and John Legend. Shelton’s girlfriend Gwen Stefani, who returned as a coach for the fall cycle, will not be returning in the spring. He took to his Instagram page to break this announcement to his followers.   Me thinking about joining @kellyclarkson, @johnlegend, and @blakeshelton on season 18 of @nbcthevoice. So excited to finally get to share this with you all. A post shared by  Nick Jonas (@nickjonas) on Oct 7, 2019 at 6:24pm PDT  According to a statement from the network. Jonas said, “I’m so excited to be a part of ‘The Voice’ family, It’s such an awesome group of individuals, and I can’t wait to help these artists really build and hone in to find their unique voices.” Back in June, Jonas appeared as a musical guest, alongside his brothers, on NBC’s songwriting reality competition series “Songland.” The song they ultimately chose, Able Heart’s “Greenlight,” quickly went to the top of the iTunes charts. So Nick has some familiarity with both the network and musical reality shows on it.
