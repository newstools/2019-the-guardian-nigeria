Former Ivory Coast president and party leader Henri Konan Bedie called for reforms to ensure the independence of the electoral commission ahead of the vote. “Ahead of the next presidential election, the PDCI and its allies are more determined than ever to take up the reins of government,” Bedie said. Former Ivory Coast rebel leader Guillaume Soro, also an ex-president of the country’s parliament, said Friday he will run in the 2020 presidential poll.

Ivory Coast has long been west Africa’s top economic performer and is the world’s leading cocoa producer but it has struggled with political tensions.
