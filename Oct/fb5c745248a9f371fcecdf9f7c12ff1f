The Dark mode feature, in recent times, has become widely accepted with the likes of Twitter making it popular and other applications like Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Android all following suit. As the name suggests, these involve adjusting the color scheme of the software to prioritise blacks and dark greys, rather than whites and light greys. Perhaps the biggest benefit of dark modes is that they emit less blue light, which means your sleep cycle is less likely to be disrupted. As a result, people who use dark mode often do so because it offers them a better experience when using their devices at night. Eye fatigue caused by glare is also reduced by a darker background, while people with medical conditions affected by light, such as those with photophobia, tend to benefit from reduced eye aggravation when using dark modes. Asides the aforementioned advantages, dark colours also have the ability to use less power and since this display works better in low-light settings, it automatically means your device has a high on using up a minimal amount of power. According to University of Cambridge academic, Silas Brown,  if your device has faulty pixels these are often less noticeable when using a dark display – reducing the urgency with which a device needs to be fixed. Some colours stand out more on a black background than on a white one, which is particularly valuable when you are trying to highlight certain pieces of information on a page. Additionally, a dark border can allow for light text to need less margin space than in the opposite scenario – making it easier for designers to use the entire page. Ultimately, however, the largest benefit of software developers offering users a dark mode is that it provides them with a choice based upon their needs.
