The General Overseer, Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Enoch Adeboye, has called on the Federal Government to focus on policies that would lessen the suffering of the masses. Speaking yesterday at the RCCG headquarters, Ebute Metta, Lagos during the thanksgiving service for Nigeria’s 59th independence anniversary, he said that with such policies, the country would take its rightful place in comity of nations.  He was represented by the Assistant General Overseer (Administration and Personnel), Johnson Odesola. At the service graced by monarchs, including the Alake of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Gbadebo, the cleric lamented the state of nation at the of 59, noting that if the country had at least been able to level up with those countries it attained independence at the same time with, the celebration would have been meaningful. He emphasised that a lot of policies being executed currently were not helping suffering Nigerians who seem to be living in a strange country, with the wealth of their nation in few hands. Making reference to the border closure against importation of rice by the President Muhammadu Buhari administration, Adeboye noted that the step caused hardship for Nigerians, as the price of the product has kept skyrocketing. Also, Oba Gbadebo called on the country’s leaders to be committed to the welfare of the citizens.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
