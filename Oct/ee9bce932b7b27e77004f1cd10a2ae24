Some hoodlums around Mile 2 area of Lagos on Tuesday attacked a petrol tanker driver conveying petroleum products. The street boys reportedly hit the tanker multiple times with metal bars to spill the contents on the floor. In a video seen by The Guardian, people have since taken plastic and other vessels to collect petrol products from the spillage. An eyewitness said: “Touts who usually collect money from truck and tanker drivers hit the tanker with an iron and it began to gush fuel.”  “Mile 2 under bridge, PMS tanker spilled (sic) its contents. Urgent attention is needed please,” Felix Aina tweeted at the Lagos State Government. Aina said the situation under the bridge at Mile 2 was a “disaster in the waiting”. “…loaded PMS tanker just spilt the whole content on the road. Swift action is needed.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
