The rapper, Travis Scott, landed wrong while jumping up and down during his performance at New York's Rolling Loud Festival over the weekend. He injured his patellar tendon and may need surgery. According to TMZ,  he went to see orthopedic specialist Dr. Neal ElAttrache this week. ElAttrache diagnosed him with a stretch or tear in the knee. Although they have discussed surgery, doctors would like to wait another day or so to see if it could heal on its own. Scott is hoping they will decide to do the operation because he wants to heal as quickly as possible so that he can perform and play basketball again. It's unclear if the injury will affect Scott's upcoming tour dates, which include the second edition of his annual Astroworld Festival.
