Ghanaian undercover investigative journalist, Anas Aremeyaw Anas has challenged African journalists to constantly beam their searchlight to uncover atrocities and malfeasance perpetrated by influential figures in the society. The award-winning journalist and founder of Ghana-based Tiga Eye Foundation spoke yesterday at the opening of a two-day, MacArthur funded a workshop on Investigative Journalism at the Faculty of Communication, Bayero University, Kano. He contended that African countries may begin to witness enduring growth and better society, devoid of corrupt practices and all indices of underdevelopment the moment journalists expose crimes through investigative journalism. Sharing experiences on ‘Enemies of the Nation’, ‘Betraying the Game’ and ‘Corruption in Ghana Judiciary’, Anas warned that embarking on investigative journalism could lead to paying the supreme price. He stressed that while the voyage of investigative journalism may be unpalatable, the positive impact on society is gratifying. Veteran journalist, Ahmed Aminu viewed journalism as basic tool that promotes accountability, respect for rule of law and empowerment to right the wrong in the society. He, however, believed that practicing investigative journalism might be difficult in Nigeria considering the endemic level of corruption and ills in society. Aminu who chaired the occasion also cited a harsh working environment under which journalists operate as major impediments to undertake investigative journalism in Nigeria.
