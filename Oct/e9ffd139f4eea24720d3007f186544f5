 President Buhari  The use of alternative routes, our correspondent gathered, is due to heightened activities of kidnappers, banditry and other criminal activities in Kaduna and neighbouring states. This may, however, cause hardship for commuters and other road-users in state and environs. Areas affected include Kawo/Mando/Airport roads, Kaduna Airport/Rigachukun/Kawo, and Rigachikun/Kaduna Airport/Airport Roundabout/Birnin Gwari roads. The Academy Public Relations Officer (APRO), Major Abubakar Abdullahi, told journalists yesterday that combined POP for 66 Regular Course, Army, 67 Regular Course and 67 Regular Course (Navy and Air force) would hold on Saturday, October 5, 2019. He added that the parade would attract various dignitaries from across the country and beyond, with President Muhammadu Buhari as special guest of honour. He said, “Consequently, the Kawo/Mando/Airport road will be busy from 5am to 5pm. Road-users who do not have anything to do around the NDA area are advised to use alternative routes to avoid an unnecessary bottleneck. “We appeal to road-users to bear with the situation, as all arrangements to ensure hitch-free event are in place. We wish to remind the public that only guests with a valid invitation will be allowed around the NDA vicinity. Others can equally view live transmission and streaming of the parade on Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) networks and NDA social media platforms.” The release added that NDA expressed regret for the inconveniences that would be caused as the event lasted.
