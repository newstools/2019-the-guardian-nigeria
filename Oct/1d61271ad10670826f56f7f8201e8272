 Pension  The TUC also urged wants the Lagos State Government to make a policy pronouncement that will confer retirees in Lagos with senior citizen status, attached with some privileges such as free access to government medical facilities and transport systems within the state.
 
It added that the social safety net programme is long overdue in a city such as Lagos State. 
 
The communiqué, which was signed by the Chairman and Secretary, Gbenga Ekundayo, and Abiodun Aladetan, respectively, equally noted the challenge of housing to workers in Lagos in view of its centrality.
 
It argued that it has become increasingly glaring that most workers in the state live in dehumanizing conditions due to their inability to access accommodation and housing at a reasonable cost.
 
According to TUC, rent in a city like Lagos is about 60 per cent of an average workers’ disposable income, which is far higher than the 20 to 30 per cent recommended by the United Nations.
 
“This pathetic situation, in terms of shelter cost in Lagos has eliminated the low-income earners from the housing market. Therefore, the workshop calls on the State Government to provide low-cost housing for workers because the current Rent-to-Own Scheme of the Government is far above the reach of workers,” communiqué said. The workshop, themed, “21st-century labour leadership, growth and opportunities and challenges,” also drew the attention of government at all levels to an infrastructural deficit in the areas of healthcare, affordable housing, portable water. In particular, it urged the fixing of bad roads to ease traffic logjam in the state especially in the low budget areas that have served as the nexus for workers.
