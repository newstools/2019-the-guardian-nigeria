This was revealed on Monday by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. The media presenter’s star is in the television category and will be placed on Hollywood Boulevard near stars of “American Horror Story” creator Ryan Murphy and actor Jason Bateman. Williams, who serves as host of the Emmy Award nominated nationally syndicated eponymous daytime talk show, started her career in radio almost 25 years ago. Reaching upwards to 12 million viewers as she rebranded herself as a shock jock of black radio, the Asbury Park, N.J., native became a household name when a 2003 interview with Whitney Houston went off the rails, exposing a previously unseen side of the pop diva. Williams was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in November of 2009 and has written multiple books, including the New York Times best-selling memoir “Wendy’s Got The Heat,” with Karen Hunter. Published by Simon & Schuster, Williams offered jaw-dropping details about her career path, celebrity encounters and crack use. The Northeastern University alum has appeared on various TV shows, including “Martin” and “Dancing with the Stars” and had a cameo in “Think Like a Man,” based on Steve Harvey’s best-selling relationship advice book. In 2013, she was cast as Matron Mama Morton in Broadway’s Tony Award-winning revival of the musical “Chicago.” Currently, Williams, 55, is developing and will executive produce a biopic and a documentary for Lifetime Television, that will focus on her life and her career.
