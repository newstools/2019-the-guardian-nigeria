While so many use it for detox, others eat it to lose weight. This fruit is also very useful for the skin, it’s health benefit on the skin can never be overlooked. Below are some of the health benefits of cucumber on human skin. Treats Blemishes Washing your face daily with cucumber water is a great way to keep blemishes and freckles away. Cucumber’s excellent anti-inflammatory properties can help soothe the skin and give you a glowing and blemish-free skin. This can be done by mixing one tablespoon of oats with some cucumber pulp and let it sit for an hour. Oats can exfoliate and keep your skin clear. Apply this mixture on your face and let it sit for 20 minutes.  Wash your face with cold water. Controls eye puffiness Often, lack of enough rest, stress, too much thinking or alcohol can make the eye puffy. This can make you look unnecessarily tired. Cucumbers lend a cooling effect on the tired and stressed eyes. This is made possible by placing a chilled slice of cucumber on your eyes and allowing it to rest for 10-15 minutes. Reduces dark circles Putting slices of cucumber on eyes not only relieve your eyes from all the stress of the day but could also do wonders for the dark circles beneath it. Cucumber has silica, a compound that helps lightening of dark circles.
