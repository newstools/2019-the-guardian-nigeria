It looks like Tacha is here for the long haul as she signs an endorsement deal with GetFit, a fitness brand that sells fitness equipment.   I’m super excited to be announcing that I am officially on-board as a brand ambassador to Nigeria’s BIGGEST fitness wearables solutions Getfit Technologies @getfitng. I’ve always admired TeamFitFAM and I’m so pleased to be starting this journey..

The partnerships came after Teeblizz, the ex-husband of the popular singer, Tiwa Savage, became her manager. In spite of what happened in the house, the partnerships could be because of her strong fanbase. Her fans are elated about this news and have been retweeting this partnership on Twitter.
