…Oshiomhole Harps On Credible Polls
As the Kogi and Bayelsa states governorship polls draws nearer, the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, has insisted that the outcome of the polls must be in line with the wishes and aspirations of the people of the two states. Speaking during the inauguration of the party’s campaign councils for the states at its national secretariat in Abuja, he maintained that the electorate should be allowed to cast their ballots under a peaceful atmosphere.He said the party’s governorship candidate in Bayelsa State has the wherewithal to sweep the poll, even as he stressed that thuggery would not decide the outcome of the governorship election this time. On Kogi, he said it behooves the electorate to cast their votes for Governor Yahaya Bello, who he noted, had learnt the ropes of governance in his first term in office rather than opt for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Musa Wada. Governor Mohammed Badaru, who was mandated to lead the Bayelsa governorship campaign council, promised to deploy what he termed “political dexterity” to ensure that the votes count on election day. Governor Nasir Ahmad el-Rufai, who would lead a-56 member Kogi governorship campaign council, also pledged to deliver the state to the APC with a wider margin compared to the votes scored by the party in the 2015 poll.Noting that Kogi was a familiar terrain, he said he would nail the coffin of the PDP in the state, just as he described Bello as a true friend who stood by President Muhammadu Buhari in his trying times through thick and thin.
