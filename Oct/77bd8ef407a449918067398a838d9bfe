The Presidency has warned that projects would be reallocated if any state government or communities create unnecessary impediments to its execution. “The idea of chasing away contractors, making undue demands from them by local communities or state governments deliberately frustrating the allocation of lands for federal projects is an antithesis of the people’s welfare,” the President warned. In a recent directive to ministers, President Muhammadu Buhari requested ministers to get states to clear all lingering land issues threatening federal projects under their supervision or have such projects moved to willing states where that becomes impossible. He regretted that some communities were frustrating the siting of federal projects in their areas by making impossible demands for land compensation from contractors and even chasing them away, where they are unable to meet up. The Presidency, in a statement by Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, yesterday, noted that the refusal to allocate lands for federal projects or the growing hostility by communities against contractors are hurting the interests of the people governments were elected to serve.
