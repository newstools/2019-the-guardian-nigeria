 One of the boxers expected to feature in the maiden GOtv Night Mini event, Opeyemi ‘Sense’ Adeyemi  Speaking in an interview in Lagos yesterday, Mensah, who represented Nigeria at the 1972 Olympic Games, said the event was a pertinent intervention for boxing in Nigeria, adding that it will provide them the opportunity to rack up more fights and compete against their colleagues. He said: “It’s a nice programme which would help Nigerian boxing. There are just a few events such as GOtv Boxing Night and GOtv Boxing NextGen Search, which have promoted boxers in the country. A lot of boxers have turned pro in Nigeria but they haven’t got a chance to compete on the big stage. Therefore, the new entrant (GOtv Boxing Night Mini) is a welcome development for the sport as boxers will be able to test themselves against their fellow professionals.” The veteran boxing coach also lauded the sponsors for their contribution towards the development of boxing in Nigeria, as it gives them the chance to improve on their professional record. Boxers scheduled to fight at GOtv Boxing Night Mini include Rilwan “Real One” Oladosu, West African Boxing Union (WABU) lightweight champion; Rilwan “Baby Face” Babatunde, West African Boxing Union (WABU) welterweight champion; Waheed “Skoro” Usman, former African Boxing Union (ABU) featherweight champion; Kabiru “KB Godson” Towolawi, Opeyemi “Sense” Adeyemi and Sikiru “Omo Iya Eleja” Shogbesan.
