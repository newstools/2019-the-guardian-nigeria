The Barca Academy in Nigeria is led by Leslie Oghomienor, who is the chairman, Blaugrana Group International. The Academy, which started at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos three years ago, now has two additional facilities in Children International School, Lekki and Corona School, Gbagada, which houses the Elite 96 Scholarship Project initiated for exceptional and gifted children irrespective of their background. Speaking in Lagos at the weekend, an excited Villa described Nigeria as his second home, adding that he would always look forward to seeing his ‘children,’ the pioneer students of the Academy.
 “I have travelled far and wide, training young and very young people, but I have discovered that the Nigerian child is exceptional in energy, skills and talent, and proper honing is all he needs to live his dream and make Nigeria very tall in the spheres of concern,” he stated. In his response, Oghomienor expressed his delight that within a short period the Academy has made tremendous impact locally and internationally because of the technical team led by Villa.“His success here is what informed his elevation. In this, we are very proud. This is a clear indicator that we have walked a few good miles away from our point we took off three years ago. We are very grateful to our stakeholders,” he stressed.He also revealed that the academy’s new season began barely a few weeks ago in all the three facilities in Lagos.
