 David Ugolor  ANEEJ Executive Director, David Ugolor, in a statement yesterday raised concerns over the disheartening report on the appropriation of funds by the NDDC and other Niger Delta Institutions and it’s the inability to put the money to good use to meet the collective hopes and aspirations of the people of the Niger-Delta. According to him, the report aligns with Citizen Report Card on Niger Delta Institutions published by ANEEJ with support of LITE-Africa in 2015. He said the report found out that across the board, most projects being executed by the NDDC and NDIs were either being abandoned, executed in a sub-standard way or were incomplete. Ugolor further lamented that the 2018 extra 18 percent budgetary allocation has not matched the projects on the ground, wondering what the region is doing with the 13% derivation fund. Ugolor added ‘In addition to the Edo state government’s call for a probe of the NDDC, we call on the federal government to vigorously pursue the blacklisting of all contractors, and the banks as well, which have in one way or the other, worked with these contractors to execute substandard projects. He noted that 2015, ANEEJ had recommended that the NDDC be open and transparent and to do proper consultation with communities before embarking on projects, and ensure independent monitoring teams participate in project supervision during project implementations to ensure compliance and quality assurance to avoid substandard or incomplete/abandoned projects.
