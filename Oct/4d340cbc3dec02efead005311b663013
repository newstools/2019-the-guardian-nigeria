Former international midfielder, Friday Ekpo has called on the Golden Eaglets to avoid complacency in their remaining games at the ongoing 2019 U-17 World Cup holding in Brazil. Ekpo, who commended the Eaglets for their victory over Hungary in their World Cup opener at the weekend, said the Nigerian lads would have lost the encounter owing to confusion in the defence that  made the team concede two goals. He noted that the team’s commitment and hunger for victory in the championship will spur the Eaglets excel in the cadet championship.Ekpo charged the Eaglets to maintain the winning momentum and strive for glory in Brazil.“The Eaglets’ victory over Hungary has helped to instill confidence in the boys.They should not allow the win in their first game to get into their heads. “As they move on in the championship, the competition will get tougher. So the players need to be instructed to approach every game with total commitment.
“The Eaglets should also be careful not to make mistakes in the defence because they might not be lucky to score vital goals like they did against Hungary when they meet a more tactically organised team,” he said.
