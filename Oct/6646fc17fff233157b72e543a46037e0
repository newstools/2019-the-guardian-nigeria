This year’s theme: “Our Actions Our Future: Healthy Diets For A Zero Hunger World,” reflects the need for collective action towards increasing food production in addition to ensuring the quality of food being consumed. At the Lagos Farm Fair, organised by Lagos State Government, in partnership with British American Tobacco Nigeria (BATN) Foundation, held at the Police College Ground, Ikeja, to mark the day, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu said the theme highlights the state’s efforts through the food security initiative and commitment to prevent the consumption of unwholesome food. He said the only way to effectively fight poverty and hunger in the country is to boost agricultural production and prevent post-harvest losses and wastage, which constitute a major threat to the achievement of food security objectives. “We have to imbibe the lessons learned from the dwindling returns from oil to encourage family participation in farming so that most of our basic needs could be met locally and we would be independent of others to feed ourselves. “We have also put this to practice in our schools where we have established different farming enterprises to train and teach the students in modern farming techniques,” Sanwo-Olu explained. The Technical Committee Member, BATNF, Mr. Fatai Afolabi, who disclosed that in the second quarter of 2019, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from the sector rose from N3.5m in the first quarter to over N3.8m, adding that the sector is capable of contributing more if farm produce can get to consumers regularly. “We all appreciate that no matter how fantastic a product is if it does not get to its end-users at the appropriate time, that product will rot away in storage. This prompted our collaboration with the state government and other sponsors for this fair. We have always identified with smallholder farmers and we will continue to do all we can to promote agricultural enterprise by encouraging a commercial mindset in subsistence farmers and support them to run their farms as sustainable agribusinesses. Executive Director of BATNF, Abimbola Okoya, emphasised collaboration between the private and public sectors to find a lasting solution to hunger and malnutrition, and also to step up agriculture’s contribution to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). She noted that the company’s support for the fair is part of their contribution towards achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal, which aims to end hunger in the country. Similarly, Farmcrowdy, a digital agriculture platform, visited Victoria Island Nursery and Primary School, Eti Osa Local Government Area to commemorate the day, said food security is not just about having access to food but having access to healthy food. “Despite 820 million people not having enough to eat, about 2.1 billion people are obese. Dietary choices and lifestyles have caused an increase in obesity around the world. This year’s theme calls us not only to take action towards #ZeroHunger but to make sure our diet is healthy. “We have been able to educate the children on agriculture, World Food Day, and the role they can play towards achieving #ZeroHunger, as well as activities they can engage in to stay healthy.” Farmcrowdy’s co-founder, Temitope Omotolani, among other staff, educate the pupils about the importance of a balanced diet and gave tips on some actions they should take for a better and healthier living. In Ogun State, the state Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun said his administration is focusing on food security, self-sufficiency, sustainability, and the adoption of a value- chain approach to agriculture. The Governor, who disclosed this at the Farmers Market, Asero, Abeokuta, noted that the commercialisation of large-scale agriculture and provision of advisory and extension services is part of plans put in place in addressing hunger in the state. Represented by the Head of Service, Engr. Lanre Bisiriyu, Abiodun said among other things, the state has focused on three arable crops and three livestock with a high competitive advantage in addition to establishing and revamping farm settlements.
