NYSC members are currently being paid N19,800 monthly as allowance by the federal government The new minimum wage was approved on April 18 and will be implemented following an agreement between organised labour and the Federal Government on the consequential adjustments. The Federal Executive Council (FEC) presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo issued an order that the minimum wage should be paid from April since that was when it was approved. Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, while briefing State House correspondents on the development, said FEC had already asked the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission to effect the payments, including arrears owed workers, reflecting the consequential adjustments. He said a deadline of December 2019 was also set to effect all payments while the benchmarks would be forwarded to state governments to guide them in their own implementation.
