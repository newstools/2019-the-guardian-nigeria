For men involved in such a relationship, it is either one of two things; they got attracted, dated without knowing at the start of the relationship that she is married or they consciously pursued a relationship with the woman with the knowledge of her marital status. While it may seem thrilling and “living on the edge”, here are a few reasons why one should avoid dating a married woman: Home Breaker You should know that you are potentially wrecking a home. By maintaining an affair with a married woman you put her in a position where she has less time and affection for marital vows, thereby undermining her commitment to her home.
