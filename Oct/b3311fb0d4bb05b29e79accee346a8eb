Leading the call, the facilitator, Mrs. Temitope Okunnu said composting, for instance, is a great way by which student that engage in environmental practice could reduce food waste and contribute to the mitigation of Green House Gas Emissions (GHGE). According to her, waste food materials such as eggshells, banana peels, vegetables, bread, yard waste, coffee grounds, manure from rabbits and chickens are very good for composting. She equally talked about the rules guiding composting which include “turning compost from the bottom part to the top part, to ensure the adequate ratio of nitrogen to carbon present in the compost.” Addressing the participants, Okunnu said there was the need to devise new method of using bottle caps for making jewelries, tables from tyres and improving cleanup activities. She emphasised the importance of promoting environmental awareness in school premises, regional meetings amongst coordinators, waste recycling and raising a school garden by using waste materials. The training also featured inauguration of new school conservation clubs, grouping of schools into districts and presentation of gifts to some coordinators for their performance in the previous year.
