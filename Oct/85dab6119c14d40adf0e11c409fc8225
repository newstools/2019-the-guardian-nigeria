The students and staff of Engravers College, Kaduna, who were recently abducted by kidnappers, regained their freedom, yesterday. The state Commissioner, Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan disclosed this in a statement, although he could not disclose whether a ransom was paid or not. According to Aruwan, the victims, most of who are minors, and their families will now be focusing on recovering from the undeserved trauma they experienced. While appealing for considerate reporting of their ordeal and respect for their privacy, he said: “We are relieved that this criminal violation of the right to liberty is over and that they are all back safely. As we continue to combat banditry, kidnapping and other crimes, the Kaduna State Government urges all our communities not to give comfort to criminals, by dividing victims and inserting ethno-religious narratives for the activities of ruthless miscreants…” He called for vigilance in all communities and continued cooperation with security agencies “in this battle to secure our state and all who live in it.” Meanwhile, sources said the victims had been taken to the Police Command for debriefing. Meanwhile, the Kaduna Police Command has confirmed the rescue of the six students and two teachers, saying they have been reunited with their families. A statement by the Police spokesman, DSP Yakubu Sabo, said armed security teams of Police Operatives attached to Operation Puff Adder Kaduna, acted on intelligence and intercepted the kidnapped students at Dutse in Chukun Local Government Area. He said: “The Command wishes to assure the general public that efforts are on to apprehend the perpetrators of this crime and bring them to book.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
