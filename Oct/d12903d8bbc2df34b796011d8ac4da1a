A school supervisor at Chrisland International School, Lekki, Mr. Adegboyega Adenekan, aged 47, accused of defiling a two-year-old girl has been sentenced to 60 years imprisonment by Justice Sybil Nwaka of Lagos Sexual and Domestic Offences Court, Ikeja. In her judgment, Justice Nwaka held that the prosecution had proved the case of defilement against the convict beyond reasonable doubt. It was a celebrated case during which the toddler testified before the court giving graphic description of how she was molested by the convict when she said: “He put his weewee in my weewee.” Adenekan was alleged to have defiled the girl under the guise of teaching her sex education. He was arrested by the then Divisional Police Officer (DPO), CSP Akinbayo Olasoji, following a complaint by the victim’s mother at the Ikeja Police Division. The Guardian gathered that Olasoji, now an Assistant Commissioner of Police and his team were celebrating when they heard of the ruling by the judge.
 
The judge described the school supervisor as “wicked, conscienceless and an animal who is not worthy of walking on the street of Lagos.” She held that the basic elements to consider in this case is that the accused had sex with the child; that there was penetration; that the evidence of the child must be corroborated. She further said: “Children are put in care of teachers and I find the act of the defendant as wicked who is not fit to be walking around freely.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
