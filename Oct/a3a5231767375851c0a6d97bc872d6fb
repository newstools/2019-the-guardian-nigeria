Atlanta Church Rejects Kanye West’s Donation Over Pro-Trump Comments | People A church in Atlanta has decided to redirect the money Kanye West donated to them elsewhere after the rapper made some pro-Donald Trump remarks at a Sunday Service event in Salt Lake City, Utah on Oct. 5. Speaking to a crowd at the Utah Sunday service West reaffirmed his support for Trump: “Abraham Lincoln was the Whig Party—that’s the Republican Party that freed the slaves… I ain’t never make a decision based only on my color. That’s a form of slavery—mental slavery. I ain’t drink from the white person fountain. … I ain’t playing with them. All these mind controllers, the media, all of these mind controllers. I find that wherever Christ is where I’ve got my mind at. We find that the love of Christ is where I’ve got my mind back.” However, Atlanta’s New Birth Missionary Baptist Church Pastor Jamal Bryant explained in a social media video he uploaded some time last week, that West gave a large donation to his ministry after his performance there back in September. In his subsequent video, Bryant issued a statement saying that he’s redirecting West’s donation to Morris Brown College because of the rapper’s support of Trump. “To say that you unashamedly support Donald Trump…he called the mother continent of Africa a collection of s-hole nations. Smacking the entire diaspora in the year of the anniversary of the year of the return,” Bryant said. “I don’t align with the statements of Kanye West. I don’t endorse it, nor do I subscribe to it. And I am not a runaway slave. To that end, Mr. West made a significant donation to New Birth Cathedral. But I do not want to be guilty of double speech. I met with my team today and the donation that he made to our church, I am now redirecting. I’m going to be giving that donation he gave to Morris Brown College.”
