 Director General, NAFDAC, Prof. Mojisola Christianah Adeyeye  She said in line with the ease of doing business, the agency created the Small Business Support Desk (SBSD) whose function is to facilitate registration processes for micro and small business operators through engagements such as MSME Clinics, Exhibitions, and NAFDAC Product Registration Outreach (NaPRO). Adeyeye stated this at the sensitisation programme on NAFDAC guidelines for registration of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) regulated products at Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos, yesterday, adding that the laboratory analysis of MSME products is expeditiously treated with utmost urgency. She said: “For the ease of the MSME products exportation, the agency has reviewed the guidelines such that applicants can make submission at the NAFDAC zonal offices and processed at the Ports Inspection Directorate (PID) within a timeline of 28 working days. This is believed to enhance the business and generate foreign exchange into the Nigerian economy”. “We are fully embracing institutional regulatory reforms for sustainability and are entrenching a Quality Management System (QMS) that is making our members of staff to think of the customer first in all its operations. This has led to certification on ISO 9001:2015 obtained on June 7, 2019.  Being a customer-focused, agency-minded business strategy, the goal has resulted in continuous improvement in overall performance to provide a stable foundation for entrenching a quality culture within the scope of our activities.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
