 The abandoned baby  Nwaokorie, on sighting the child crawling on the ground without any guardian, quickly recovered the child, alerted passersby and later took her to a nearby Ogbaku Police Station, where preliminary care was given to the baby. As at press time, no person had reported claiming ownership of the child. Nwaokorie said: “I came around the uncompleted building around Orogwe Secondary School where I saw the baby crawling on the ground. I looked around, nobody was seen. It was a strange sight on a Sunday. There was no commercial or religious activity in that area. The school nearby was shut and the uncompleted building was deserted. I quickly carried the baby, alerted people around in case they knew the bay, nobody did, then I took the baby to Ogbaku Police Station and left the baby in the care of the police.” The baby should be between eight and nine months old.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
