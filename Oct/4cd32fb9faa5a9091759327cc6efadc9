Speaking after his team’s match, Coach Solomon Yola of Pillars said the win was a good start to the final phase of the championship. He lauded his players for their effort, adding that despite their late arrival to the venue of the championship, his boys still put up a good result. “We are happy to record our first win. Beating Shooters was exciting. We arrived Lagos early this morning (yesterday) because we had a problem with our vehicle on our way. But it was good to arrive safely and win our opening game. “We ended the first phase as leaders, hopefully, Lagos will be a good hunting ground for us as we approach all our game with vigour. “It took us a lot of hard work, but we hope that we can sustain the tempo and come out top as the overall winner. In tomorrow (today) game, hopefully, we will rest well and be ready in our game against Borno Spiders,” he said.
