Hacey Health Initiative has debunked the misconception that longtime use of contraceptive can lead to infertility. Rather, ladies using contraceptives should stop using it or get the implants removed, which allows the body returns to its normal function. Programmme Officer and Social Worker of the initiative, Folashade Adebanjo stated this at an outreach programme in Zumuratu, a community in Ajegunle, Lagos, where about 200 girls, mostly out-of-school, were enlightened on the importance of formal and informal education, sexual reproductive health and rights, which are key factors that improve the health, wellbeing and education of the girl child. According to her, such misconception could deter girls from using contraceptives. She disclosed that the community was chosen because it is a disadvantaged community, slum with a high number of out-of-school girls. The discussion centered on puberty, menstrual health, hygiene, hormonal imbalance, health care seeking behaviour, and STIs/HIV. The session on ‘sexual and reproductive health and rights’ facilitated by Adebanjo generated discussion among participants. Michael Rosemary complained high vaginal discharge even after she went to the hospital and got tested. The facilitator advised that she go back to the hospital and ask to see a gynecologist. Participants were advised to always take their health seriously and desist from self-medication, avoid health complications and lifelong damages.
