Magaji Alliyu (APC Jigawa), gave NEMSA eight hours to make necessary corrections in the budget and reappear before it at 7.30 p.m. This followed a unanimous adoption of a motion by Rep. Wale Raji (APC Lagos) at the budget defence session of the committee. The chairman noted that the agency’s 2020 budget was “laden with errors and as good as a `copy and paste’ document.’’ He frowned at the overhead items which he noted were listed as capital expenditure items in the budget.
“I think something is wrong. “This presentation is not acceptable to me and to this committee; budget defence is not a jamboree but a constitutional responsibility. “With the full complement of staff (members) of the agency, this is not acceptable,’’ he said. The chairman directed the agency to liaise with the committee’s consultant and other support staff to correct the errors in the budget. Mr Peter Ewesor, the Managing Director of NEMSA, apologised for the errors and promised to correct them and re-appear before the committee.
