This was as Governor Makinde maintained that free qualitative education has come to stay in the state, noting that education remains the best form of poverty alleviation and empowerment that can be given to youths. In a statement by the Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, Osinbajo and Makinde were guests of the Presiding Bishop of the Victory International Church, Bishop Taiwo Victor Adelakun, at the 30th Anniversary of the Church/ Divine Proclamation Service for Dominion University, held at the Rehoboth Cathedral, Ibadan. Osinbajo said that he was happy that the governor had taken up the challenge of providing free qualitative education in Oyo State. According to Osinbajo, though President Muhammadu Buhari, on June 20, 2019, declared that education would be free across the country for the first nine years, covering primary to junior secondary school, the Federal Government could not force states to key into the declaration. Makinde maintained that his administration would make necessary investments in education without caring who takes the credit. He promised to lay the right foundations for free education policy to thrive. Makinde congratulated Bishop Adelakun, saying the proclamation of Dominion University would be the beginning of the production of the kind of leaders that Nigerians want. He said Oyo State Government would support the university. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
