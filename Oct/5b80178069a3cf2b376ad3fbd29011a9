The E! People’s Choice Awards 2019 is set to honour Gwen Stefani the Fashion Icon award at its upcoming event, the network announced on Tuesday. “Honestly it’s bizarre, it’s crazy,” the stylish superstar said of the award in a video interview with E! “It makes me think back to Anaheim, just looking through Vogue magazine and thinking, ‘…I’ll never get my hands on those clothes, I’m just gonna go to the thrift store and make my own clothes’…So to get to this point where I’m getting an award for fashion is kind of surreal, and it just proves that if you are just true to who you are and just follow your own passion, that weird thing can happen.” In the world of style and fashion, of course, the singer is best known for her long-running fashion line L.A.M.B. and its sister label Harajuku Lovers, as well as her own influential, boundary-breaking fashion sense. So, it is safe to say it is a well-deserved win, even though some fashion critics may think otherwise. The 2019 E! People’s Choice Awards will be broadcast live on Sunday, Nov. 10 at 9:00 p.m. ET/PT on E!, with the red carpet starting two hours prior.
