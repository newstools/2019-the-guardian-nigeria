36-year-old Oscar award-winning actress, Lupita Nyong’O is a woman of many talents but we already know this. What we didn’t know is that she can RAP! Okay, maybe Lupita can’t rap but her alter ego, ‘Troublemaker’ surely can and this was known when the actress appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon to showcase her amazing talent as an author and blessed us with a freestyle rap. Academy Award–winning actress Lupita Nyong’o displaying her Sulwe book cover I Courtesy The Kenyan is currently doing press rounds for the promotion of her forthcoming children’s book,  Sulwe as well as her upcoming Hulu feature film Little Monsters. Sulwe drops on October 15, while Little Monsters will debut on Hulu on October 11. During her appearance on the talk show, the ’12 Years A Slave’ star spoke about Sulwe saying: “Sulwe is a powerful, moving picture book about colourism, self-esteem, and learning that true beauty comes from within. Sulwe is a character near and dear to my heart, and seeing her brought to life through Vashti’s illustrations is thrilling”. She had the crowd roaring during her interview when she introduced ‘Troublemaker’ her freestyle-rapping-cat-eye sunglasses-wearing alter-ego. ‘That’s a dope beat,’ she said as she began to vibe with the beat The Roots played in the background. The screen star then went on to show us just how gifted she is as she threw down some rhymes that included a shout-out to Jay-Z and Beyoncé for referencing her on The Lion King: The Gift track Brown Skin Girl as well as a plug for her new book. Watch the video below:  In January 2018, Lupita revealed that she would be writing a book about the struggles she experienced with her complexion and self-image in 2014. In a post on her Instagram feed on April 1st 2019, Lupita shared the illustration cover of Sulwe that depicts an African girl reaching for what could be the stars. The book’s cover illustration was done by Vashti Harrison, an artist and filmmaker from Onley, Virginia.
