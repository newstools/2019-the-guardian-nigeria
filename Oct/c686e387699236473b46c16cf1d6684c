 IGP, Muhammed Adamu (Right)  The call came by a group of investors and indigenes who are not happy over the current activities of the land speculators in the state, especially Igbo-Etche axis, a situation that may seriously alienate the whole community. According to an aggrieved resident, Udofia Abang, some persons identified as land grabbers have been going about seizing genuinely purchased property from owners using questionable injunctions from a particular customary court. He said not less than six big estates and almost all the small estates bought by non-indigene investors along Igbo-Etche axis in Rivers have fallen victims and are been over-ran by the group. While lamenting the situation, Abang said the land grabbers are also using the police and judiciary to perpetuate their activities, which he referred to as xenophobic fixation on land grabbing.He said: “It is typical of this group to seek and collect rogue injunctions from the customary court without the knowledge of owners of the properties and thereafter use SARS operatives to protect them while they overrun peoples’ land with maximum intimidation. “The land grabbers after intimidating the investors would quickly mobilize equipment and bulldoze through people’s property with wanton and malicious destruction on their build up structures. This is why we are calling on the police boss, Rivers State governor, traditional rulers and the state’s Commissioner of Police to step in urgently to stop the gross abuse of people’s investment and stand up against this evil raging to destroy the good image of the state.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
