When the journalist made an attempt to leave the courtroom, Taiwo and her children rushed at her and started insulting the journalist again.

The third defendant, Michael, while argument was ongoing, took a picture of the journalist and said he was going to post it online, called her unprintable names, while Ruth, the fourth defendant, said she was going to make some investigation concerning the journalist and deal with her, adding that by the time she is done with her, she won’t be able to report cases again. The journalist replied that she had no business with them, and that they cannot threaten or tell her how to report a case she witnessed in court . Earlier, a prosecution witness, Mr. Joseph Omorose, had told the court that he doesn’t know where the body of the late Joseph Idehen was. He was led-in-evidence by police prosecutor, Morufu Animashaun, the legal officer of the General Investigation Department of Force CIID. He told the court that the deceased died two weeks after his visit to Benin. In his explanation before Justice Adedayo Akintoye about the Benin customs, he said when a man dies, his first son will inform the family of the man of what led to his death. He continued that when the second and third defendants came to inform him about the death of his cousin, he asked them what led to his death, but they informed him that they weren’t there when he died, that it was the fourth defendant that was with him when he died. The witness was cross-examined by the defence counsel, Mr. Kennedy Osunwa. He further said when he heard about the death of SP Idehen, he asked the defendants to bring his body so that autopsy can be conducted, but till today, they are yet to see the body. He was asked how many wives the deceased had, he said the deceased had six women who gave birth for him. The defence counsel also asked him whether the witness was present at the burial, to which he replied: “It is from your mouth that I am hearing that he was buried.
