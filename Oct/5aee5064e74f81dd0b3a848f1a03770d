(Photo by Paul ELLIS / AFP) / Paul Pogba will remain sidelined until December, Manchester United coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admitted Sunday. The 26-year-old French World Cup winner has not played for the club since September 30 due to an ankle injury and was missing again as United won 3-1 win at Norwich, their first Premier League away win of the season. “I don’t think we’ll see him maybe before December,” said Solskjaer. “He’ll be out for a while. He needs time to fully, fully recover, so don’t think he’ll be back… maybe Sheffield United (on November 24) after the international break but probably December before you can see him.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
