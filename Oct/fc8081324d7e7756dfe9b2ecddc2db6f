Selena Gomez | Photo – Cosmopolitan With the lyrics in Selena Gomez’s latest singles, “Lose You to Love Me” and “Look At Her Now”, many people think they are about her relationship with her ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber. With lyrics like “You turned me down, and now it’s showing / In two months you replaced us / Like it was easy,” it is convenient to think these songs are about the couple’s past relationship. In a recent interview with Zach Sang, Gomez opened up about writing her new music and said she hopes the individual she wrote the song to gets a chance to listen. Selena was also asked, “Is it hard being so open in songs and putting it all out there, being in the public eye, and people are going to make assumptions about who you’re singing about, what you’re singing about?” And in her word, “No. It used to, and it would cripple me and I’d have so much fear about it because I thought people would judge me…I’ve allowed myself to shut all of that out.” Meanwhile, in a separate chat with Zane Lowe, without explicitly stating Justin’s name, Gomez revealed how she came to terms with finally calling it quits on their decade-long romance. She said “I think I had experienced years of it already so I wasn’t really thrown off, but I was just exhausted. My heart was just so tired, and I think that allowing myself to just say that was important for me.”
