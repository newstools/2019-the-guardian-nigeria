While the driver of the commercial bus which took one-way fled the scene immediately, he left the second driver, Tony Maxwell, to count his losses of a damaged car and several passengers with various degrees of injuries  from the crash. “I saw the driver  when he was running away with his conductor,” an eyewitness told The Guardian. “Three people were injured and a woman got injured around her waist and might have some fractions at the spinal cord area,” he added. The victims were said to have been taken to the hospital via tricycle when there was no presence of ambulance. Maxwell was not able to speak to The Guardian due to the accident shock. The Nigeria Police came to the accident scene a few minutes later to inspect and also ordered the removal of the buses to avoid traffic congestion.
