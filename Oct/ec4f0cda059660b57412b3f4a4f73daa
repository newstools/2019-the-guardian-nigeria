Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni, has asked the Nigerian Air Force to establish an airforce base in the state to strengthen its fight against Boko Haram insurgency and enhance internal security. The governor also wants the airforce to establish a command secondary school “to enable our people benefit from the numerous services that such schools render in other parts of the country”. Buni made this known yesterday when he received the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Baba Abubakar, at the Government House in Damaturu, the state capital. “I believe it would be faster and easier for the Air Force to take out Boko Haram bases and hideouts and strengthen our internal security system if we have an Air Force Base in place”, he said. The governor commended the airforce, army and other branches of the nation’s security forces for their hard work, saying Yobe and the rest of the country are now a lot safer because of their services. “The Nigerian Airforce plays a very important role in the fight against the Boko Haram insurgency. They are patriots who continue to do our country proud by undertaking those aerial campaigns to take out terrorist and insurgent camps. “We are a lot safer today in Yobe and the rest of the country because of your services. As you continue the effort to defeat Boko Haram, we would continue to strengthen the synergy, collaboration and exchange of information that are the hallmarks of our relationship. On his part, the Chief of Air Staff assured the governor that the airforce will continue to do “everything humanly possible” to secure the North-East.
