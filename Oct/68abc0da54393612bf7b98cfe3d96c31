I remember in the locker room of the Australian Open (when a tearful Murray played in pain and loss in a five-set first-round match in January). “It was very confusing for him and for all of us. I’m extremely happy for him,” Federer said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
