France, who sit second in Group H, visit third-placed Iceland on Friday before hosting group leaders Turkey on Monday. “He left for the simple reason that he wasn’t ready,” said Deschamps. The France boss added that Mbappe “will need more time” and “wasn’t comfortable”. Mbappe has been replaced in the squad by Borussia Moenchengladbach striker Alassane Plea, who made his only previous international appearance in a friendly against Uruguay last November. World Cup-winner Mbappe initially returned with substitute appearances against Bordeaux last month and Galatasaray last week, but PSG coach Thomas Tuchel then said he “needed more treatment” before he missed the win over Angers.
