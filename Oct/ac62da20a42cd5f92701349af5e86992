Scene where three trailers fell into a huge crater on Agege motor road yesterday. PHOTO: TOBI AWODIPE It was a scene of the absurd yesterday when a bad spot on the ever-busy Agege Motor Road claimed three trucks, which all fell into the huge crater on the road one after the other. Tragedy was averted when a trailer carrying a container first fell into a huge ditch just before Idi-Oro bus stop and landed on a tricycle, which was thankfully not carry any passengers. Another trailer brought to offload contents of the previously fallen container also fell into the crater while a third trailer, which was brought to lift the other two off the road also fell at the same spot, bringing the number of fallen trailers at the bad spot to three. This absurd situation brought the whole stretch of Agege motor road to a complete standstill with traffic stretching to all adjoining routes and spilling far beyond Ojuelegba. The road, which was commissioned less than 10 years ago, has become an eyesore and completely deteriorated beyond belief. The drainagers have clogged up, filling the road with wastewater and has become a heavy burden on commuters and motorists. From Idi-Oro down to Ojuwoye and beyond, the road is completely riddled with craters and deep holes that regularly swallow up cars daily. Street urchins have taken advantage of the situation and for #100, will show motorists where to pass to prevent them falling into the many gutters and craters covered by stagnant floodwater. The situation has also spiked up transport fares for the few commercial buses that still manage to ply the road.
