 [FILES] Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE)  The All Share Index (ASI) decreased by 140.06 absolute points, representing a dip of 0.53 per cent to close at 26,244.39 points. Similarly, market capitalisation also lost N68 billion to close at N12.776 trillion. The downtrend was impacted by losses recorded in large and medium capitalised stocks, amongst which were; MTN Nigeria, Guaranty Trust Bank, Lafarge Africa, The Nigerian Aviation Handling Company (NAHCO), and United Bank for Africa (UBA). On the market performance, Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion, said: “We expect the mixed performance to continue, as the market reacts to released numbers in expectation of more quarterly reports ahead of month-end portfolio alignments, especially as the NSE’s new lows offer investors opportunities to position for short and medium-to-long-term views. “Given that earnings and economic news can change trend at any time, investors should keep their gaze on fundamentally sound and dividend-paying stocks for possible capital appreciation, as third quarter (Q3) numbers give insight into companies’ position and future expectations.” However, market breadth closed positive, with 13 gainers versus 10 losers.
