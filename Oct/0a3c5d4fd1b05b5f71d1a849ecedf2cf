The Elite Schools Cup Association (ESCA) has allayed the fears of some parents over their wards’ safety in Queen’s College, which is one of the venues for the competition. Some parents recently expressed concern over the safety of their children following the recent outbreak of water borne diseases in the school. But the organisers of the Elite Schools Cup have assured that it is part of their responsibility to provide clean and healthy environment for the athletes, officials and spectators to compete, hence they embarked on a solidarity visit to Queen’s College to certify it as suitable for the competition.
   
The Chief Executive Officer, Elite Schools Cup Association, Olayinka Shokoya and some delegates, including principals and proprietors of the participating schools, led the visit to Queen’s College.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
