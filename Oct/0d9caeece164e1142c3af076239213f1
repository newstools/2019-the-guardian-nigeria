And this can be really tiring especially when it gets to the point where they recommend some soap to a different type of cream they believe would work best. It is one of the many reasons why you should consider natural homemade remedies as a treatment before settling for products recommended by people which might worsen the existing condition. Skin rashes and allergies are often caused by problems such as psoriasis, eczema, acne, irritation from soaps or cosmetics, bacterial or viral infections. Here are six (6) of the best home remedies for skin rashes: Olive Oil Well packed with vitamin E and antioxidants, olive oil helps with healing and promoting skin renewal. It soothes the skin and reduces itching providing you with relief from these skin rashes.

You could also add a pinch of turmeric powder to olive oil and apply two to three times a day for a few days. This antibacterial, anti-inflammatory mixture soothes and relieves you of these skin rashes. Oatmeal When considering homemade remedies for skin inflammation and irritation, oatmeal cannot be left out. It’s soothing, anti-inflammatory properties make it helpful in treating rashes caused by sunburn, eczema, chickenpox, and allergies. Mix a cup of finely ground oatmeal in warm bath water and soak yourself in it for 15 to 20 minutes then rinse off with a lukewarm shower. For rashes on the face, mix equal amounts of oatmeal and plain yoghurt with a little amount of honey and apply directly on your face. Leave for about 10 minutes before finally washing it off. Apple Cider Vinegar A common remedy for treating skin rashes and easing itches, raw and organic apple cider vinegar is a must-have in every home. Its acetic acid content counters skin infections or allergies that might cause or worsen the rash. Dip a cotton ball in apple cider vinegar and place it on the affected area and leave on for 2 to 3 minutes before rinsing it off. If it irritates your skin, dilute it with water before applying on your skin. However, if this irritation continues, stop applying it. Coconut Oil Extracted from the milk of coconuts, coconut oil has been used overtime not just as a cooking oil but also as a skin moisturiser. It is high in saturated fats with antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Use virgin unprocessed coconut oil as the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties in the oil breaks up bacteria. Apply as a moisturiser on either your skin or scalp by applying all over the body or only focusing on the itchy area. For people allergic to coconut, test first on a spot in the inner arm if after 24 hours there is no reaction, then continue with it. If irritation develops, make sure to discontinue immediately. Tea Tree Oil The Melaleuca alternifoila (Tea Tree) is an Australian plant used as an antiseptic and anti-inflammatory oil by the Aboriginal people. The tea tree oil is an essential oil steam-distilled from the plant. By working against bacterial, viral and protozoal skin infections, the terpenes in the tea tree oil break up the bacteria cellular matter. Before using directly on the skin, make sure to dilute the tea tree oil by mixing a few drops with coconut oil, olive oil or your cream. Use on the affected area after a bath. For other itchy areas such as the scalp or foot, you could consider purchasing commercial products such as shampoos and foot creams with tea tree oil.
