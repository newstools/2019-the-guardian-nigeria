The clubâ€™s former Germany midfielder Ozil can be seen in his black Mercedes sports utility vehicle before he reportedly took refuge in a Turkish restaurant. Judge Sheelagh Canavan ordered Smith be held in custody until he is sentenced at the same court on November 1. Jordan Northover, 26, has also been charged over the incident and is due to appear before magistrates on Friday. The two players missed the start of the English Premier League season following the attempted robbery, amid concerns about their security, but have since returned to playing for Arsenal.
