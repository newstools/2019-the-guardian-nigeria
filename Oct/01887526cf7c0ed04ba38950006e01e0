 Adele parties at Drake’s birthday party with a hot new look. The pop star had been taking up fitness classes alongside her good friend Ayda Field.    The two kept their relationship mostly out of the spotlight since starting to date back in the summer of 2011. She gave birth to their son, Angelo, in October 2012. They tied the knot in a very secret ceremony, and she didn’t confirm the union until 2017.  Adele attended a Drake show last year and raved about it. Drake replied, mentioning if he knew Adele was in the crowd, he would have been “SHOOK.”
