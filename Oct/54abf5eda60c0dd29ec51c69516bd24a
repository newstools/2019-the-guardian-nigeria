Accordingly, investors lost N103 billion in value as market capitalisation declined to N12.948 trillion. The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which were; Nestle Nigeria, Dangote Cement, Guinness Nigeria, Nigerian Breweries, and Presco.The Chief Operating Officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion, said: “The market continued on a down trend as its benchmark All-Share index extended its seventh trading session of back-to-back losses on negative sentiments and selloffs, as revealed by trade patterns and Investdata’s sentiment report. However, the loss momentum was seemingly slower in pace.”
 
But he expects the mixed trend and patterns to reduce selloffs, as bargain hunters take advantage of the pull-back to position ahead of quarterly scorecards, especially now that the NSE-ASI recently tested a new low and rebounded same day, a good sign of imminent reversal if supported by positive sentiments, while the interplay of market forces determine direction.
