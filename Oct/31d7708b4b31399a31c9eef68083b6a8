Some hoodlums at Mile 2 area of Lagos State yesterday attacked a petrol-laden tanker as it passed through the area, causing it to spill its content. The hoodlums had waylaid the truck driver to extort money (Owo boys) from the driver. When the driver hesitated, the boys hit the tanker with an iron, causing it to spill its content. Following this incident, residents and passersby began to scoop petrol gushing out from the 33,000-litre tanker despite the danger of such action. The incident caused panic in the area with many nursing the fear of a fire outbreak in the event of an explosion. Many people gathered round the scene of the incident and on the bridge overhead the spot to watch and record as the boys kept vandalizing the tanker to scoop fuel. Some of the videos of the incident immediately went viral on social media. However, in a swift response to a distress call, men of the Lagos State Fire Service, State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), and Rapid Response Squad (RRS), raced to the scene and restored sanity to the area while preventing possible fire explosion. While the operation lasted, the lane was cordoned off but the traffic flow was later restored after LASEMA recovered the tanker from the road and towed it to a safe location.
