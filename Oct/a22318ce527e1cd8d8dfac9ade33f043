The former chairman of the Pension Reform Task Team (PRTT), Abdulrasheed Maina and his son, Faisal, will today be arraigned by the Nigeria’s anti-fraud office. Maina will be arraigned for alleged fraud by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission while his son, a final year Telecommunications Engineering student in a Dubai University, is still unknown. “Also to be arraigned on the same day, in the same court on a separate but similar charge is his son, Faisal,” the EFCC spokesman Wilson Uwujaren said in a statement on Tuesday. Uwujaren said Maina will be arraigned on a 12-count charge bordering on “money laundering, operating fictitious bank accounts and fraud.” He said the former pension task team chairman would be taken before Okon Abang, a judge of a federal high court in Abuja. The development is coming after Folashade Ogunbanjo, a judge, ordered the forfeiture of 23 properties linked to Maina. Justics Ogunbanjo, gave the order while ruling on a motion filed by the EFCC. The temporarily forfeited properties are situated in Kaduna, Borno, and Sokoto, as well as the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).
