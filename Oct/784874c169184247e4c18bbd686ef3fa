Labour Leader and member National Executive Council (NEC) of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Issa Aremu has condemned the deplorable state of the nation’s education system, calling for quick intervention to rescue it from total collapse. Aremu said government should be concerned about the comatose state of education and the poor welfare of teachers at all levels, since they are the drivers of the nation’s development and growth. In a statement to commemorate this year’s Teachers’ Day celebration, Aremu said: “Federal and state governments must massively recruit, motivate and train more teachers for Nigeria to be able to meet the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. “Education is key to all the 17 development goals to which Nigeria subscribes. But there can only be good education with good quality teachers. With less than 3 million teachers in public schools, teachers per pupil are still low in Nigeria.
