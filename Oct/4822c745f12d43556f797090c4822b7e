Atiku, the ex-vice-president of Nigeria and presidential candidate for the last presidential election in Nigeria, has lost his appeal case in court as the court dismissed his case. The Ex-vice president challenged the presidential election tribunal judgement which affirmed the victory of President Muhammadu Buhari’s victory at the February 2019 poll. However, today, Nigeria’s Supreme Court dismissed Peoples Democratic Party’s presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar’s appeal for lacking merit. This news has made the Nigerian social media go agog and below are reactions: Atiku’s lawyers are the ultimate winners.   #AtikuIsGone — J. (@Johannxs) October 30, 2019  Atiku is NOT coming. The Supreme Court has dismissed all suits and reaffirmed President Buhari as the winner. Did it surprise you? — the Morris Monye factor (@Morris_Monye) October 30, 2019  Atiku was never gonna win…he knew this from day zero. He was buying time and also using our commonwealth to try to wipe his severely battered image. Nigerians no dey carry last…they used the opportunity to retrieve part of their commonwealth. Las las everyone would be fine. — Ediong (@Ediong) October 30, 2019  Supreme Court dismissed Atiku's petition for lack of merit. #AtikuIsNotComing.
