Owena Queens have been poor at the on-going Prudent Energy Handball League because most of their star players are injured, while some of the new players have not come to terms with a competition as big as the league, the team’s star player, Mary Olawuyi has revealed. Olawuyi, who disclosed that her team had only seven players available for picks, revealed that three members of the squad were injured, while one other was sick. Olawuyi, one of the experienced players called out from retirement to help the Owena girls, said the limited number of players in their camp has hampered the team’s attempt to compete well with the rest, hence the unfavourable results the team has been churning out since the start of the competition. “Four players are injured, we have no bench and we have been playing with seven players since four days ago. But we have continued to give our best,” she added. Niger United, Sokoto Rima, Abia Valiants, Safety Babes, Defender Babes, and Seasider Babes won yesterday in the men and women’s categories of the league holding at the Mobolaji Johnson Sports Complex, Rowe Park, Yaba, Lagos State. In the men’s category, Prison Key Boys lost 34-38 to league leaders, Niger United, who maintained their leadership position on the table, while Sokoto Rima subdued Owena Kings 35-30. The women’s class saw Abia Valiants beating Owena Queens 28-27, while Edo Dynamos lost 24-27 to Safety Babes. Defender Babes overcame Desert Queens 33-25 as Kada Queens were humbled 25-27 to Seasider Babes. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
