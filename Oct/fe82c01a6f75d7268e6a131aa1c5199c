With the recent xenophobic attacks and hate speeches among young people, educationist has said that proper education is key to addressing the wide range of global issues.
 
Deputy Director of Education, Greensprings School, Dr. Barney Wilson, who stated this recently, remarked that education providers should endeavour to educate the next generation of world leaders to have a better outlook, respect for each other citing that “our differences make us unique, it should not bring division.”
 
Wilson, at a programme to mark the Independence Day, harped on the need to enlighten the students, parents and the learning community on xenophobia and its consequences.
 
“Our theme for the year is ‘Xenophobia: A cry for unity and one Africa,’ the students demonstrated their knowledge on what xenophobia is and the fact that it is something that is not good for Africa.” The deputy director said xenophobia is not just an African problem but also a global problem. Wilson said that some of the causes are the deep-seated racism, hatred, and lack of education.He said that mindset plays a great role because when we do not know people, the culture, we tend to have in our minds many things about them and many times what we thinking are not just right.
