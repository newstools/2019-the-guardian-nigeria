Former 6ix9ine Associate Jamel ‘Mel Murda’ Jones Sentenced to 135 Months | Complex/Getty/Jerritt Clark In the highly publicized trial of embattled American rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine, one of his former associate Jamel ‘Mel Murda’ Jones has been sentenced to 135 months in Federal penitentiary. Judge Paul Engelmayer decided the heavy sentence Thursday morning after finding Jones guilty of racketeering and narcotic distribution. 6ix9ine had testified against fellow Nine Trey gang members, Aljermiah “Nuke” Mack and Anthony “Harv” Ellison. However, Jones who is regarded as the “godfather” of the gang was involved after his name came up a number of times during the the proceeding. Judge Paul Engelmayer interpreted a wiretapped phone conversation between him (Jamel Jones) and rapper Jim Jones, in which Jamel Jones said 6ix9ine should be “super violated”, as a threat to 6ix9ine’s life. Jones had earlier in the month pleaded for leniency in a letter addressed to Engelmayer, in which he explained his early gang involvement: “I took to the streets heavy at the age of fourteen… I wanted to fall back from the gang life and do the right thing by my family, but I felt like I was somehow being wrong to my gang family, because at that point, I really believed they had been there for me when I had no one.” Meanwhile, 6ix9ine will be sentenced on 18th of December.
