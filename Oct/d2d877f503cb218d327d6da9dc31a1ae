Organisation of Ebonyi State Indigenes in the Diaspora (OESID) yesterday faulted the decision of Governor Dave Umahi to allow the establishment of Rural Grazing Area (RUGA) in the state. The spokesperson, Pascal Oluchukwu, in a statement argued that the governor took the decision without recourse to the people, where the sovereignty resides. It urged Umahi to immediately rescind the decision in the interest of the people, just as it accused him of muzzling opposing voices in the state to satisfy his political interests. “Enough is enough. We, the peace-loving people of Ebonyi State, will not allow Governor Umahi to mortgage our future in his blind support of the Federal Government’s abhorrent agenda, while pursuing his personal ambition after his tenure ends in 2023.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
