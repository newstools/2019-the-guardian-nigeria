The Nigerian army has refuted claims that it has deployed troops across the states of the federation to begin ‘Operation Positive Identification’ (OPI) exercise. A number of Nigerian organisations issued travel advisories to their staff concerning the military operation. A company identified as Bricks told its staff “that residents should move around with valid means of identification, and obey all directives by security agents,” as the army was about to launch a nationwide “Operation Positive Identification” The operation, according to the statement, will start from November 1, 2019, and lasts until December 23, 2019. The army said the information contained in the travel advisory was “fake”. But, the army in September announced a similar operation in some states in the country’s northeast. “The operation is aimed at searching for and arresting all suspected erstwhile Boko Haram/ISWAP criminal elements that roam some parts of the North Eastern part of the country,” the army said. “Consequently, members of the public are enjoined to always carry valid means of identification when moving or passing through the states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe,” the force added. A few days later after the launch of OPI, the army said it was going to extend the operation across the country “to checkmate bandits, kidnappers, armed robbers, ethnic militia, cattle rustlers as well as other sundry crimes.” “The NA, once again, use this opportunity to enjoin all Nigerians not to panic on seeing an increased presence of military personnel and other security agencies as well as movement of Military vehicles /hardwares,” army said in a tweet. The army, however, did not state whether or not residents would be asked to show means of identification. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
