The convener of Speaking Fingers, Mrs. Treasure Uchegbu, who made the call in Lagos, said last month was dedicated to the deaf society. “At the United Nations General Assembly, there were over 200 sign languages experts to cater to the deaf community participating at the world summit. This is in line with their goals of not leaving any segment of the society behind in the attainment of its SDGs. “In like manner, members of the public should emulate the few religious centres and special schools that take the extra effort to ensure the deaf community are carried along. Even our television stations should make this a regular staple of their news bulletin,” she said. The sign language advocate maintained that rather than the hearing impairment persons live a life of survival, struggles and exclusion, they should be given equal participation to issues around them in order to enable them add their value to the nation’s development. Uchegbu also recommended that government and telecommunications firms should provide platforms and facilities for the hearing Impairment persons to socialize, interact and gain knowledge to harness the power that lies within them as special persons for global impact, while government should strengthen the existing special units in schools and create more centres in top universities in each geo-political zones of the country for a wider reach.
