Son of the late industrialist, Kehinde Sanusi, has accused his sister, Ms. Bilikisu Odetola Sanusi of using the police to harass him and his brother, Sule Sanusi, in a bid to frustrate them from pursuing the enforcement of fundamental human rights case coming up later this month at a Lagos high court. Kehinde is one of the sons of the famed iron and steel merchant, the late Alhaji Abdul-Rasak Sanusi, who died on August 1, 1997, leaving behind a will, which has generated disputes and divisions among family members over the estate of the deceased. Kehinde had filed a fundamental human rights case against the police, Abimbola Sanusi, Bilikisu Otedola Sanusi and others. He alleged that on September 30, Bilikisu, who is a Deputy Director in the Lagos State Ministry of Justice, armed with police officers, was seen at the office he shared with Sule, harassing and intimidating their security staff. He said a security officer was taken away with instruction that the two Sanusi brothers present themselves at the police station to answer a petition against them. “Even though there are many court orders against her person. By order of court Suit No.ID/1668/2008, Ms. Bilikisu had been ordered to stay away from the subject property until the determination of several law suits filed against her and others,” he alleged. Reacting to the accusation, Bilkisu said there was no way she could harass or intimidate Kehinde, as he was the one doing the harassment, adding that she did not know of any case coming up later this month. “You can publish what you like because there are so many cases in court that is in the name of Sanusi and I don’t know whether himself is part of the case, it is his senior brother, Sulaiman that has taken most of the cases to court. They have many cases on their mother’s side, which they have taken to court against the rest of us,” she said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
