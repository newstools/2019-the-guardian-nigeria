National Population Commission (NPC) is unhappy with the rate children die in Imo State, where an average of 132 deaths reportedly occur per 1,000 births. The commissioner in charge of Imo, Prof. Uba Nnabue, told newsmen in Owerri yesterday that there was urgent need to curb the menace in the state. Apart from known diseases such as pneumonia and meningitis, NPC disclosed that beliefs, ignorance, poverty and cultural practices also contribute to the deaths. According to Nnabue, the commission has started the 2019 Verbal and Social Autopsy (VASA) survey in the state to obtain data that would help in determining the contributory factors to deaths of under-five children.
