Nigeria Police Force and the proscribed Islamic Movement of Nigeria protesters Friday again clashed in Abuja. The police are dispersing the Shi’ite group who had trooped out to protest against the continued detention of its leader Ibrahim El-Zakzaky. The protesters are with two flags, one red and the another black, with the chant: “Labaika yah Hussein. Free Zakzaky”, loosely translated as “Welcome you Hussein. Free Zakzaky”. Hussein is seen by the Shi’ites as their first imam. As the protesters marched, a team of police officers followed behind, shooting in the air and firing tear gas.
