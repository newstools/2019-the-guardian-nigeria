The driver, who drove against traffic on the expressway, fled the scene as soon as the accident occurred, along with his conductor. Driver of the damaged bus, Mr. Tony Maxwell, who was in shock over the incident, said: “I have been driving for almost 20 years, I have never experienced a thing like this. The bus taking one-way was coming at me on top speed. As hard as I tried to avoid a collision, it was to no avail. I don’t know what was chasing him. I tried to dodge him, yet he still drove into my vehicle. I thought I was dead, I never believed I could survive it. I thank god for His mercies.” Maxwell said he would have died in the accident if not for his quick reaction. One of the passengers in the bus, who sustained an injury on his leg, told The Guardian that the two passengers seated in front with the driver were badly injured and have been rushed to the hospital. Mr. Sunday Christian, Maxwell’s bus conductor, blamed the accident on the reckless driving of the other bus driver. According to him, “the other Danfo was on high speed. My boss had noticed it and was trying to avoid the bus but what he was running from still happened.”Eyewitnesses urged the government to prevail on the contractor working on the expressway to hasten the ongoing road rehabilitation, which is making commercial buses defy traffic rules and ply one-way. One of the victims, a lady, had her bag stolen at the scene of the accident.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
