• SIEC To Use Civil Servants As Ad-Hoc Staff Ekiti State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Asuquo Amba, has warned the political class against thuggery and vote buying, as such acts are capable of truncating smooth conduct of the December 7,  2019 Local Council Election. Amba warned politicians to desist from unwholesome practices, while assuring voters and political parties that his men would provide a level playing ground for all contestants. The Commissioner gave the advice on Friday during a stakeholders’ meeting organised by the Ekiti  State Independent Electoral Commission (SIEC). The meeting was attended by political parties’ representatives, security agencies and electoral officers from various local councils in the state. While reiterating the command’s readiness to work with other sister agencies, including members of the Oodua People’s Congress(OPC), Amba said the move would further ensure smooth conduct of the exercise. The Commission’s Chairman, Justice Jide Aladejana,  solicited support of the political parties and other stakeholders. He ruled out the use of National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members during the exercise and disclosed that teachers and other government workers would be used as ad-hoc staff.
