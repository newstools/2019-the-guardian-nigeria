The management of the Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC) has warned its customers against making cash payments during the ongoing Metre Asset Provider (MAP) scheme. The Executive Director, Commercial, Mr. Abu Ejoor, speaking at the launch of the Ondo State MAP scheme in Akure, said none of the customers across the four states of coverage of the electricity company should pay cash to anybody. “Once a customer’s premises is cleared, such customer would be advised on how to pay for the meter, whether single-phase or three-phase, the price of which is N38, 350 and N70, 350 respectively,” he said. He listed requirements for the installation to include passport photograph, a utility bill for postpaid customers and vending slip for prepaid customers, telephone numbers and email addresses. He disclosed that about 114, 740 meters would be rolled out within the next two years in Ondo State, with a monthly average of 5,000 meters at peak level, after the initial take-off and build-up period. This, he said, would bridge the metering gap in line with Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission’s (NERC) regulations to eliminate estimated billing, encourage the development of independent and competitive meter services and enhance revenue assurance, among others.
