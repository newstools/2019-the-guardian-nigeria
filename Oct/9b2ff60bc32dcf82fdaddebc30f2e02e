 [FILES] Chairman of the forum and Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi  Chairman of PDP in the state, Chief Gboyega Oguntuase, who wondered that there was no activity in the state to commemorate the 23rd creation anniversary of the state and the nation’s 59th Independence anniversary, said: “It is as if governance is under suspension in Ekiti State because the governor is hardly visible within the state. The governor is never around.” The PDP chairman, who spoke in Ado-Ekiti yesterday, alleged that the governor had not been around to attend to governance issues and the challenges of insecurity, including herders crisis, armed robbery incidences, and kidnappings. But the APC State Publicity Secretary, Ade Ajayi, who said the PDP allegations were “baseless, irresponsible and frivolous,” advised Ekiti people to ignore the opposition party, saying: “PDP should bury its head in shame for destroying Ekiti. “Everybody, who has eyes will see what Fayemi has been able to do within one year in office. But if PDP is saying nothing has been done, it means PDP members are blind.” Ajayi, who said Fayemi was discharging his duties as Chairman of Nigeria Governor’s Forum (NGF) as well his responsibilities as Ekiti governor, queried: “Is the governor not responding to the yearnings and aspirations of Ekiti State by paying workers’ salaries regularly and paying the pensioners regularly? “Is he not performing his responsibilities by undertaking the repair of water projects abandoned by PDP while they were in office?” he said. Water project is going on, the civic centre abandoned by PDP is almost completed and a lot of other projects like that,” he said. He, however, advised that PDP should find a way of sitting down and seeing how they would co-operate with Fayemi’s government in moving Ekiti forward rather than portraying it negatively by playing politics to the gallery.
