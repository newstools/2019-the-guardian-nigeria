French League 1 side OGC Nice has sacked forward Lamine Diaby-Fadiga after he admitted to stealing a watch owned by new signing Kasper Dolberg. “OGC Nice and Lamine Diaby-Fadiga parted ways on Tuesday,” the French League 1 side said in a statement. “Following the theft of Kasper Dolberg’s watch from the professional first team’s changing room, and the subsequent admission of the player, the club decided to cancel its contract with the 18-year-old forward with immediate effect.” Diaby-Fadiga, a promising France Under-18 international, has made seven appearances for Nice for a combined 183 minutes without a goal, he now finds himself clubless. Last week, reports surfaced that Kasper Dolberg reported the loss of his watch to the police on September 16. The watch is valued at  €70,000. Diaby-Fadigal afterwards admitted committing the theft and offered to reimburse Dolberg, who joined OGC Nice from Ajax in the summer, for the full value of the watch. He has also apologised to Dolberg and manager Patrick Vieira. But OGC Nice said it “cannot and will not accept such behaviour that betrays the confidence that unites all the club’s employees and all the members of the Rouge et Noir family.” The drama has not affected Dolberg’s performance for his new club. He has scored two goals in four Ligue 1 appearances this season.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
