Vector raised a number of issues in “Judas The Rat”: Jesse Jagz: This is the biggest blow in the “Judas The Rat”. Vector raises questions about Jesse Jagz shocking exit from Chocolate City in 2012: “Jesse Jagz you’re my buddy but I couldn’t do this in a hurry, but the truth about your brother has been blurry.” “You called yourself a teacher but your students failed in real life. Your brother was such a gift but you rapped away from the light.” “You claimed helping people who are struggling to make it, hmm, well Jesse is struggling to make it” “The last I checked Jesse was in a Choc Boy mansion, but since your big brother evicting him is part of the game” Supporting up-and-coming rappers: Vector raises doubt about M.I’s claim of supporting a number of rappers in the industry. “Who are the rappers that I put on? Many more plus two out of your three. And I didn’t sign anything, I did it all for free.” Vector had previously worked with AQ and Blaqbonez. Vector featured AQ, Terry Tha Rapman and X.O. Senavoe on the 2011 song, “Ginja”. In 2012, Vector and AQ collaborated on “Distractions” a diss track aimed at Reminisce. Blaqbonez emerged the 1st runner-up in Vector’s king kong competition and also became the Hennessy Vs class captain. “Your father raised you in the way of the Lord but we never see you acting in the way of the Lord. Is it the Lord’s way to only act when you make gain? How many rappers have you supported without making any gain?” “I know the day would come when everyone you lifted would speak. People would know you lifted them to step on them to your peak.” Listen to “Judas The Rat”:
