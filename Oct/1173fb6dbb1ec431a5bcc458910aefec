Many people may not be aware of it but former NBA star Lamar Odom and Hollywood actress, Taraji P. Henson were an item back in the days. Odom in a new interview for the TV One series, “Uncensored,” has opened up about his breakup from the ‘Acrimony’ star, admitting that he was an “immature punk” when he broke up with her. The former lovebirds dated on the low in 2009 thanks to former Hollywood’s favourite couple, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt who helped them get together. In the interview, Odom says he was heads over heels in love with Henson at first but had no idea how to tell her he was falling for another woman, reality TV star, Khloe Kardashian.

Odom said: “She was a little older than me but I learned a lot from her because that was the most significant relationship as a grown up that I had with a black woman. I used to carry her picture on the road with me. She gave me inspiration.” However, the romance went downhill when he met Kardashian whom he says he felt it was love at first sight with KK (they married just 1 month after meeting). On how things ended with Henson, he said: “Things ended with Taraji because of me being an immature punk. I didn’t know how to tell her I was falling in love with another woman named Khloe Kardashian.” Odom and Khloe’s marriage later crashed in 2013 although their divorce wasn’t finalised until 2016. He has never hidden the fact that he still has feeling for Khloe although she moved on to Tristan Thompson and is currently in a complicated baby daddy situation. As for Henson, she is now engaged to former NFL cornerback Kelvin Hayden.
