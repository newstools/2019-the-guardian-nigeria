Enyimba of Aba, who were relegated to the less fancied CAF Confederation Cup after failing to beat Al Hilal of Sudan in the Champions League, have been drawn against South Africa’s TS Galaxy in the last qualifying round of the competition. Their compatriots, Enugu Rangers will face Togo’s ASCK in the same round of the competition. In the draws conducted by Nigeria’s Samson Adamu in Cairo, Egypt yesterday, Enyimba will meet the South African National First Division side, which sensationally beat Kaiser Chiefs in the 2019 Nedbank Cup final. Although they are debutants in the continent, TS Galaxy are seen as a dangerous side, which can upset Enyimba if the Peoples Elephant by any means underrate them. Rangers’ task against ASCK, who won the 2018/2019 Togolese league, is simple. The Flying Antelopes must be at their best to survive the tie.ASCK, who last featured in a CAF competition in 2008 in the Champions League, supplied some of the players who helped Togo’s national team to two victories recently over Nigeria’s home-based national team. Therefore, they must have something going for them. According to the draws, Enyimba will be at home to TS Galaxy in the first leg, while Rangers will play away to ASCK. The first legs will hold in the weekend of October 27, while the reverse fixtures come up a week later.The winners over two legs will progress to the group stage of the competition.
