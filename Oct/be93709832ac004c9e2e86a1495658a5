 [FILES] Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE)  Precisely, at the close of trading Tuesday, the ASI shed 56.49 absolute points, representing a decline of 0.21 per cent to close at 26,809.92 points. Similarly, the market capitalisation lost N27 billion, to close at N13.051 trillion. The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which were; MTN Nigeria, Guinness Nigeria, Dangote Sugar Refinery, Dangote Flour Mills, and Champion Breweries. On the market performance, the Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion, said equities transactions have continued on a weaker note owing to the lack of a positive stimulus needed to drive demand for stocks, as the composite ASI continued on a down trend, defying the seeming resistance and rebound signals given before now. According to him, this was occasioned by seeming confusion, resulting in sell-down by some fund managers tired of waiting in the continued loss position for a prolonged period, as fiscal and monetary policy authorities become unclear a few days into the last quarter of the year 2019. “The current trend or patterns seem to portend the possibility that stocks will oscillate in the days to come, but not without worries among players before the earnings season kicks off properly at the mid-month.” Market breadth closed negative, with 12 gainers versus 14 losers.
