About three weeks after he released a Spanish language album, African-American singer and record producer Akon has released another album, Akonda. This time, the LP is a nod to his African ancestry, with the album being Afrobeats-influenced. Akongoes full-0n African on Akonda and deliberately tilt the composition of the album towards the Nigerian market and audience by featuring three Nigerian artists – Olamide, Kizz Daniel and Skales. On the track ‘Bottom’ which sounds more like a song done by Olamide, Akon does not only sing in Nigerian pidgin, he also speaks Yoruba. “Ki lele yi? Ibadi leleyi. Ikebe leleyi.Eru l’opo to yi,” Akon sings on the track, obviously targeted at milking the growing acceptance of Afrobeats in Europe and America. Producer Young John, who has collaborated on a few hits with Olamide, also produced at least a track on the album. Same also goes for Samklef, a former Wizkid collaborator. Akonda is the second of the three albums Akon said he will be released in October – El Negreeto being the first and Konnekt is expected to complete the list. All the albums are released on his Akonik Label Group. The label group is comprised of four record labels, Akonda (Afrobeats), Akonik (U.S.), Ke Lo Ke (Latin music) and Jamakon (Caribbean) that will be signing and promoting emerging artists from different regions in the world. Akonda was released on Akonda.
