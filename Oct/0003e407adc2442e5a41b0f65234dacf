The Fulani Socio-cultural organisation, Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, has apologised to Governor Samuel Ortom over herdsmen attacks and killings in the state. National Secretary of the association, Engr. Saleh Alhassan, who spoke, yesterday, in Makurdi during a peace initiative brokered by the Chairman of Air Peace, Chief Allen Onyeama, expressed the herder group’s regrets over the Benue killings and pledged to ensure peaceful coexistence between herdsmen and farmers moving forward. He described Governor Ortom as a peace-loving man, who stood firmly for his people’s emancipation. The Miyetti Allah scribe gave assurance that members of the group would embrace the peace initiatives put forward by the Governor. Responding, Governor Ortom stated that the enactment of the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law by Benue State Government was to end the killing of innocent people and encourage ranching as the global best practice of animal husbandry. He stated that any person or ethnic group wishing to rear livestock in the state was free to come, acquire land and ranch according to provisions of the state’s ranching law. The Governor noted that the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law protects both farmers and livestock owners, adding that legislation was not meant to promote crisis of any kind. Chief Onyema had earlier emphasised the need for peaceful coexistence between farmers and herders in Benue, saying he personally brought Alhaji Saleh to broker peace between Miyetti Allah group and the people of the state.
