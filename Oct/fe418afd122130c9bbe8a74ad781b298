M.I Abaga Announces “No Snake” Tour And Merch In the wake of the spine crushing blows that Nigerian rapper M.I Abaga dealt to his arch-rival, Vector Tha Viper in the diss track “The Viper“, the “Undisputed Champion” rapper is already cashing in on his victory. M.I today took to his social media pages to announce his upcoming tour tagged “No Snakes Tour”:  The tour is scheduled to take M.I across the North America cities of Toronto, Winnipeg, Edmonton, Montreal, Vancouver, New York, DC, Boston, Atlanta, Dallas and Houston. In the same vein, the rapper also announced the availability of the “No Snakes” Tshirt he wore to the Big Brother Naija Finale. This is coming after M.I’s performance at the reality show finale was arguably the biggest highlight of the night as it marked the crescendo in the long-standing beef with Vector. On the stage, M.I performed three of his biggest hits “Undisputed”, “Anoti” and “Bad Belle” to solidify his claim as Africa’s number one rapper. The highpoint of that performance was when M.I sang “Bad Belle” as he and a group of dancers stepped on an animated snake.
