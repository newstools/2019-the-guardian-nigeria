PHOTO: Jasmin Frank/USA TODAY Sports Nigeria’s Israel Adesanya knocked out Australian Robert Whittaker in the second round of the UFC 243 on Sunday morning to become the undisputed middleweight champion of the world. The victory at Marvel Stadium in Melbourne, Australia, capped The Last Stylebender’s remarkable journey in the mixed martial arts. The Nigerian-born fighter needed less than two years and seven fights to clinch the middleweight title. “I eat it and I give it back two times,” Adesanya said after knocking out Whittaker. “That’s a two-piece right there.” With his parents sitting outside the Octagon, Adesanya’s domination of Whittaker, who was the UFC middleweight champion before the fight, was outstanding enough to earn him the Performance of the Night which comes with a $50, 000 prize money. Adesanya has now extended his winning streak to 18 straight wins. The former kickboxing star came into the UFC with 11-0 straight wins. He won the interim middleweight title in Atlanta in April in his sixth UFC fight, dismantling Kelvin Gastelum at UFC 236. His seventh successive victory landed him the undisputed middleweight champion title in front of 57,127 fans, a record crowd for a UFC fight.
