The Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), has disclosed plans to install Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) station, and Very High Frequency (VHF) radio systems at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu.
  
The Guardian learned that the installation, beginning this week, was part of the measures to end blind spots in the eastern corridor of the Nigerian airspace.
  
Some pilots had recently complained that they “fly blind and deaf” in some parts of the airspace with no communication whatsoever. For instance, when it rains in Lagos, they often lose radio communications after 200 nautical miles away, which is dangerous to safe operations.
