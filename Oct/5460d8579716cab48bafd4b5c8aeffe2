Billy Porter is ready to “Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo” his way onto granting a princess’ wish. The 50-year-old Emmy-winning Pose actor, confirmed on Saturday during a panel at the 20th New Yorker Festival that he will play the Fairy Godmother in Sony’s upcoming live-action Cinderella movie. Recall sometime in April, PEOPLE confirmed that Camila Cabello would play the titular princess in the re-imagining of the classic story, helmed by Blockers director and Pitch Perfect writer Kay Cannon and based on an idea from James Corden.

Though plot details haven’t been released, the story is reportedly a modern re-imagining of the classic fairytale in which an orphaned girl becomes a princess. Cabello’s Cuban and Mexican roots will likely play a part in the modern aspect of the story, and The Hollywood Reporter said she will also be involved with the film’s music. Porter recently made history when he became the first openly gay black man to be nominated for and win best actor in a drama at the 2019 Emmy Awards, for his portrayal of Pray Tell in FX’s Pose. Aside from his upcoming Fairy Godmother role, Porter has other projects in the works. “I have a movie with Tiffany Haddish, Rose Byrne and Salma Hayek, Like a Boss,” he shared during the panel on Saturday, when he revealed his Cinderella news. “I have a new album coming out next year. I am directing an episode of Pose.”
