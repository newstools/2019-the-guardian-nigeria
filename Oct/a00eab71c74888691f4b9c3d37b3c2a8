In a statement posted on their website, City said: “the French full-back is expected to return to action following the international break”. Mendy made just eight appearances for City in 2017-18 due to knee surgery and a similar problem limited him to 15 last term. The left-back has played four times for the Premier League champions this season. Former Juventus defender Joao Cancelo was selected in Mendy’s position for Wolves’ visit to the Etihad Stadium.
