As part of efforts to ensure Nigeria maintains its polio-free status, the Rotary Club of Ogudu GRA, has immunised over 100 children in Ogudu community of Kosofe local council, Lagos, against polio virus and its paralysis effects. The exercise was held to commemorate the World Polio Day, held every October 24th. President of the club, Vivian Ohiaeri, reaffirmed Rotary’s commitment to ensure polio is completely eradicated from Nigeria, which is the reason for the continuous vaccination of children in communities across the country. “We are trying to create awareness for polio. Rotary International has been at the forefront of eradicating polio in Nigeria and rest of the world. Today, we have zero polio record in Nigeria. It is three years now without a case recorded in the country. We plan to immunise as many children as we can against polio and ensure that Nigeria stays polio-free,” she said. Also speaking, chairman of the club’s End Polio committee, Gbemileke Afolabi, said Nigeria has recorded a major milestone in the global effort to rid all polio virus strains and ensure that no child is paralysed due to the effect of the virus.
