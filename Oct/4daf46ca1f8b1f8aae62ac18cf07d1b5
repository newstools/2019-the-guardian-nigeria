   She said: “The government instead must take logical steps to grow the industry, and create a roadmap with practical time-based steps to build the industry in a sustainable way, which would attract foreign investors both local and foreign. This is not just for the dairy sector, but for all areas Nigeria wants to see growth.”
  
She noted that industries do not spring up overnight, urging the federal government to keep creating the enabling environment for investments to thrive in its quest to achieve sustainable economic development.She said nations which enjoy FDI inflows provide transparency in business deals, security, infrastructure and intellectual property protection.
  
Earlier, the President, LCCI, Babatunde Ruwase, described the generic theme for the conference, “Promoting investment, connecting businesses” as most appropriate, as the Nigerian economy is in dire need of private investments to move the economy forward.He noted that investments help to create jobs, diversify the economy, grow government revenue, and improve the welfare of the people.
 
According to him, Nigeria’s recovery from recession in the second quarter of 2017, has elicited calls for policies to support sustainable growth and development.He added that steps have been taken and policies put in place to ensure revamping of the Nigerian economy through the promotion of industrialisation and non-oil export for sustainable economic recovery. “However, if the recovery is to be sustained, there must be added drive for domestic and foreign direct investments, promotion of non-oil exports, and continued efforts at improving the ease of doing business in Nigeria,” he said.He noted that it is therefore necessary and critical that the government provides an enabling environment that will encourage investors to invest in the Nigerian economy by addressing the security challenges in the country, and ensuring improved regulatory framework.
  
A Senior Lecturer, Department of Economics and Business Intelligence, Lagos Business School, Pan-African University, Bongo Adi, said although Nigeria has moved up the ladder on the Ease of Doing Business index, growth is not inclusive.He said while Nigeria’s Return on Investment (RoI) remains the highest in Africa, key determinants for FDI like trade, capital inflow and Diaspora remittances need to be addressed.
