Scores of youths from Egbema in Ohaji/Egbema Local Council of Imo State, led by Okenya Thadeaus, yesterday, protested against the alleged destruction of the only access road to their land by the heavy-duty trucks deployed by oil companies operating in their communities. The youths, who blocked the only entrance to the area, accused the companies of meting “inhuman acts to them,” insisting on continuing their protest until the companies undertake corporate social responsibility to the communities. The protesters particularly accused Starling Global Oil Resources of being the major culprit. All efforts to reach the management of the company were unsuccessful, as none of the senior staff could respond to the allegations. But the member representing the constituency in the state House of Assembly, Cyracus Okoro Heclus, who met with the aggrieved youths, urged them to embrace peace and dialogue. He condemned the acts of some few in the communities who allegedly compromised for little gratification but assured of his readiness to assist the people of the area.
