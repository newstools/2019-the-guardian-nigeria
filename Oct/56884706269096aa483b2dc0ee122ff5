This may take a few days,” he added. Johnson insists he does not want to postpone Britain’s departure from the European Union beyond the current October 31 Brexit deadline, and will not “negotiate” with the Brussels to do so. But, after he lost a parliamentary vote earlier Saturday, he is compelled by British law to send a letter to requestion an extension until January 31, 2020, while parliament works on Brexit legislation. The decision will come down to the other 27 EU leaders, but it will be Tusk’s job as head of the European Council to gather their views and he could call a special summit to approve an extension. The letter is due to be sent to his office by midnight on Saturday (2200 GMT).  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
