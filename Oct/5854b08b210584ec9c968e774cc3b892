The additional cost-saving move was to encourage financial discipline and prudence, particularly in the area of official travels. A statement yesterday from the office of the Secretary to Government of the Federation (OSGF) said: “Henceforth, all ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) are required to submit their yearly travel plans for statutory meetings and engagements to the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation and/or the Office of the Head of Civil Service of the Federation for express clearance within the first quarter of the fiscal year before implementation.” Moreover, the president has donated N10 million to launch the 2020 Emblem and Appeal Fund preparatory to the January 15 Armed Forces Remembrance Day celebration. Top government officials and other Nigerians are to don the badge to appreciate the sacrifices of the fallen heroes. Also, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, has warned those using his office for fraudulent acts to stop forthwith or face the full wrath of the law. He gave the warning in a statement yesterday by the Director of Information, Willie Bassey, in Abuja. Mustapha said his attention had been drawn to the “unrelenting activities of faceless persons” in that respect. According to him, “these faceless persons are using the social media and other platforms to lure unsuspecting members of the public to submit their curriculum vitaes (CVs) at a fee, to my office for federal government appointments.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
