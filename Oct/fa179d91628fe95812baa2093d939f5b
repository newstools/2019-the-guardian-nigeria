 Some members of Ikoyi Club staff cooperative society with children of Modupe Cole Home  Chairman of the staff cooperative society of Ikoyi Club 1938, Mr. Taiwo Ariyo, made this known when he led some staff members of the club to Modupe Cole Memorial Child Care and Treatment Home, Yaba, Lagos State to donate some food and gift items as part of activities to mark the 45th anniversary of the cooperative. According to Ariyo, such special kids deserve the society’s attention and care. “As the club is marking its 45th anniversary, we decided to celebrate it differently. Usually, such events are marked wining and dining, but we decided to give back to society by remembering children with disabilities. These children need to be loved and celebrated so that they can believe in themselves. The Modupe Cole Home’s head of children affairs, Mr. Ajani, thanked the cooperative for the gesture, which he said would be a morale booster to the children, as they always feel loved and special when they receive visitors who come around to see and appreciate their works of art. He said the school caters for 457 children with disabilities, of which few of them are day students. The school has also provided vocational training where the children are enrolled in vocational training such as tailoring, barbing, shoe making, furniture among others.
