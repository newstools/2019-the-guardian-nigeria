A few weeks after five young footballers from an Ogun State grassroots team lost their lives in a ghastly motor accident on their way to Ewekoro for a competition, one of the survivors, Adeyemo Olusola, is in urgent need of financial assistance from Nigerians to be on his feet again. Olusola, nicknamed Aseyori, and some other players got injured and were hospitalized after the accident, which occurred on September 6. While other players have since been discharged from the hospital, Olusola was moved from the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) in Abeokuta to the University College Hospital (UCH) Ibadan due to the severity of the spinal cord injury he sustained. The chairman of Ogun State Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN) Hakeem Akintunde, and the secretary, Sanusi Lateef, yesterday appealed for help for the victim, saying that doctors at the UCH in Ibadan are demanding for N1 million for his operation and rehabilitation quickly. “We are appealing to all well meaning Nigerians to donate money for the doctors to save his life. His account details are; Adeyemo Olusola Diamond (Access) Acct no 0107884810,” the statement stated yesterday. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
