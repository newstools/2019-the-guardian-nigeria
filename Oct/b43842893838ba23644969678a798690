So, we discovered that there was cash missing from your wallet,” Megan told Kourtney who had been chatting with sister Khloe about getting rid of her cookie jar collection. “So, I don’t know if you spent it out the other night?” Kourtney admitted to giving the valet $20 but said she remembers having hundreds still left in her wallet. “There’s no hundreds there right now,” Megan confirmed. After Khloe asked if her sister could have somehow misplaced the money, Kourtney replied, “It was definitely there. You know when you just know? Like, I know for a fact.” During a confessional, Kourtney voiced her concerns as this wasn’t the first time something went missing from her belongings. “The fact that money is missing from my wallet definitely doesn’t feel like a coincidence. We had an iPad missing in the house too,” she confessed as a flashback showed her rummaging through her cabinets looking for the device. “You know, I have people in and out of my house all day. People that I trust,” Kourtney stated. “Something just isn’t right.” Her fans are eager to find out if there is a thief amongst Kourtney’s acquaintances and friends.
