“We have a big job at hand, and I have been drumming it into the ears of the players that we cannot afford to fail. The Togolese won 4-1 on their home ground; nothing says we cannot do better on our own home ground.
 
“We have to be focused and determined. We must create chances and put them away because we cannot afford not to be at the African Nations Championship,” said told thenff.com.
 
The winner over two legs between Nigeria and Togo will book a slot at the Sixth African Nations Championship finals scheduled for Cameroon in June 2020.
