Former Super Eagles Goalkeepers’ Trainer, Ike Shorunmu has urged the Golden Eaglets to keep on the fighting spirit that took the team to the second round of the ongoing U-17 World Cup in Brazil. Nigeria came from 1-2 down to beat Ecuador 3-2 in the second group game of the championship on Tuesday evening.Shorunmu, who commended the Eaglets for displaying resilience and commitment in the two games played so far, said the team had what it took to excel in Brazil if the players kept playing as a team. He noted that the skills displayed by the Eaglets in the championship have shown that Nigeria has abundant talents that could make an impact in the senior national team in future.He added, however, that the Golden Eagles still needed to be encouraged to give their best in subsequent games, saying that it would become tougher as teams progressed in the world championship. “The quality of not giving up to the last minute of a game has been guiding the Eaglets in the World Cup. They should forge ahead with their determination to get victory at all cost having qualified for the next round of the championship,” Shorunmu said.He urged the coaches to work on the defenceline to curb the mistakes that have dogged the team in the competition, adding, “The Eaglets coaches are highly experienced and I believe they have what it takes to make the boys better in every game. “One good thing going for the present Eaglets is that the team is always attack minded. That is why they can score two goals within a few minutes in the last two games. This is the hallmark of a good team,” he said.The Eaglets will meet Australia on Friday in their final group game.
