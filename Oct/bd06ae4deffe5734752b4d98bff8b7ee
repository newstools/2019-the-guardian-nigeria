It is no crime if, thanks to your childhood, the first name that comes to mind when you hear “Mr Boombastic” is Shaggy. But, drawing your attention away from dancehall music to hip-hop using the pseudonym is Nigerian rapper, Blaqbonez with his just released EP. Known to be a one-man freight train, it is safe to say the 100 crown’s signee has a never-ending supply of compelling content. Between a number of stellar music releases, and ancillary antics in 2019, the outspoken rapper has become must-see entertainment. Most recently, he showed off his acting chops in his “Therapy Sessions” skits, which are premised on Blaq and his Shaggy-inspired alter-ego, Mr. Boombastic, going to therapy to smooth over disputes. And following from this latest uptick in content, Blaqbonez’s alter-ego releases a new EP eponymously titled, “Mr. Boombastic.” Mr. Boombastic is a seven-track project, sporting overt Reggae influence, which features a deviation from the hardcore rap style usually associated with Blaqbonez. Blaq describes Boombastic as his ‘groovy’ alter-ego, and this is emphasized over the course of the project, with Boombastic’s penchant for up-tempo dance records, as well as his use of patois and fashion sense (see EP cover). The project also features a number of interesting highpoints, including an attention-grabbing intro in “Run My Race”, fan favourite, “Shut Up”, a stellar feature from the infamously reclusive, Black Magic on “Magic”, as well as a superb verse from Falz on title track, “Boombastic”. Tracks like “Promo”, “God When” and “Come 4 U” also help round out what is overall a smooth and versatile project that is appropriate for a myriad of settings. Stream Mr Boombastic below:
