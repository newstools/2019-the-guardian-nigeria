Justice Daniel Longji of Plateau State High Court, handling the case between the Economic and Financial Crimes Commissions (EFCC) and former Governor Jonah David Jang, ruled at the weekend that EFCC’s move to amend earlier charges leveled against Jang was in order, and not in breach of Section 36 (12) of the 1999 Constitution as amended.
 
Longji, therefore, dismissed the averment of the counsel to Jang, Mr. Edward Pwajok (SAN), who was praying the court to quash the move to amend the charges by EFCC.
   
The former Governor is on trial for alleged embezzlement and diversion of about N6.2bn. But on Thursday, Counsel to EFCC, Adebisi Adeniyi, urged the court not to entertain the application by the defence counsel, that court should not allow fresh charges via amendment.
   
EFCC had introduced fresh charges, but Pwajok was asking the court to quash counts 13, 14, 16 and 17 of the amended charges, as they are unknown to court and therefore very incompetent.
   
Pwajok had cited specifically paragraphs 16 and 17 of the amended charges as very prejudicial, preposterous, shocking, embarrassing and outrageous, stressing that the offending words to them in the amended charges are “transferred by approving.”
   
Having listened to all the submissions by the parties, Justice Longji ruled that all previous witnesses be called again, adding however that cross- examination should be limited to the fresh charges only.He adjourned the matter to October 30, 31 and November 1.
