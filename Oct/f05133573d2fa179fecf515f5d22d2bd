Nigeria’s Department of State Services (DSS) has confirmed the arrest of Abdulrasheed Maina former Chairman of the Pension Reform Task Team (PRTT). Maina was arrested in company of his 20-year-old son at the Pennsylvania Avenue Hotel, Utako, Abuja after a request by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to the Service to assist in the apprehension of the suspect. DSS in a statement said Maina’s son Faisal tried to resist the arrest. The secret-security outfit said Faisal “even pulled a pistol against the security agents involved in the operation.” He was, however, disarmed and arrested. Faisal is a final year student at the Canadian University of Dubai where he is studying Telecoms Engineering. Items recovered from Maina and his son include a pistol with live ammunition, a bulletproof Range Rover SUV, a BMW Saloon car, foreign currencies, a Phantom 7 drone and sensitive documents. The suspects and the recovered items will be handed over to the EFCC for further investigations and appropriate necessary actions. The DSS said the operation was as a result of a renewed interagency collaboration among security and law enforcement agencies. The DSS hopes to sustain the initiative in mitigating the current threats against public safety and national critical assets. Maina, a former Chairman of the Pension Reform Task Team, was dismissed from service in 2013 for absconding from duty after the office of the Head of Service had made some recommendations. Maina was at some point a fugitive, having been declared wanted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).
