 Cross River House of Assembly  The Guardian gathered that the assembly did not reconvene yesterday, like their counterparts across the country, after a month recess. Members of the house reportedly refused to reconvene in protest against the non-release of statutory funds by the governor since their inauguration in June. When called for confirmation, the speaker, Eteng Williams, did not respond to voice calls and text messages. But the former chairman of the House Committee on Information, Matthew Olory, said that members were waiting for the speaker to reconvene the house. He, however, confirmed that the house was earlier scheduled to resume last week. “We are waiting for the speaker to reconvene us,” he said. An assembly source, who pleaded anonymity, disclosed that the state government was yet to make official vehicles available to members to help them function effectively. He added that the speaker was even using public transport to move about. Press secretary to the speaker, Mr. Hope Obeten, denied the allegation, saying that most of the lawmakers traveled to Abuja for a conference. His words, “The house was supposed to sit on September 10, but couldn’t because most of the principal officers, including the speaker and deputy speaker, went for a conference in Abuja. “Many of them just came back and are in their various offices. You can come to the assembly and confirm. Their failure to reconvene today has nothing to do with non-payment of allowances or issuance of official vehicles. That information is unfounded and not true.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
