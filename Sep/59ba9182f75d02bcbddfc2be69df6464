Sony And Disney Reunites For New Spiderman Film These are exciting times for fans of Spider-Man as Sony and Disney have reunited for a new Spiderman film. According to Variety, on Friday, the two companies jointly announced that Marvel Studios and its president, Kevin Feige, will produce the third film in the “Spider-Man: Homecoming” series. It will once again feature Tom Holland reprising his role as the titular hero. The rumor mill roared back to life this week with hints that the two companies were close to brokering a new agreement. In August, Disney, Marvel’s parent company, and Sony’s talks over a new financing deal ended in a deadlock. Disney wanted the film to be financed on a 50/50 basis, with Feige remaining in a consulting producer capacity. Sony is believed to have proposed keeping the arrangement under the current terms, which stipulate that Marvel receives about 5% of first-dollar gross and all merchandising revenues. Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said: “I am thrilled that Spidey’s journey in the MCU will continue, and I and all of us at Marvel Studios are very excited that we get to keep working on it. Spider-Man is a powerful icon and hero whose story crosses all ages and audiences around the globe. He also happens to be the only hero with the superpower to cross cinematic universes, so as Sony continues to develop their own Spidey-verse you never know what surprises the future might hold.” Feige played a big creative role in the last two Spider-Man films, and successfully integrated Holland’s character into its multi-billion dollar Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The upcoming film is scheduled for release on July 16, 2021.
