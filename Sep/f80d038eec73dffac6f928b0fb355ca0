 Legal Advisor, Christian Financial Accountability Association, Tomi Vincent (l); Pastor/Leadership Consultant, Dr. Sam Adeyemi and Finance Expert/Economist, Yinka Ogunnubi, at a press conference on Fostering Accountability and Governance among Churches and Christian Faith-based Organisations in Lagos… last week.  Speaking during the maiden media briefing and conference of CFAA, the Senior Pastor of Daystar Christian Centre (DCC), Pastor Sam Adeyemi, said although churches do not owe the government any responsibility in terms of the management of their finances, the formation of the body was a deliberate step to help them improve on their financial management skills. He said: “We must admit that most church leaders don’t have the financial management skills. When we help the churches and other Christian faith-based organisations to structure better, their finances will improve.” Adeyemi, who stressed that Jesus gave many parables, particularly the one about talent, which is about stewardship, said Christians, must obey God’s directives about accountability. A financial expert and economist, Mr. Yinka Ogunubi said the objective of CFAA was to ensure that churches ensure accountability, transparency and good governance.He said: “You cannot say you are championing the cause of Christianity and at same time you are afraid of being accountable. Because the basis of Christianity itself is accountability to God.” He said by complying with these principles, the church or organisations affiliated to CFAA, would become the standard of accountability, transparency and good governance.Ogunnubi said the organisation run by professionals would focus on education and enlightenment on corporate governance and accountability.
