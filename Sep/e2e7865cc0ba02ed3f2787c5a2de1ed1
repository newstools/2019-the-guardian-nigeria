Photo/Twitter/GovIfeanyiOkowa  The Delta State government set up a panel three years ago to look into the protracted land dispute but has been unable to implement the recommendations of the panel, thus creating the impression that the state government was not interested in resolving the dispute. It urged Governor Okowa to resolve the lingering boundary dispute between Ogbe-Ijoh Community in Warri southwest and Aladja Community in Udu Council Area to ensure lasting peace in both communities. Chairman of IYC in Ogbe-Ijoh Warri Kingdom, Okosu Smart, said one of the constitutional responsibilities of the Delta State Governor is to establish peace between warring communities in the state. He said, “It is in this regard, IYC Ogbe-Ijoh Warri Kingdom is appealing to Governor Okowa to resolve the issue now that there is relative peace between the two communities. “We do not want a situation where the government would only intervene when there are clashes between the two communities with consequent casualties. The youths are always the victims once there is an attack in the communities. “The conflict between the two communities had claimed many lives and damaged property worth millions of Naira and we do not want a repeat of such ugly incidents in our communities.” He noted that the people of Ogbe-Ijoh Warri Kingdom stand for peace and are ready to continue their good relationship with their Urhobo neighbours of Aladja, urging Governor Okowa to act swiftly to mediate and create lasting peace between both communities.
