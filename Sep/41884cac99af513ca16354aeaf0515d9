Historians have charged the Federal Government to revive the National Archives of Nigeria, decrying the current state of its branches in Ibadan, Enugu, and Kaduna. They also advocated the re-invigoration of the Ibadan School of History to give vent to continental voices and lead the way on African history and historiography. These were the resolutions of an international conference in memory of the late emeritus professor of history, Jacob Ade-Ajayi, at the Subomi Balogun Conference Centre, University of Ibadan. They were contained in a communiqué signed by Chairman of the ​​​​​Organising Committee, Prof. Babatunde Sofela; Head, Department of History, UI, Prof. Olutayo Adesina; and son of the honouree, Dr. Niyi Ade-Ajayi, on behalf of the J.F. Ade-Ajayi Foundation. ` To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
