Barcelona have yet to win away from home this season and play seventh placed Villarreal at the Camp Nou Tuesday and at 10th placed Getafe at the weekend. “The media being what it is you can plunge into a crisis in three days, and we have the chance to get out of it in three days.” “This is football. We have two matches and I want six points, it’s the only way to calm the situation.” Valverde said his French winger Ousmane Dembele would be returning from injury Tuesday, naming him in his squad after a month on the sidelines. Five time Ballon d’Or winner Lionel Messi, Urugauyan centre-forward Luis Suarez and French World Cup winner Antoine Griezmann are all also available. “Dembele can shake things up,” said Valverde. “We know what he can do, its now up to him to prove it on the pitch.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
