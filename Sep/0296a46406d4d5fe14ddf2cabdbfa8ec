Former Anambra State Governor, Peter Obi yesterday said that Nigeria’s judiciary is one of the best in the world.He said his experience relating with the judiciary as a politician and businessman shows that Nigeria’s judiciary had excelled and protects and preserves the nation’s democracy, irrespective of daunting challenges. Speaking in Enugu during the one year memorial lecture in honour of former chief judge of Enugu state, late Justice Innocent Umezulike, Obi stated that the country’s politics would have been better if a percentage of the judiciary was in the politics of the country. Obi, who was chairman of the event, stated that the problem of the country was that money has taken over values. He said that, despite the notion that justice was no longer possible in Nigeria without money, the nation’s judiciary has continued to live up to expectation. Relating his experiences in traversing the courts to recover his electoral mandate, he said he never spent a Kobo on any judge in Nigeria. Obi poured glowing tributes on Umezulike for his contributions to the judiciary.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
