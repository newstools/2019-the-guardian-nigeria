 Chinedu Ifeleka  According to the statement by the Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the corps, Mrs. Kehinde Bada-Okoli, yesterday, the suspect was arrested on September 6 at Mapowu Street, Ojo area of Lagos. The corps said the suspect, Chinedu started abusing his daughter in 2016 when she was 11 years old. “The incident happened to the daughter twice while she was 11 years old. The daughter said she reported to her mother but no action was taken.” The teenager, according to the NSCDC, said her father sexually abused her again on August 9 while her mother was away at her paternal grandmother’s place. “The young girl said her father woke her up at about 2:25a.m. to start touching her inappropriately after which he had carnal knowledge of her.” NSCDC said the suspect, Chinedu, in his statement admitted committing the crime but, however, insisted that he had carnal knowledge of her daughter only once. “The victim’s mother, Mrs. Florence Ifeleka, in her statement said she was scared to report the incident because her husband threatened to deal with her ruthlessly if she did.” The Lagos State Commandant, Mr. Cyprian Otoibhi, while presenting the suspect to newsmen said, “he will face the full wrath of the law as he would be handed over to the appropriate agency for further investigation and prosecution. This is a heinous crime and all perpetrators of such, when caught will be made to pay dearly for it.” Reiterating the corps mandate of protection of critical infrastructure as well as protection of lives and property, the Commandant said the corps would not rest on its oars in ensuring a crime-free Lagos. “I enjoin the populace to avail the corps and other security agencies with necessary intelligence and information to rid the state of all forms of crimes,” Otoibhi said.
