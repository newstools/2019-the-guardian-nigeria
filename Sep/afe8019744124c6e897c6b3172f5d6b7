Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu has commended the Redeemed Christian Church of Godâ€™s (RCCG) for its contributions to both the health and the educational sectors. Speaking during the commissioning of a 12-classroom block built by RCCG Tabernacle of David and the Resettlement Healthcare Centre, which was refurbished and equipped by the same Parish, under the charity arm of the RCCG, His Love Foundation (HLF), Sanwolu said his administration would cater for the educational need of every child of school age. We will give our children the opportunity to attend quality schools that will not be too far away from them. I have directed to the Commissioner of Education that all school owned by the state government be equipped with well-trained teachers that will help us to deliver quality training to our children in line with development agenda of my administration Kayode Pitan who doubles as the Pastor in charge of RCCG Tabernacle of David and Assistant Pastor in Charge of the Region said the decision to build the school was in response to the lack of any public schools in the area, which made children in the community travel to attend school, exposing them to dangers. Speaking on behalf of the General Overseer of RCCG, the Special Assistant to The G.O on Christian Social Responsibility (CSR), Idowu Iluyomade said these CSR investments stem from their continued resolve to be of service to humanity in general, and their host community.
