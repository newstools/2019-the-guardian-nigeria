The group also organised seminars to educate Nigerians on dangers associated with buying and consuming meat infected with rabies and tuberculosis, and the preventive measures to protect pets from contracting these diseases. The group at a general meat examination at the Central Abattoir, Ibadan, Oyo State, inspected meat that was processed at the abattoir. The Central Abattoir, which is viewed as one of the largest in West Africa, processes about between 1, 000 and 1, 500 animals including, cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs daily. A butcher and chairman of the Sheep and Goat Butchers Association, Oyo branch, Tiliatu Agesin, told The Guardian, however, denied processing pregnant and disease-infested meat, and being part of “such barbaric act.” He said all animals are inspected by the two resident veterinary doctors before that are processed for sale, adding that pregnant animals are not slaughtered at the abbatoir.
