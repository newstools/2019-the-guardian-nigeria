 Most Rev. Nicholas Okoh, Primate of all Nigeria (Anglican Communion)  Speaking at the dedication of the Compass Rose Table Water Factory built by the church in Kuje, a suburb of the Federal Capital Territory, Okoh who condemned the frequent attacks, warned that the attendant public outcry may come with more reactions and many things could go wrong in the process. He said, “We should know that the people who have shops in ShopRite are Nigerians. If we go there and destroy it, we are not helping Nigerians, if we go there and attack MTN, Nigerians are there, so the government should handle it diplomatically so that we don’t behave like South Africans.” Also speaking, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Odein Ajumogobia, observed that Nigerians and South Africans have a long-standing relationship, adding that Nigeria played a major role in South Africa’s liberation. Ajumogobia therefore, asked South Africa to take into consideration, the huge role Nigeria played in ensuring its independence in the way it manages the potentially volatile situation, and also called on the Federal Government to do all it can to contain the situation, and maintain a healthy relationship with the South African government, through dialogue in order to stop this evil.
