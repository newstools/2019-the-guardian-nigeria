Tagged “Pepper Dem”, the show got even spicier after Tacha, Sir Dee, Venita, Frodd, Esther, Cindy were put up for possible eviction. Considering how most of these housemates have a strong fan base, it still left many individual fans tensed. In continuation of the drama not just within the house both outside its four walls, viewers have shockingly been busy picking their rather unexpected favourite housemates as reflected in their votes. Sir Dee and Esther were the unlucky housemates whose votes ranked lowest which led to their eviction from the BBNaija house. Esther who was head of house for a short while had her privileges halted when Khafi took over after winning a game.

However, Sir Dee’s eviction came a little like a shock to viewers who are now realising that Cindy got more votes than him. See reactions to the eviction show below:
