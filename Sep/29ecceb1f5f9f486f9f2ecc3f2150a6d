Big Brother Housemate, Sir Dee | Photo: Twitter Nowadays, Sunday nights are when most Nigerians and Africans gather around their TV screens to see if their favourite Big Brother Naija housemate(s) still has a chance at winning the N60million cash prize. Tagged “Pepper Dem”, the show got even spicier after Tacha, Sir Dee, Venita, Frodd, Esther, Cindy were put up for possible eviction. Considering how most of these housemates have a strong fan base, it still left many individual fans tensed. In continuation of the drama not just within the house both outside its four walls, viewers have shockingly been busy picking their rather unexpected favourite housemates as reflected in their votes. Sir Dee and Esther were the unlucky housemates whose votes ranked lowest which led to their eviction from the BBNaija house. Esther who was head of house for a short while had her privileges halted when Khafi took over after winning a game. Big Brother Housemate, Esther | Photo: Dailypost Judging from recent Twitter polls, Esther seems to be the least liked housemate and some social media users have been anticipating her exit from the house especially because of her relationship with Frodd. However, Sir Dee’s eviction came a little like a shock to viewers who are now realising that Cindy got more votes than him.

He didn't deserve to go yet. Unfortunately, his presence isn't strongly felt by the viewers even though he's a very likeable guy in the house, and this is a game and somebody gotta go. #BBNaijaEviction — Late Bloomer  (@dee_zedd) September 1, 2019  Why sirdee!!!

Sir Dee thank you for loving our girl Tacha, you made that house bearable for her when most didn't want to associate with her. I wish you all the best in your future endeavours. I'm pained, but I guess it's part of the game.#BBNaija — #Tachaholic #BBNaija (@Xolelwa_Gwele) September 1, 2019  Yes! Yes! Yessssssss! Sir Dee is out!!!! Omg!
