The leader of the Nigerian Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) Lagos chapter, Musiliu Akinsanya popularly known as MC Oluomo, is yet again the subject of discussion on social media. Oluomo was invited as a special guest for a seminar organised by the University of Lagos (UNILAG). However, this invitation has led to so many mixed reactions on social media where many expressed not just shock and disappointment but applaud him for “not only being an agbero” but being “more qualified to speak at the event than 95% of our current and past graduates”. A twitter user expressed his disappointment and shock saying: “How can a National Thug be allowed to talk in UNILAG and Sowore wasn’t welcome”. While another stated that “the event was organized by the transport unit of a Dept there..all invitees are stakeholders in the transport sector”, hence the need for his presence. This would not be the first time Oluomo will be in the spotlight. In June, MC Oluomo, his wife and son Ololade received an honorary invitation by the executive governor of Georgia USA, Brain Kemp and his wife, Marty Kemp as a result of his son’s academic excellence. What did Nigerians have to say about this recent development? Plenty. Read some mixed reactions below:
