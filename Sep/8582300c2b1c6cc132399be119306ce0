 NSE’s Building, in Lagos  Specifically, at the close of transactions yesterday, the ASI fell by 69.19 points or 0.3 per cent to 27,283.05 points, as investors lost N34 billion in value with market capitalisation declining to N13.281 trillion. The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, among which were Dangote Cement, Guinness Nigeria, MTN Nigeria, Skyway Aviation Handling Company and Zenith Bank. The Chief Operating Officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion, said the market maintained its volatile pattern as the ASI declined further, extending the negative sentiments for the third consecutive sessions amid continued sell down and profit-taking ahead of quarter-end window dressing by fund managers and the onset of the third-quarter earnings reporting season in October. Also, analysts at Afrinvest Limited argued that the bearish momentum would be sustained in subsequent sessions as investors maintained a risk-off approach towards equities.
