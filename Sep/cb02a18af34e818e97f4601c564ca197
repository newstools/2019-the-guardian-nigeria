A family of six and a relative who came visiting Olowora Street in Oshodi, Lagos State have been reported dead. A man identified as Kasim Sakariyau, an electrician until his death, his four children, pregnant wife and the relative are suspected to be killed by insecticide or what an eyewitness referred to as “fleet poison”. Neighbours had observed that none of the family members had stepped out and the door to their one-room apartment locked, prompting them to forcefully open the door. The deceased were seen with their tongues stuck out with foams in their mouth. The pregnant wife and last born were rushed to the hospital but were later confirmed dead. It was gathered that the family ate jollof rice the previous night and also served some of the neighbours the same. However, the neighbours showed up at the house this morning without any sign of ill-health. When the Guardian visited the house where the tragic death happened, it was observed that the father struggled to escape the room as he was seen at the door. Officials from the ministry of health have evacuated the corpses. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
