The former Chief Judge of Ekiti State and the Oluyin of Iyin Ekiti, Oba Ademola Ajakaye, has joined his ancestors in the early hours of Friday. The late Oluyin, who was the first Chief Judge of the state when it was created in 1986, was at a time the Administrator General, National Judicial Institute (NJI). Governor Kayode Fayemi, who described his death as a huge loss to the state, condoled with the late monarch’s family, the people of Iyin-Ekiti in Irepodun/Ifelodun Local Government and entire citizens of the state. In a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Yinka Oyebode, yesterday, the Governor said the state had lost one of its most cerebral and colourful royal fathers who combined brilliance with admirable traditional flamboyance. Fayemi, who described the late monarch as a successful lawyer and respected bencher, during his stint in the legal profession, said the late Oluyin was ever willing to avail government his wise counsel on issues of development and social justice. Also, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele, in a statement said the town would sorely miss Oba Ajakaye, whom he described as an industrious and charismatic monarch, who brought Iyin to the high pedestal of development. Bamidele said history would continue to remember the monarch for fighting an epochal battle to unite Iyin and ensure that the town remains a potential and relevant force in the political and development efforts of the state. Bamidele said: “Oba Ademola Ajakaye did not only lead Iyin kingdom, he led with panache and finesse. He united the kingdom and ensured that politics and other extraneous issues didn’t create a wedge or stoke the fire of discord in the town.
