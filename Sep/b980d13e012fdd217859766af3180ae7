The petitioner, according to Sani explained that “sometime in February 2019, he opened an account with Diamond Bank (now Access Bank) which he funded to the tune of N5 million and instructed the bank to open a fixed deposit account, with the sum of N1million from the earlier account, as opening balance.” “The complainant said he was receiving regular alerts until the end of March 2019 when the alerts stopped coming, prompting him to demand his statement of account from the bank. “Upon receipt of his bank statement, he discovered to his chagrin that the sum of two million nine hundred and eleven thousand four hundred and eighty naira (N2,911,480 m) had fraudulently been transferred to several accounts between April 5 -9, 2019 without his authorisation.” The EFCC Spokesperson further noted, “Upon the receipt of the petition, the zonal office of the Commission immediately swung into action and traced some of the funds to three of the suspects,  Samuel Okafor Obinna – N1,500.000; Chigbo Paschal Chidiebere -N210,000 and Oha Chukwujekwu Kingsley N300 000.
