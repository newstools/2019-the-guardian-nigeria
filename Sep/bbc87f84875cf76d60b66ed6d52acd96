Media mogul, Oprah Winfrey is taking her motivational spirit on the road early next year with a nationwide arena tour to promote a healthier lifestyle. Winfrey, working in conjunction with Weight Watchers Reimagined to offer a full-day of wellness conversations, announced her “Oprah’s 2020 Vision: Your Life in Focus” tour Wednesday. This will be the philanthropist’s first tour since 2014 and will kick off in the first week of January in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Other stops include Brooklyn, New York, Charlotte, North Carolina, and San Francisco, California. In an official statement, Oprah Winfrey said, “As I travel the country, my hope for this experience is to motivate others to let 2020 be the year of transformation and triumph — beginning first and foremost with what makes us well. This is the year to move forward, let’s make it happen in 2020.”  Winfrey is expected to speak about numerous topics, including interactive workbook exercises and will be joined by celebrity guests in each city. Proceeds from the tour will benefit Weight Watchers Good, a philanthropic area of the organization to help bring fresh and healthy food to underserved communities. To date, Winfrey is the second-largest shareholder in Weight Watchers with an 8 per cent stake in the company, equating to roughly $119 million through Wednesday. She also has a food collaboration deal with Kraft Heinz foods. ‘Oprah’s 2020 Vision: Your Life in Focus’ will wrap up in early March in Denver, Colorado.
