Youth and Sports Minister, Sunday Dare, has disclosed that his current tour of the country’s sports facilities is to ascertain their state and ways to put them in good use. Dare, who disclosed that he would inspect facilities in Lagos State this month, said his administration’s drive is to ensure that Nigerian athletes get the best facilities to train when preparing for future international engagements. Speaking at the Agege Stadium, Lagos on Tuesday, Dare said Team Nigeria’s ‘outstanding performance’ in different events at the just-concluded African Games in Morocco has shown that the nation has the potential to rule the world if standard sports facilities were provided for athletes use. He promised to ensure that Nigerian athletes got the best preparation for the 2020 Japan Olympic Games. “I will be in Lagos to see Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and find out how we can work together to fashion out modalities on how some sports facilities in the state would be revamped. “Nigeria coming second at the African Games is a pointer that more structures need to be put in place to develop sports. The National Stadium, Surulere and other stadia in Ibadan, Oyo State, Abuja, and Kaduna would be given special attention. “The ministry would see how they can work with the private sector to put this stadia in good condition.” Dare also promised to help the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) secure the right to host the U-20 Women World Cup.” He added: “I am in contact with FIFA… we will deploy every positive means needed to see that Nigeria hosts the championship because the country has what it takes to host the women cadet championship.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
