A student of the Ekiti State University Ado Ekiti (EKSU) identified as Bukola Odeyemi, allegedly stabbed her boyfriend, John Iju, to death. The alleged murder, according to eyewitnesses was committed at Treasure Base Hostel at Iworoko Ekiti, Irepodun/Ifelodun Local Government Area of Ekiti State. The 20-year-old Odeyemi is a 300 level student of the Department of Biology Education. The deceased, 22, was also an EKSU student. Witnesses said the incident occurred at about 10 pm on Tuesday and the fracas was said to have broken out after the suspect had demanded a sum N2,500 from the deceased to plait her hair. Iju reportedly turned down the request. “The refusal of the boyfriend to meet up with her demand resulted in hot argument, which angered the lady and they started fighting,” a witness who pleaded anonymity told The Guardian. “During the fight, the deceased was said to have had the upper hand and the lady now saw a sharp knife on the tray and stabbed the deceased in the chest with it.” The deceased’s friends were said have rushed him to the police station at Iworoko to lodge a complaint against the suspect. The Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti State Command, DSP Caleb Ikechukwu told The Guardian that the suspect is now in police detention. Ikechukwu explained that investigation has begun into the matter and the suspect will be charged to court as soon as the police conclude its findings.
