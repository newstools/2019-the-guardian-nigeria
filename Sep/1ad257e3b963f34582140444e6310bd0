Companies cannot employ people when insecurity has not been addressed. Security is fundamental. The primary assignment of any government is to address insecurity. “Forum is an opportunity for government to address considering the ease of doing business. We will keep on creating awareness until government addresses the issue, which is one of the fundamental issues in the country, “Ayeku said.
