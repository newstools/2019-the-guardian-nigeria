 Karate  The clinic, according to the instructors, was organised to groom more young boys and girls on the act of self-defense and also create a platform for them to discover their talents at the formative stage. Speaking at the event, owner of Vicamen Academy, Sensei Victor Akhimien, a fifth-degree National Black Belt holder, said the clinic, apart from teaching children the techniques of the combat sport, also exposed the kids to how to endure life challenges, as they grow older in life. Akhimien, who is also the president of Shitoryu Karate Association of Nigeria (SKAN), said it was important for parents to give their wards the opportunity to discover their skills in any sport at their tender age, as it would make the child develop faster. “After their lessons, they were upgraded to different belt colours, including white, yellow, green and other categories. Any certificate awarded here is recognised by Nigeria Karate Federation. “The whole essence of this clinic is to build a sense of confidence in the children. Parents are not always around with these children sometimes when they face life challenges like being molested or bullied. So learning the art of Karate gives them the skills to overcome life challenges, endure pressures that would make them commit suicide. “As the children learn more in the academy, they are expected to be disciplined in their conduct among their peers,” he said.
