 The vandalised vehicle in the governor’s wife convoy… yesterday.  The wife of the governor was in Oye Local Council of the state in continuation of her advocacy programme when the irate protesters emerged from the Ikole end of the town and started smashing any vehicle, including buses attached to Mrs. Fayemi’s convoy. On her way out of the venue of her empowerment programme, policemen attached to her convoy shot sporadically into the air to rescue her from the scene of the protest. Journalists, some civil servants, and policemen in her convoy sustained the various degree of injuries inflicted on them by the protesters. It was gathered that students who had protested against incessant outage in the morning and called on Federal Government to assist them, had dispersed. Meanwhile, a source disclosed that two police AK-47 rifles were seized while a Hilux van belonging to the police was set ablaze and one unidentified protester was feared dead. However, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Ekiti Command, Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Caleb Ikechukwu, confirmed the attack on the governor’s wife. Ikechukwu explained that the students protested in the morning and blocked the Ifaki-Ikole-Omuo highway and prevented the free flow of vehicles. “The students did not allow vehicles to move freely and they vandalised the property of Benin Electricity Distribution Company. “When police went there to dialogue with them, they resisted them. And the wife of the governor who went on local council tour ran into the barricade mounted on the road. “The students were reported to have been violent destroying cars and smashing the windscreen of vehicles. “We want to warn that the command would not tolerate hooliganism under any guise. We want to assure the public that the police are on top of the situation and our people must go about their normal businesses,” he said.
