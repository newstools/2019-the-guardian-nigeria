 [FILES] Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State.  The governor, while speaking with journalists yesterday in Yola, said that the security mechanism put in place could not allow kidnappers to operate in the state. He said that no kidnapper would enter Kano State and spend one week without being arrested by security agents due to the security network. Ganduje said that the kingpin kidnapper that kidnapped the Sarkin Magaji Daura from Katsina State was arrested in Kano and also, the ring-leader of the gang that attacked the convoy of Nasarawa State governor where four people were killed was arrested in Kano. Besides, the Kano State governor said that the strengthening of institutions and making education the priority of government and youthsâ€™ empowerment had helped his administration in caging criminal activities in the state. He said that uniform security operatives alone could not solve the security challenges in the country unless the local residents are incorporated to help in providing intelligence gathering and other important information.
