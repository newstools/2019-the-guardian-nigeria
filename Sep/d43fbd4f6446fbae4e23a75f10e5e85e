Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, suffered one of the biggest defeats of his career after April elections when he failed to form a coalition despite his right-wing Likud and its allies winning a majority of seats. Rather than risk having Israeli President Reuven Rivlin choose someone else to form a government, Netanyahu, who could be indicted on corruption charges in the coming weeks, opted for a second election instead. Final opinion polls released Friday indicated another tight race between Likud and the centrist Blue and White alliance led by ex-military chief Benny Gantz, and a repeat stalemate cannot be ruled out. The poll is expected to once again amount largely to a referendum on Netanyahu.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
