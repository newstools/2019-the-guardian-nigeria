Troops of 22 Brigade Super Camp and Civilian Joint Task Force (JTF) have neutralised several Boko Haram terrorists in Gworege border community of Borno State. The repulsion of insurgents in Saturday’s attack followed credible information from the locals. Army spokesman, Col. Sagir Musa, stated yesterday in Maiduguri that the soldiers conducted a successful raid and clearance operations. “The terrorists engaged the troops in a fire fight, but had to flee as a result of superior fire power of troops. “Consequently, troops cordoned off and searched the village and recovered six AK-47 rifles and ammunition.” He said many terrorists met their waterloo during the encounter, while others fled with gunshot wounds.
