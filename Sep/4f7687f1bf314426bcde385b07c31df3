Nigeria’s Department for State Security (DSS) Sunday arrested an activist, Chido Onumah. Onumah, a journalist and coordinator of African Centre for Media & Information Literacy (AFRICMIL) was arrested at the Abuja airport on Sunday evening. The journalist returned to Nigeria from Spain where he recently bagged a doctorate in communication studies. He arrived via a Lufthansa airline and was waiting for his luggage at about 5:00 p.m. when he was arrested. Confirming his arrest, AFRICMIL in a statement  demanded the immediate release of the journalist. “AFRICMIL condemns in strong terms the unjustifiable arrest of Mr Onumah and demands his immediate and unconditional release,” AFRICMIL spokesman Abdulaziz Abdulaziz said in the statement. “Waylaying law-abiding citizens should not be turned into the preoccupation of an entire security outfit.” The DSS is, however, yet to speak on Onumah’s arrest.
