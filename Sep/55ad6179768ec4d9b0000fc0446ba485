PHOTO: Townsquare Contrary to previous reports, American rapper and business mogul Kanye West may no longer release his highly anticipated album “Jesus Is King” on Friday. According to Variety, this latest development was made known by a source close to the rapper. In a tweet on the upcoming album, New York Times’ pop music reporter, Joe Coscarelli also echoed the reports, saying he’s “hearing from many industry people that “Jesus Is King” is not coming on Friday, despite people on the ground in Wyoming trying to make it happen.”  It is also reported that Def Jam executives recently had a meeting at the rapper’s new property in Wyoming. However, as of now, the label has not yet addressed the rumour about Kanye’s album release being postponed. The confirmation of the Friday, September 27 release date was made public by Kim Kardashian in an Instagram post in late August when she revealed the title and tracklist of the highly spiritual album. With the following tracklist: Glade, Garden, Seleh, God Is, Baptized, Sierra Canyon, Hands On, Wake the Dead, Water, Through the Valley, Sunday and Sweet Jesus, “Jesus Is King ” is a move away from Yandhi, an album which West was set to release last year. However, the release of Yandhi was delayed several times before being postponed indefinitely. West later tweeted in November that it “isn’t ready yet.”
