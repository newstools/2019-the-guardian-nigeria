 Enugu state governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi  The 22 students, accompanied by the Permanent Secretary, State Ministry of Education, Mrs. Nwanneka Onah, and other officials, said they were overwhelmed by Ugwuanyi’s benevolence, love, care and kindness in making their dreams come true. It would be recalled that the administration had offered four-year scholarships to 680 indigent students of the state studying engineering programmes in Enugu State Polytechnic Iwollo, Ezeagu Local Government and the Institute of Management and Technology (IMT), Enugu. Speaking on behalf of the new beneficiaries, Clara Nnaji, an ex-student of Anglican Girls Grammar School, Awkunanaw, Enugu South Local Government, thanked Ugwuanyi for putting smiles on their faces and that of their parents, adding that they have found a father in the governor. Earlier in her introductory remark, Onah stated that the scholarship was the offshoot of the visit of the Pro-Chancellor of Mewar University, India, to the governor on May 2019, “requesting for collaboration with the Enugu State Government to send some students on scholarship at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels”.
