They are players who deserve that liberty, and we shouldn’t worry, as they are very committed to Barca. “We want Messi to play for Barca through to 2021 and beyond. We are very calm.” Messi, Barca’s record goalscorer, is currently out injured with a calf injury, with the team struggling in his absence, managing to collect just four points from their opening three La Liga matches.
