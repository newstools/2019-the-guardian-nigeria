The 'Lion King' star has been fighting wedding planner Wendy Morales over the trademark for "Blue Ivy."  In new court documents obtained by The Blast, Beyoncé lists her daughter, Blue, as a "cultural icon." Beyoncé and Morales have been locked in a dispute over the trademark for years. Bey has been trying to get the trademark to her daughter’s name, but Morales claims she had already been using it. They are scheduled to head to trial in the case. Beyoncé says Morales claim that, “that consumers are likely to be confused between a boutique wedding event planning business and Blue Ivy Carter, the daughter of two of the most famous performers in the world, is frivolous and should be refused in its entirety.” Beyoncé points out her trademark application is for “Blue Ivy Carter” NOT “Blue Ivy”. Beyoncé says Morales runs a “small business, with just three regional offices and a handful of employees”, with weak online presence and poorly subscribed social media accounts.
