Lagos State Government has revealed that of the 4.8m registered taxpayers only about 700,000 are paying. It, therefore, implored residents to perform their civil responsibility of paying taxes, alongside actively participating in the governance process. The Commissioner for Economic Planning and Budget, Mr. Samuel Egube stated this at the Year 2020 Budget stakeholders’ meeting for Lagos Central Senatorial district. At the forum were representatives of community and professional associations, traditional rulers and civil societies. Egube stated that government policies and programmes would not make the needed impact if the citizens and those in government failed to interact and engage. According to him, it was the reason the state government felt in preparing the 2020 budget for the state, it should go round the three senatorial districts to get inputs of residents in drawing up the state projects and programmes for the budget. “This forum did not hold for two years but our belief is that we are servants of the people and we get to government through them, reason their opinions and voices must be reflected in the policies of government.” The Special Adviser, Economic Planning and Budget, Mr. Adebayo Sodade said the 2020 budget is being designed to be people-oriented to ensure a Lagos that works for all, irrespective of age, gender, tribe or status.
