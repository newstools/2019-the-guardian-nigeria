 United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO)  Katagun, however, vowed to use her working experience in UNESCO as a veritable tool in her new job as a minister, to ensure that Artificial Intelligence (IT) and culture create employment for Nigerian women and youths. She further disclosed that she took the ministerial appointment with the utmost responsibility to see that women are empowered and become part of the decision-making process in the country. While receiving UNESCO’s Director, Regional Office, Abuja, Yao Ydo, who paid her a courtesy visit in Abuja, she reiterated that the ministry would adopt a sectoral approach to issues to revive the moribund and ailing industries in the country. The UNESCO chief, Ydo, congratulated the minister on her new appointment, stressing that UNESCO will support her to succeed, as her absence from the global institution would be felt. He stated that the minister is a worthy ambassador of the agency, adding that while serving at UNESCO, she assisted in promoting not only Nigeria but also defended the interest of Africa as a whole. “She was one of the best representatives of the African ambassadors at the UN agencies,” he said. However, Ydo advised her to ensure the rapid development of the creative industry through culture, which will bring job creation, assuring that UNESCO will continue to support the trade and industry sector to bring about economic growth and development.
