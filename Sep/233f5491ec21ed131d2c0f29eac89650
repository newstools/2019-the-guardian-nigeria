Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare has promised to wade into the situation concerning the coach of the Nigeria women’s national football team, Thomas Dennerby. The Swedish coach, who signed a two-and-a-half-year contract to lead the Super Falcons in January 2018, left the country amidst talks of quitting his role over claims that some influential members of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) were interfering in his work. In reaction to the claims that Dennerby had quit as the Super Falcons coach, the minister said he will make sure the coach continues in his role and smoothen whatever the current friction could be. “I have personally stepped into the matter of Thomas Dennerby, the Coach of Super Falcons. I received a brief this morning and will proceed to seek a quick resolution to ensure he continues to Coach Nigeria’s female team,” the minister said.
