The president of National Association of Nigerian Students Danielson Bamidele Akpan has disassociated himself from the free trip to South Africa organised for some Nigerian youths by its mission in Nigeria. South African High Commissioner, Bobby Monroe, on Wednesday, summoned factional members of the association to offer them a free trip to South Africa to douse the tension over xenophobic attacks in the country. Akpan told journalists that the coalition of youths who received the offer are “saboteurs and unpatriotic citizens”, adding that they would be sanctioned appropriately. He said he had refused to honour the high commissioner’s invitation for negotiations because “at this stage, it is time for action.” The tension between Nigeria and South Africa spiked this week over xenophobic attacks on Nigerians in South Africa following the report of fresh attacks on Saturday. Nigeria government Wednesday recalled its ambassador to South Africa Kabiru Bala over the persistent attacks and killing of foreigners in the country, government-owned News Agency of Nigeria said. Nigeria also pulled out of the World Economic Summit holding in Cape Town on Wednesday. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari sent an envoy to South Africa on Tuesday to “express Nigeria’s displeasure over the treatment of her citizens”. The government said the special envoys sent will among others demand a compensation payment for Nigerians who have suffered loss in the latest waves of attacks on businesses owned by foreigners. “It is just those two key issues, the compensation payment and what security mechanism be put in place to make sure that these kinds of attacks do not recur,” Nigeria’s foreign affairs minister, Geoffery Onyeama, said on Tuesday. According to South African police said five people have been killed in the violence.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
