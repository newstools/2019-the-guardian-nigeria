In the face of the latest xenophobic assault on Nigerians residing in South Africa, the Nigerian government said it will begin the evacuation of Nigerians willing to leave the country. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, who disclosed this arrangement on Wednesday, added that one of the airlines operating in Nigeria, Air Peace, will begin the evacuation exercise on Friday. According to him, the development is made possible by the Proprietor of Air Peace Airlines, Chief Allen Onyema, who has volunteered to send an aircraft each daily from Friday, to evacuate Nigerians who may wish to return to Nigeria, free of charge. The government, therefore, urged Nigerians who have relations in South Africa to inform them of the development. “Interested Nigerians are therefore advised to liaise with the High Commission of Nigeria in Pretoria and the Consulate General of Nigeria in Johannesburg for further necessary arrangement”, the Nigerian government stated.
