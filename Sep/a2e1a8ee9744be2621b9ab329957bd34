The Senior Special Advisor on Industrialisation to African Development Bank’s President, Prof. Banji Oyelaran-Oyeyinka has advised Nigeria to formulate strategies that will foster availability of food and export of agro products to check unemployment and reduce poverty. Oyebanji, speaking at the two-day event of Feed Nigeria Summit, themed, ‘Unlocking prosperity through partnership’ said: “Nigeria needs to formulate appropriate and sustainable strategies; build capabilities of various sectors for dynamic agro-industrialisation, and foster domestic and export competitiveness in the agro-business industry, with the aim to generate jobs, reduce poverty, improved livelihoods and quality of lives through increased contribution of manufacturing to Gross Domestic Product (GDP).”He stressed that Nigeria, like other African countries, needed to focus on exporting processed agro-products. “However, it is evidently important to identify which are priority products for individual countries, in terms of food security and export advantage,” he said. He listed some of the reasons Nigeria and other African countries lag behind in industrial agriculture to include low quality products; low productivity of African farmers, compared to other developing countries and biases against processed goods imports in form of tariff and non-tariff barriers to exports from Africa.
