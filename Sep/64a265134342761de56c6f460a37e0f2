Claire Pierangelo The United States of America (U.S) Consul General to Nigeria, Claire Pierangelo has affirmed that participation in sports teaches leadership, teamwork, and communication skills that help young people succeed in all areas of their lives.

Speaking at the Iyoba College in Benin, the Edo state capital, at the launch of U.S. Consulate Girls’ Mentoring and Football Programme entitled: “Goal! Strong Girls, Bright Future,” Pierangelo expressed the U.S. government’s commitment to empowering at-risk girls with valuable life skills through their participation in sports.
