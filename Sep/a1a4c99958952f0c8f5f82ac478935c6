 Gov. Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi  Mr Jacob Shekarau, who specialises in shea product development, was speaking to newsmen at the weekend at the Farin Ruwa Village while supervising shea cluster groups engaging in the processing of shea nuts, preparatory for exports. If established, the institute, according to the consultant, would provide the necessary information, capacity development, packaging and price intelligence to farmers and other stakeholders in the export and value chain development with a view to taking competitive advantage to market agricultural produce from the state. The abandoned facilities at the school have not been put to use since its establishment more than seven years ago. Also speaking, the state Secretary of Federation of AgriculturalÂ Commodities Associations of Nigeria, Abubakar Bagudu Kalgo, commended the Federal Government for the decision to close borders to curtail rice smuggling into the country, describing it as remarkable and good for the food production investments. Shea products from the state have been globally acknowledged as of good quality, which attracts buyers from all over West African countries to markets and villages in the 14 local government areas with commercial availability of the products. In Bagudo Local Government area, hundreds of women and youth groups are engaged in the shea value chain activities which provide means of livelihood and sustainability to them and loved ones.
