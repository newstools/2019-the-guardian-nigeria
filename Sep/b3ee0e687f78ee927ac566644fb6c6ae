Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) has condemned Katsina State Governor Aminu Masari for negotiating with armed kidnappers and bandits. In a position paper signed yesterday in Abuja by the National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko, and the National Media Affairs Director, Miss Zainab Yusuf, the pro-democracy non-governmental organisation said such action was an insult to the laws of the country, which empowers the government to legally punish felons and hoodlums. HURIWA affirmed that the emerging illegality of northern states dialoguing with mass murderers and kidnappers could only achieve peace of the graveyard and would amount to rewarding criminality.
