Nigerian Police Wednesday arraigned journalist Agba Jalingo at a Federal High court in Cross River for alleged treason against Cross River State government. Jalingo has been in police detention for 35 days after publishing an article revealing how Governor Ben Ayade allegedly approved and diverted N500m meant for Cross River Microfinance Bank. He was thereafter charged to court by the police for a four counts charge bordering on “acts of treason, treasonable felony, and threatening through various publications on crossriverwatch.com and social media, using malicious publications. Also stated in the charge against Jalingo, was an alleged instigation of the people of Nigeria to stage protest for the removal of the Governor of Cross River State of Nigeria from office without due process of law and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 41 of the Criminal Code Act, Cap C38, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004. He was also alleged of plans to work with embattled Sahara Reporters publisher Omoyele Sowore, “cult members,” and a local prince to “commit acts of terrorism” to unseat Ayade, according to the charge sheet. On August 27, in response to his arrest and ongoing detention, Jalingo sued the Nigerian police, seeking damages of 150 million naira ($414,364), citing wrongful imprisonment and mistreatment, and demanding his immediate release, according to court documents seen by CPJ.
