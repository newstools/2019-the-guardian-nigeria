The Nigeria  Police Intelligence Response Team has arrested most wanted kidnap kingpin,  Bello Audu, also known as  Commander Yellow, whose gang had been terrorising Abuja-Kaduna-Kano Expressway. 40-year-old Yellow has been on the police watch list for armed robbery, murder, rape and kidnapping for a long period of time until he was picked up by IRT operatives, led by DCP Abba Kyari. Yellow has confessed that he successfully carried out over 50 Kidnappings and that his gang has killed many innocent Nigerians during operations. “Yellow was leading a formidable gang that has killed many people,” a police source told The Guardian. The gang has no mercy as it killed anyone who failed to pay ransom at the exact time it requested for it. “The members would abuse their female victims. The worst of it all was that they would kill a victim and still collect ransom.  We thank God that he and many Of his Key gang members  have been apprehended by IRT.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
