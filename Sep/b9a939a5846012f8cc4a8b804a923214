Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has nominated 26-year-old Joana Nnazua Kolo to the State House of Assembly for approval as commissioner. Kolo, currently undergoing the one-year compulsory National Youth Service Corps in Jigawa State, is one of four women whose names were sent and were read at the Kwara State House of Assembly on Tuesday. Other women nominated were Sa’adatu Modibbo-Kawu; Arinola Fatimoh Lawal and Aisha Ahman Pategi. Kolo, the youngest commissioner-nominee in the state’s history, is a 2018 graduate of Library Science from the Kwara State University (KWASU). She is teaching at Model Boarding Junior Secondary School Guri as her NYSC primary assignment. Her screening for the cabinet seat would hold after she rounds off her NYSC service in the next two weeks. If confirmed, she would be Nigeria’s youngest commissioner, taking over from 27-year-old Oluwaseun Fakorede, Oyo State’s Commissioner for Youths and Sport.
