Is it allowed that they fight more than us? No. That they run more than us? No. That they do more than us? No.” Klopp made 11 changes for his side’s 2-0 League Cup victory at MK Dons in midweek and is expected to return to the team that continued their 100 percent start to the league season with a 2-1 win at Chelsea last weekend. Sadio Mane was forced off with an injury at Stamford Bridge but has been passed fit to start, while goalkeeper Alisson Becker is still out despite returning to full training this week.
