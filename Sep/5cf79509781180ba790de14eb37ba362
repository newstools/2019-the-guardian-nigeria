The organisers of the World Robotic Olympiad (WRO) on Friday said that the 2019 edition of the competition was now set to hold in Lagos at the Oriental Hotel, Victoria Island, on Saturday. The 2019 WRO Nigeria serves as the qualification stage to the upcoming WRO in Gyor, Hungary from Nov. 8 to Nov. 10, the qualifiers may have about 22,000 participants according to the organisers. The theme for the 2019 WRO is “Smart Cities”. The 2019 WRO Nigeria was put together by Arc Lights Foundation Academy, a programme which has been on since 2014. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Arc Light Foundation are the exclusive partners of LEGO in Nigeria and LEGO Education in West Africa, and organisers of the World Robots Olympiad, an annual event that draws participants from across the world. The organisation seeks to set up a framework aimed at developing and improving the art of robotic science in Nigeria and Africa at large. The programme is set with knowledge-based scientific training on robotic science and focuses on refining, equipping and transforming schools, educators and parents. The participants for the WRO Nigeria are drawn from across public and private schools in Lagos having gone through tutorials from their teachers. The convener of the WRO Nigeria, Mrs Abisola Obasanya, said there had been a significant improvement in the knowledge of robotic science since its introduction to the school curriculum within five years. “We are so excited about the progress of robotic science since its introduction to the curriculum in the last four years. It has been a remarkable improvement. “The children have done well or to say, exceptionally well, this time around with the focus on more points derived during the competition and this has shown that the knowledge is fast gaining ground,” she said.
