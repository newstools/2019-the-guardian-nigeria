 [FILE] Badminton  The two-day championship, according to the organisers, will feature six badminton clubs from across Lagos State. Speaking ahead of the championship, chairman, Badminton Section of Ikoyi Club 1938, Kassim Abdul Rahman said the first edition of the AIICO championship would attract players from different backgrounds. “The AIICO Badminton Championship is all about imbibing the spirit of competition and friendliness among players. “Badminton needs more awareness in the country because it is not an everyday game like football or Table Tennis, which you see on the streets. “The Ikoyi Club 1938 is putting this event together with our sponsor, AIICO Insurance to showcase the club’s commitment to promoting the game of Badminton. Children will also compete in the event as a way of catching them young. “This is the fifth in the series of championships that have been organised by the club so far this year. We thank AIICO Insurance for supporting the event,” he said. Also speaking on the championship, Head of AIICO Insurance Strategy/Marketing Communications, said the company decided to sponsor the event because of its commitment to sports development in the country. The six teams in the championship are Police College Badminton Club, Railway Institute Badminton Club, Nigeria Air Force Badminton Club, Ikoyi Club 1938 and LA Global Badminton Club.
