President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday restated his administration’s commitment in tackling corruption, insisting that the government under his watch will leave no stones unturned to rid the country of graft. He stated this at the 74th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA74) in New York, United States of America, insisting: “The present Nigerian government is facing the challenges of corruption head-on.” Presenting the country’s statement as fifth speaker on the first day of General Debate, the President also cautioned: “We are giving notice to international criminal groups by the prosecution of the P&ID scam in which the firm and other unpatriotic elements attempted to cheat Nigeria of billions of dollars.” In a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina in Abuja, he held social media outlets responsible for fuelling major crimes such as mass killings and charged major technology firms to be alive to their responsibilities. “They cannot be allowed to continue to facilitate the spread of religious, racist, xenophobic and false messages capable of inciting whole communities against each other, leading to loss of many lives. This could tear some countries apart.“No threat is more potent than poverty and exclusion. They are the foul source from which common criminality, insurgency, cross-border crimes, human trafficking and other terrible consequences draw their inspiration,” he stated. Describing poverty as one of the greatest challenges facing the world and highlighting his administration’s efforts aimed at overcoming the challenge, Buhari noted: “Its eradication is an indispensable requirement for achieving sustainable development.” On the 2019 presidential elections, he said: “Our people backed the politics of tolerance, inclusion and community over the politics of protest and division.”The President also reaffirmed Nigeria’s position on certain issues, which impinge on global peace, security, progress, democracy and development. “Firstly I wish to thank the General Assembly for the honour bestowed on the Government and people of Nigeria by electing our national, Tijjani Muhammad-Bande to the Presidency of the 74th Session of this august body. This is indeed a great honour! “Nigerians are truly grateful and shall endeavour to live up to the expectations and responsibilities thrust upon us. Muhammad-Bande is an experienced and seasoned diplomat and I am confident that he will prove to the International Community his suitability for this most demanding assignment. “Let me also offer my sincere thanks to the outgoing President, Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces for her skill, resourcefulness and endless reservoir of patience in piloting the 73rd General Assembly.“In the same vein, may I commend the Secretary General, Antonio Guterres for his tremendous energy, his genuine international outlook exhibited by his leadership of the UN. “The theme of the 74th General Assembly, “Galvanising Multilateral Efforts for Poverty Eradication, Quality Education, Climate Action and Inclusion,” is very apt since these are the prime areas that require collective action, which will benefit national and global interests,” the statement reads.
