A non-Governmental Organisation, Centre for Citizens With Disabilities (CCWD) yesterday criticised the Kano State Government over non-implementation of disability laws nine months after signing the bill into law. Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje signed the Kano State Persons Living With Disability (PWDs) Laws in December 2018, to guarantee and enforce the fundamental human rights of people with disabilities. The law focused especially on education, health, education, employment opportunities and participation in politics, among other needs as enshrined in the United Nations (UN) charter on people with disabilities. Speaking at a stakeholders meeting with PWDs in Kano, Executive Director of CCWD David Obina Annele worried over the neglect since signing it into law, insisting that the continued delay constituted an infringement on the rights of PWDs. Annele, who was represented by focal person for SCRACP-C project, Mrs. Peace Ezekiel Ndubusi, said in spite of the giant strides of the Ganduje-led government in the signage of the bill, it has not shown cause why the laws will remain dormant nine months after.
