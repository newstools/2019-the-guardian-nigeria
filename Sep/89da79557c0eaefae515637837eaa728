The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Plateau State has reacted to the judgement of the Supreme Court, which overruled both the governorship election petitions tribunal and the Court of Appeal sitting in Jos. In a statement yesterday by its secretary, Alhaji Bashir Sati, Plateau APC said the ruling allowing the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate to present witnesses at the tribunal did not mean victory for the opposition party. The APC urged its members, supporters and the public to disregard the misinterpretation of the apex court’s judgement “by overzealous supporters” of PDP.It told its supporters that there was no cause for concern, urging them to remain calm and law-abiding, as the mandate was still intact. The PDP governorship candidate, Gen. Jeremiah Useni (rtd.), had brought witnesses that were not initially listed to testify at the tribunal, which was disallowed. PDP, therefore, went to the Court of Appeal to challenge that decision and the appellate court ruled in favour of the APC, insisting that those witnesses were not listed. Not satisfied by the decision of the appellate court, PDP approached the Supreme Court, which overruled the decisions of the appellate court and upheld the appeal of the PDP legal team. The apex court has ruled that its judgement must be served on the tribunal for its consideration of the decision before its judgement on or before October 9.
