The global pursuit of financial inclusion as a vehicle for economic development has yielded a positive impact in Nigeria as the exclusion rate has reduced from 53.0 % in 2008 to 36.8% in 2018. Despite overall progress, the gender gap still remains. According to the EFInA Access to Financial Services in Nigeria, 57% of women were financially excluded as against 49% men in 2008. In 2018, 41% of women are still excluded against 33% of the male counterpart. The gender gap increased from 7 in 2008 to 8 percentage points in 2018, indicating a systemic obstacle to women financial inclusion in Nigeria. Some of the factors driving financial exclusion among women stem from institutional, cultural barriers and socio-economic constraints. In some markets especially in gender-segregated societies, women have limited access to public spaces, identification documents, bank accounts, mobile phones, and economic activities.

There is a predisposition that women offer better customer experience and women are more likely to access financial services from agent of same gender. Microsave studies have shown that Female agents create a reassuring environment for transactions for both male and female clients. Customers feel that female agents have more patience and are more willing to spend time to address queries or explain the features of a new product. However, there is no or little representation of women in agent banking across markets. More women in agent banking may be the key to close the gender gap in financial access in Nigeria. More intentional action is needed to encourage more participation of women in agent banking. According to GSMA study, enlisting female agents may be the most effective way to overcome low literacy rates, and build women’s confidence and trust in using financial services. Providers need to consider the following while formulating their agent network strategy for women: In conclusion, providers need to understand the women segment of their agent network.
