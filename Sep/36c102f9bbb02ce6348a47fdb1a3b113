 MTN signage  Also, all MTN offices and retail outlets in Port Harcourt were yesterday shut down due to fear of possible attacks over the xenophobic crisis in South Africa. The multinational telecommunication offices at Rumuola, Rumuokuta, Rumuokwurusi, Artillery, Aggrey Road in Port Harcourt were completely under lock and key. Customers were turned back by security men. In a similar vein, Shoprite retail outlets in Warri and Asaba, Delta State, have literally been taken over by armed soldiers. Both retail stores are presently under lock and key as management shut down operations to avert reprisal attack on property linked to South Africans. It was learned that military men were deployed to the stores yesterday night on the request of the management to prevent looting. The South African-owned Shopping Mall based in the heart of Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, ‘Shoprite’, has remained closed since Monday. When The Guardian visited the place yesterday along ‘Fate’ Road, the shopping mall was under lock and key and guarded by armed police officers numbering over 50. But the main gate into the premises was widely opened allowing customers and workers of two commercial banks in the area easier access. Spokesman of the state’s Police Command, DSP Ajayi Okasanmi, said the command would ensure proper security of lives and property at the mall. Meanwhile, security operatives have manned all South African-owned businesses in Kaduna. The Guardian observed that both Multichoice and MTN offices in Kaduna were under lock and key with policemen strategically positioned on power bikes.
