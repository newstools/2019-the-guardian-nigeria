• Over 100 balls arrive in Nigeria
As part of efforts to reposition volleyball in the country, the Nigeria Volleyball Federation’s (NVF) Ambassador in Diaspora, Prince Babatunde Omisore has disclosed that over 100 balls would arrive in the country on Saturday for various stakeholders of the game. According to Prince Omisore, the exercise tagged, ‘Operation Keep The Volleyballs Flying In Nigeria’ is focused on ensuring that quality volleyballs are available to various states and clubs. He said the prices of the indoor and beach balls shipped into Nigeria are at subsidized rates, adding, “the second phase of the Operation Keep The Volleyballs Flying In Nigeria order has been shipped to Nigeria and the balls will be in the country latest on Saturday. “Owners should be receiving them latest next week because the athletes’ representative of the Nigeria Volleyball Federation, Emmanuel Jatto will get the balls first. “I went back to Mikasa to negotiate a deal for Nigerian volleyball clubs, schools, military and states in order to subsidize the amount. Upon negotiation, the price for both MVA200 and VLS300 beach balls came down,” Omisore, who is the Osun State NVF chairman,” said. He added: “This MVA300 is special order from Japan. It will be manufactured for us specially to meet our outdoor/indoor use and they are more durable. “We have completed the first phase; the balls have been ordered in bulk from Mikasa and have been delivered to clubs and owners,” he added.
Omisore commended the NVF President, Musa Nimrod, for changing the face of volleyball within the space of two years, pledging to support the federation in all its activities. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
