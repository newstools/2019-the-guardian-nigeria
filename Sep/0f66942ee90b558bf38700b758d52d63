 Ogun state governor Dapo Abiodun  Ajibola made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abeokuta on Sunday. She noted that the poor state of the roads in her constituency has a negative effect on the economic activities of the local government area. Ajibola explained that economic activities were being scuttled as a result of the bad roads being used by commuters and motorists on a daily basis, saying that the local government is closer to the Benin Republic. The lawmaker stated that it was high time the people’s agitation for good roads yielded positive results. She noted that Iyana Ago-Ifereku road in Idiroko required immediate government intervention because of the length of the road. “I appeal to Gov. Dapo Abiodun to fix roads in Ipokia local government, the local government has no good road, all our roads are so bad, we have been clamouring for this and we have been agitating for so long but no one is coming to our rescue. “The governor should please do something as soon as possible on our roads. Some of these roads are lfonyintedo – Madigan road, Madoga-lmule road, Jolaco filling station – Mede – Owotedo – ldologun road in Ajegunle and Agosasa – Idoloisa road. “Others are Ihunbo – Ori Eke – lgborodo road, Community Secondary school – Water corporation road, Tube – Agosasa road and ljofin to ldosa road, all in my local government, Ipokia, “she said. Ajibola assured the people of his constituency that she will continue to be a good representative and ensure that what belongs to them is actually given to them.
