The 3rd edition of the annual 4- Inch Heel Race competition will hold on Friday, November 15 at Yaba College of Technology in Lagos.The competition is organized by DAK Marketing Services Limited (DMS), an integrated Marketing Communications company based in Lagos. 4-Inch Heel Race competition is a special sport event aimed at creating excitement and confident among young women in Nigeria. It is the first of its kind in Nigeria and Africa. It has featured only in three countries, the United States of America, Spain and Russia.Young Nigerian women between the ages of 18-35 will participate in the competition wearing 4-Inch heeled stilettos shoe to compete in a 100-meter race. Over the last two years, DAK Marketing Services Limited has successfully hosted the 4-Inch Heel Race Competition, with the last edition holding at the National Stadium, Surulere, Lagos. Speaking with journalists at the Lagos State Polytechnic, Isolo, yesterday, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, DAK Marketing Services Limited, Elder Dede Kalu stated that the event was geared towards giving Nigerian young women a platform to showcase their talents, and also to support their dreams. “This event is aimed at empowering and enlightening young ladies on how to be smart and confident on heels. The rationale behind it is that we are concerned about the numerous injuries ladies encounter almost on a daily basis when walking on the streets or crossing the roads wearing high heels because they lack the confidence to walk smartly on them. This has given us great concern to create this platform to address this issue effectively,” Kalu stated. Speaking further, he said the selection of participants would cut across graduates and undergraduates in higher institutions in Nigeria.“The 4-Inch Heel Race Competition is designed to be a 100 meter sprint competition. During the heat, participants will be grouped and race against themselves. The first three in each group will move to the next round till we have the finalists who will compete in the final to determine the winners.” Kalu disclosed that the overall winner would go home with fantastic prices in cash and materials and also be the face of the competition for a year executing various social projects. Meanwhile, the defending champion, Precious Chukwuma, an undergraduate student at the National Open University has described the race as best for Nigerian women.“Through the competition, I was exposed to a lot of things, and I want other Nigerians to experience it this year. I will not compete this time because I want other people to benefit from the race,” Chukwuma told The Guardian yesterday.
