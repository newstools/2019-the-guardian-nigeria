 Bayero University  With the 7.1 megawatts solar power plant, 55,815 students and 3,077 staff of the institution will have access to electricity. Besides, the project, which is the largest off-grid power plant in Africa, aims at developing independent power plants, rehabilitating existing distribution infrastructure to supply clean, safe and reliable power to 37 federal universities and seven affiliated university teaching hospitals in the country. Tagged Energising Education Programme (EEP), the project is implemented by the Rural Electrification Agency (REA), which had commissioned 11.41 kilometres of solar-powered street lights as well as a world-class renewable energy training centre. Managing director of REA, Mrs. Damilola Ogunbiyi, described the project as mission accomplished in the commitment of the Federal Government towards sustainable energy and education. She said, “Students and staff of Bayero University, Kano, can now experience learning and teaching in a safer, cleaner and more conducive academic environment. “There is also the graduation of 20 female students who participated in the Female STEM Students Internship Programme. The female students, who received practical training in the course of the project construction, would be awarded certificates of completion.” BUK is the second project to be commissioned under Phase 1 of the EEP that will deliver clean and sustainable energy to nine federal universities and one university teaching hospital in the next four years, using solar hybrid and/or gas-fired captive power plants. REA is the implementing agency of the Federal Government charged with electrification of un-served and underserved communities.
