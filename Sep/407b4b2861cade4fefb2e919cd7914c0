The Kano State governorship election tribunal will on Wednesday deliver judgement in the petition filed by People’s Democratic Party’s Abba Kabiru Yusuf, challenging the victory of All Progressives Congress’s Umaru Ganduje in the last governorship election in the state. The Guardian gathered that the tribunal communicated the date of the judgement to all parties involved Monday morning through telephone. The lawyers of both PDP and Governor Ganduje have confirmed the development. The governorship candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Abba Kabiru Yusuf is challenging the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) the declaration of Governor Ganduje as the winner of March general election. In a petition filed by Abba and PDP before the Justice Mohammad led tribunal, the petitioners demanded the tribunal to nullify the victory of the governor and declare the PDP winner. In their counter-response, counsel to Ganduje and APC wanted the tribunal to dismiss the petition insisted the Governor Ganduje won the lawful votes during the last election. In its defence, INEC insisted the inconclusive election was declared base on electoral law, thereby calling for the dismissal of Abba and Ganduje’s petition. Presiding Judge of the tribunal, Justice Halima Shamaki on September 18, reserved judgement after receiving the final submission of all parties.
