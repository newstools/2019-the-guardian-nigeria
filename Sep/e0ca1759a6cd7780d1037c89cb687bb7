Head of Sub-Saharan Africa, GSMA, Akinwale Goodluck, said a new generation of youthful ‘digital natives’ across SSA are set to fuel customer growth and drive adoption of new mobile services that are empowering lives and transforming businesses.“With mobile technology at the heart of Sub-Saharan Africa’s digital journey, it is essential for policymakers in the region to implement policies and best practices that ensure sustainable growth in the mobile industry, and enable the transition to next-generation mobile networks,” he noted.
