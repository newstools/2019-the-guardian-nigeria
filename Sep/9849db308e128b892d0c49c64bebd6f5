Former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Timi Frank, has urged the National Judicial Council (NJC) and Supreme Court to review President Muhammadu Buhari’s victory at the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal. Frank asked the international community to place visa restrictions on the five justices of the Appeal Court who presided over the miscarriage of justice and flagrant breach of the nation’s Constitution. Reacting to the recent judgement of the PEPT in favour of President Buhari, Frank in a statement in Abuja alleged that it was obvious that the judgement was written by elements in the Presidency. He said he was convinced that the ruling that it was not necessary to present certificates to contest political offices in the country has created problems for the nation’s education sector as it would now be difficult to convince the younger generation to go to school or tell them to study hard in their educational pursuits.
