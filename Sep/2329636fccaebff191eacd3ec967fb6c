Sprint hurdler, Tobilola Amusan is a lady on a mission. The African Senior Championship queen, who last week added the African Games gold medal to her rich trophy chest, yesterday showed that her rich vein of form is no fluke when she beat the field to add the ISTAF IAAF gold medal to her collection. Amusan’s 12.51 seconds at the ISTAF IAAF meeting at the Olympia Stadion (Olympic Stadium) in Berlin, Germany is her second-fastest time of all time. The 100 metres hurdler seems to be peaking at the right time with the World Championships fast approaching. If she continued in her current form, Amusan could become the second African after Glory Alozie to win a sprint hurdles title at the IAAF World Championships scheduled for Doha this month. Amusan in July set her new lifetime best of 12.49 seconds at the Meeting Pro Athlé Tour de Sotteville les Rouen in Sotteville, France. She is now the second African woman to break 12.50 seconds in the event after Alozie who ran 12.44 seconds in 1998. The petite Amusan will move over to Brussels on Friday as she attempts to become the first Nigerian to win the IAAF Diamond League title, a feat her compatriot, Blessing Okagbare failed to do in Zurich last week. She is currently the fourth fastest 100 metres hurdler this year and faces the formidable Jamaican, Danielle Williams, the current world leader with 12.32 seconds and U.S.’s world record holder, Kendra Harisson, who holds a personal season’s best of 12.43 seconds.
