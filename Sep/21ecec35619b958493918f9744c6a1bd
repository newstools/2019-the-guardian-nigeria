Pacquiao, who won a bruising 12-round battle with Keith Thurman to capture the WBA welterweight crown in July, has not scheduled his next fight. But Arum said he believed Pacquiao, who turns 41 in December, would be risking lasting damage if he extends his career much further. “Pacquiao, I promoted him for many, many years,” Arum told World Boxing News. “He’s an exceptionally good human being, really a fine guy, extraordinarily charitable and a delight. “But he’s (almost) 41-years-old. And if you’re 41 you can’t take punishment. You can’t take blows like he did in the Thurman fight. “Sure, he won that fight – but he took a lot of punishment. That punishment is going to have a serious effect on how he lives the rest of is life.” Arum, who earlier this year said he feared Pacquiao risked brain damage before his fight with Thurman, said however the Filipino should consider a rematch with Mayweather. Mayweather, who is now retired, defeated Pacquiao in their 2015 “Fight of the Century” which largely failed to live up to the hype. “If he gets Mayweather, do that fight and retire,” said Arum. “If he doesn’t get Mayweather he should retire. It’s not worth it for him to continue boxing.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
