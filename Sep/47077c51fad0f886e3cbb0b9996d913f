Jussie Smollett and Terrence Howard | Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images The actor Terrence Howard, who has been in a spousal support feud with his ex-wife and has been asked by the judge to pay his ex-wife, Michelle Ghent $1.3 million says he’s taking a stand for men when he battles his ex-wife. The actor who just got his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was at Bev hills where he was interviewed by the TMZ reporters. However, Michelle’s lawyers are of the opinion that Terrence is delusional, “Apparently the courts don’t agree with his version of events and he seems to have a hard time sticking to the facts and the reality of what the rulings have been in this case.” Terrence was asked if he intends to challenge the verdict, he, however, says he’ll pay … he clearly isn’t conceding Michelle is right. In fact, he accuses her of playing dirty with “deceit and lies.” Terrence Howard is one of the star actors in the film “Empire”. He has been married four times to three women and has five children and two grandchildren. In February 2009, it was reported on The Smoking Gun that Howard was arrested in 2001 for a variety of charges related to a violent attack on his estranged first wife, including simple assault, terrorist threats, harassment, and stalking. According to police reports, he arrived at her house after an argument on the phone, forced entry into her home by breaking in doors, and chased her into the backyard where he punched her twice in the face with a closed fist. The violent attack ended when Howard’s brother stepped in. In 2002, he pleaded guilty to disturbing the peace. In August 2013, Ghent obtained a second restraining order against him after showing up in court with a black eye she says he gave her. Howard initially denied hitting her but, later admitted in court to a “mutual” physical altercation, which he claimed included being pepper-sprayed by Ghent.
