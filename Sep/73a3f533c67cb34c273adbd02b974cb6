Chairman of the Alex Otti-led All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Abia State, Chief Nkem Okoro has condemned the application by a faction of the party in the state to withdraw APGA from the election petition filed by Otti, its guber candidate in the 2019 election. The petition was to challenge INEC’s declaration of Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the winner. Okoro, who made the denunciation at a news conference in Umuahia, accused the state PDP-led government of instigating the faction, led by Rev. Augustine Ehiemere to use the APGA withdrawal from the petition before the state Election Tribunal, as a strategy to scuttle Otti’s awaited petition victory.He said Otti’s legal team that filed the petition at the tribunal “has presented a watertight case to prove that the election in Abia State was a charade, a mockery of INEC and the Electoral guidelines and thus should not be allowed to stand.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
