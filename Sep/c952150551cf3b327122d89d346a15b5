 [FILE PHOTO] Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Hadiza Bala Usman  Concerning Port access roads nationwide, Bala Usman explained that the NPA has drawn a chart of such roads across the country and written to the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing about the need to prioritise the rehabilitation of the roads. 
   
She noted that the ministry has commenced the implementation process with the recent award of the construction of Ikom Bridge, which is a key road connecting Cross River State to the North Eastern part of the country.She expressed optimism that these steps would provide better linkages to the hinterland and attract more business to the Eastern Ports.
   
Chairman of the Ad-hoc Committee, Buba Yakub said that the committee was on a fact finding mission on reasons why the Eastern Ports are not working as optimally as the Western Ports and how much that affects national development.
Yakub noted that the committee would go round all the ports and generate a blue print that would improve patronage at the Eastern Ports and prevent agitations from host communities. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
