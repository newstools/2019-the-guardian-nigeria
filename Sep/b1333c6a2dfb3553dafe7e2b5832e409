Argungu Fishing Festival As part of the events leading up to the 2020 edition of the Argungu Fishing Festival, a special polo tournament was organized by the Kebbi State Government in partnership with Fayrouz. The brand threw its weight behind the special occasion, sponsoring one of the competing polo teams and delivering premium entertainment value as well as refreshing consumers with cold bottles of Fayrouz. The Fayrouz polo team went ahead to win the Emir of Argungu Cup after a successful group of games at the Argungu Polo Tournament. The Argungu Fishing Festival is a major celebration in the northwestern of the country, and the annual event marks the end of the ancient wars between the Sokoto caliphate region and the Kebbi Kingdom. Since the inaugural edition in 1934, the festival has been a source of tourist attraction as over 30,000 fishermen take part in the commemorative event. With the festival slated to hold in a few months, the Polo tournament provided the perfect prequel to its 85th anniversary. The event featured high profile patrons, like the Minister of Justice, Justice Abubakar Malami, the Governor of Kebbi State, Alhaji Atiku Bagudu, the Sultan of Sokoto, Sultan Muhammadu Saâ€™ad Abubakar, the Emir of Gwandu and Chairman, Kebbi Council of Chiefs, Alhaji Muhammadu Bashar, the Emir of Argungu Alhaji Samaila Muhammad Mera, the Emir of Bade, Alhaji Abubakar Umar Suleiman, the Emir of Keffi, Nasarawa State, Dr Shehu Yamusa and the Emir of Nasarawa, Alhaji Ibrahim Usman Jibril.
