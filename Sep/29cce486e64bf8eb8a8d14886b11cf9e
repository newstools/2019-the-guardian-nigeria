The French champions will likely start with a front three of Neymar, Angel Di Maria and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting at the Groupama Stadium. Lyon were widely tipped to be PSG’s closest challengers for the league title this term, but Sylvinho’s men sit eighth in the early table, four points behind the leaders. “It was tough last year (2-1 Lyon win) and it will be hard again this year, I’m expecting a Lyon in top form,” said German Tuchel. “We have to do the same things as against Real, but it’s not easy. It’s the challenge of playing with the same spirit, the same intensity.” By kick-off, PSG could find themselves knocked off top spot, as Andre Villas-Boas’ Marseille have a chance to move to the summit when they host Montpellier on Saturday.
