Some Nigerians on Tuesday attacked a South African-owned  Shoprite in Lekki, an obvious retaliation for the attacks on Nigerian businesses in south Africa. An eyewitness who shared her account with The Guardian said some youth invaded the shopping mall outlet in Lekki to vandalise it. She added that security operatives have since moved to contain the situation, dispersing the irate youths with tear gas and gunshots. The Guardian also noticed a police van at the Shoprite distribution centre on Oshodi-Apapa Expressway. The ongoing spate of violence in South Africa has seen the destruction of more than 50 mainly foreign-owned shops and business premises. South African police minister Bheki Cele dismissed reports the ongoing attacks were xenophobic. “Xenophobia is just an excuse that is being used by people to commit criminal acts,” he told reporters on Monday afternoon. “It is not xenophobia, but pure criminality.” Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari sent an envoy to South Africa on Tuesday to “express Nigeria’s displeasure over the treatment of her citizens”. In a statement, the country’s high commission in South Africa described the situation as “anarchy”. The government alleges that Nigerian-owned businesses were targeted in Johannesburg and it has called on Nigerians to come forward to report what has happened to them.
