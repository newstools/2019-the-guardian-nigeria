President of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), Ibikunle Baruwa, has dissolved the NURTW Lagos State Council. Baruwa took the decision yesterday at the national secretariat in Abuja following clashes and rift among leaders and members over control of Lagos council. The president, who said the dissolution did not affect branches and units, noted that the dissolution of the Lagos State Council was to bring sanity among members of the union. He appealed to them to go back to the state and resolve issues and disagreements they have with the association and maintain peace among themselves. According to him, “I am not going to condone any indiscipline among you in Lagos State, you have established the cause of the problem, zoning or no zoning, which is not important. What is paramount is to maintain peace in Lagos.”Baruwa and other leaders who admonished the Lagos leaders said leadership comes from God, no one should waste anybody’s life because he wants to lead. One of the leaders commended the wisdom of the president, a sign that he was ready to stand by law and the group’s constitution to move the organisation forward. He also urged the leaders to be their brother’s keeper and put a stop to nefarious activities. It would be recalled that one person was killed while many others were injured as hoodlums clashed on Lagos Island on Monday. The clash, which disrupted the masquerade festival on the Island, was allegedly caused by some factions of the NURTW. The clash, which started on Friday, resulted in one person losing his life and two others injured when it continued on Sunday. However, the hoodlums continued the fight on Monday in the Oke-Arin area with traders scampering for safety.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
