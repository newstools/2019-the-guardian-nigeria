Japanese international and former Leicester City forward Shinji Okazaki has left Malaga 34 days after he joined the Spanish second-tier club. Reports in Spain say the 33-year-old, has had his contract cancelled by mutual consent because his wages were not within the range of the Spanish club’s budget. Okazaki did not feature in Malaga’s three league matches this season before the cancellation of his one-year contract. Malaga commended Okazaki “for his commitment shown during this time and wishes him the best of luck for the future.” He left Leicester City in July 2019. The Japanese, now a free agent, won the Premier League with Leicester in 2016 and left this summer after scoring 19 goals in 137 games. On his departure from Leicester City, the club said Okazaki would be “forever revered” for the mark he made on fans. Okazaki was a member of Japan’s last three World Cup squads and has scored 50 goals in 119 internationals for the Japanese national team.
