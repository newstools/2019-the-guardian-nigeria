 [FILES] Presidential candidate of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party Atiku Abubakar  MEANWHILE, the All Progressives Congress (APC), yesterday, expressed optimism that the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal would uphold President Muhammadu Buhari’s victory at the poll. APC’s National vice-chairman South-south, Prince Hilliard Eta in a chat with The Guardian maintained that the outcome of the presidential poll won by President Buhari was a true reflection of the wishes of the majority of the electorate in the country. He noted: “Their case was built on nothing as far as the law is concerned. We have no fear or any form of apprehension about the outcome of the judgment of the Tribunal at all. The PDP case was predicated on the use of the INEC server, which is alien to the Electoral Act. We have successfully defended the mandate freely given by Nigerians to our party and to President Buhari.” He argued that salient issues raised by the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar relating to the legality of the use of the server had already been resolved in favour of the APC and President Buhari.
