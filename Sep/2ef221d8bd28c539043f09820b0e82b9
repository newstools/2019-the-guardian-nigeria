Are We Getting A New “Game Of Thrones” Prequel? PHOTO: Yahoo Glad tidings from the Seven Kingdoms! A new prequel of American fantasy drama series “Games of Thrones” is coming. According to Deadline, Author George R.R. Martin is working on a project set roughly 300 years before events depicted in “Game of Thrones”. The new project will track the beginning of the end for House Targaryen. The new series will follow Martin’s book “Fire & Blood”, the first volume of the two-part history of the Targaryens in Westeros. Martin will work with Ryan Condal, whose credits include co-creating the show “Colony” with “Lost” producer Carlton Cuse. Martin had been dropping clues about the House Targaryen prequel project all along.
In May, he wrote on his blog: “We have had five different Game of Thrones successor shows in development at HBO, and three of them are still moving forward nicely.” “Two other shows remain in the script stage, but are edging closer,” Martin wrote in May. “What are they about? I cannot say. But maybe some of you should pick up a copy of Fire & Blood and come up with your own theories.” “Fire & Blood” starts off with Aegon the Conqueror, creator of the Iron Throne, and goes on to recount the generations of Targaryens who fought to hold the throne, all the way up to the civil war, known as the Dance of the Dragons, that nearly tore their dynasty apart. “Game of Thrones” which is based on A Song of Ice and Fire, featured a couple of surviving Targaryens, including Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke), Viserys Targaryen (Harry Lloyd), and Jon Snow (Kit Harington). The show’s final season established a new record for most Emmy nominations received in the same year by any show with 32. Over its full eight seasons, the series has nabbed 161 nominations.
