 Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivers a statement outside 10 Downing Street in central London on September 2, 2019. – British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday said the chances of a Brexit deal with Brussels were “rising” but ruled out any delay to the October 31 deadline for Britain to leave the European Union if no agreement is struck. Johnson also said he did not want a general election and urged rebel Conservative MPs not to undermine his negotiations with Brussels by voting with the opposition on a draft law that might force him to postpone Brexit.

Scotland, for instance, voted overwhelmingly to remain in Europe. There is the assumption that agitation for its independence could gather momentum with current developments. The anti-no-deal sentiment cuts across party divisions. There are not a few who had voted in favour of Brexit but would want it achieved with minimal consequences to their well-being. In what would appear as a move towards countering whatever plot opponents intend, Boris Johnson promptly requested the British Monarch, Queen Elizabeth 11, to prorogue Parliament for 5 weeks, the longest suspension that would be witnessed since the end of the Second World War. Parliament would be suspended sometime in September and reconvene on the 14th of October, about seventeen days before Brexit deadline. Opponents believe the prorogue of Parliament was intended to frustrate discussions on Brexit. However, Prime Minister Johnson explained that the break is intended to enable the government to focus on urgent domestic legislation-an explanation that would seem to have contradicted his earlier pronouncement that domestic legislation would be put on hold until Brexit is achieved at the end of October. There have been mixed reactions to this new development, ranging from anger from political opponents of Johnson to approval by avowed supporters of Brexit. The move by the Prime Minister is considered to be anti-democratic and dictatorial. Former chancellor Phillip Hammond expressed his disapproval and wondered why anyone would not want to see why Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour Party, would like to table a motion of no confidence next week. However, proponents argue that opposing MPs have themselves to blame since they had thwarted the opportunities provided by Theresa May to exit Europe with a deal of some sort. Not unexpectedly, Donald Trump, the tweeting President of the United States, praised Johnson as the leader Britain needs at this crucial moment. Quite a number of politicians from countries of the European Union do not agree, wondering why the Prime Minister feared debate by elected representatives of the British people on an issue of immense implications for their future. Someone asked this writer why the Queen approved the request to suspend Parliament. The Queen, being a mere constitutional monarch, could hardly have rejected the request of her PM to prorogue Parliament without dragging herself into a constitutional mess. The era of omnipotent monarchy has long disappeared in history. Be that as it may, the weeks ahead promise to be quite exciting in British politics. It will be exciting to see how the opposition responds to what would seem to have been a delve move by Boris Johnson to achieve his deal or no-deal exit from the European Union by the 31st October deadline. There is hardly any doubt that new strategies will emerge in the few days before the suspension of Parliament commences, and the decisive days following its reconvening in October. There have been protests here and there and it is time that can tell what the eventual outcome would be.
