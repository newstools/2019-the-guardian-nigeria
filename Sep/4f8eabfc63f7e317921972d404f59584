However, as the governing Conservatives toughen their position under Prime Minister Boris Johnson, pressure is growing for Labour to campaign actively to stay in the EU. The issue is likely to spark intense debate at Labour’s party conference starting this weekend. Johnson insists Britain must leave the EU on October 31, with or without a deal with Brussels — although he is constrained by a law blocking “no-deal” next month. Meanwhile, the smaller Liberal Democrats agreed at their annual conference last weekend to reverse Brexit if they ever won a majority in the House of Commons. “We are the only UK-wide party ready to put our trust in the people of Britain to make the decision,” Corbyn wrote. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), tweeted: “Staying neutral on Brexit is a shameful abdication of leadership.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
