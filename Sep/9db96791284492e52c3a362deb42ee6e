 DisCos  Already, over 40 per cent of the plants have been shut down, as the level of power generation stood at a mere 2137.6 Megawatts on Wednesday this week going by statistics from the Nigeria Electricity System Operator.Indeed, generation hovered between 4214.4MW and 2137.6MW.
 
With the enforcement of the new order, which meant that DisCos would have to pay for 100 per cent of the energy sold to them, most of the utility operators are drastically reducing demand from GenCos, who are forced to reduce generation since the country lacks the capacity to store energy.TCN’s General Manager in charge of Nigeria Electricity System Operator, Emmanuel Umoh, said the decline in generation remains imminent because of low demand for electricity by the distribution companies.  Oke said to create headway, there is a need for aggressive metering to enable consumers to manage or control what they consume, a cost-reflective tariff, re-acquisition or re-financing of the current structure as well as massive education and enlightenment of the people, especially labour groups.
   
“Federal Government (NERC) must back-off from all forms of off-grid licensing and regulation and allow states to play very actively, as against passive roles. The legal and regulatory framework of the power sector is faulty, unrealistic and counter-productive. We need to urgently revise the law -Nigerian Electric Power Sector Reforms Act of 2005. It was merely intended as a “Reform” instrument or legislation. It was never intended as a legal document for operationalising the power sector in Nigeria.
