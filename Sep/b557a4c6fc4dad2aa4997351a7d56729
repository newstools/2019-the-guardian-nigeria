According to TMZ, Hart is now undergoing intensive physical therapy at an undisclosed live-in rehab facility, where he will likely remain for about one week.

After the accident, the Hart underwent back surgery for three spinal fractures. In the car with Hart was actor Jared S. Black, who was driving the vehicle, and Black’s fiancée, Rebecca Broxterman, who is the personal trainer of the comedian’s wife, Eniko Hart.
