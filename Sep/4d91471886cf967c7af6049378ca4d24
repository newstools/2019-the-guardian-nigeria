The roster is headlined by Neymar, who has recently returned from injury. Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Barbosa, Thiago Silva, and Casemiro have also been included. Three players – goalkeeper Santos, left-back Renan Lodi, and midfielder Matheus Henrique – were handed their debut call-ups. During the announcement, Tite defended his decision to hand former Inter Milan forward Barbosa a recall. “It’s challenging. I seek in my professional life to look at different sides of situations for everyone to win. Right now is the national team, clubs, and athletes,” explained Tite. “I saw Gabriel Barbosa’s manifestation of how proud he would be to be in the Brazilian team. “Now is the preparation period, now will come qualifying period, World Cup and America’s Cup. To form this final team, I have to give it a chance.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
