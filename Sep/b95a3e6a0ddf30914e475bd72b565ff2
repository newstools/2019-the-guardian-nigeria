Governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP) in the November 16 elections in Bayelsa State, Senator Douye Diri, has appealed to all members of the party in the state to close ranks ahead of the crucial polls. Diri, who was barely two months old in the Senate before clinching the PDP gubernatorial ticket, made the call while speaking with journalists in Abuja yesterday. Tracing his political journey to his university days when he was a students’ union activist and later organising secretary of the Ijaw National Congress (INC), he said the primary election had come and gone and appealed to other contestants to join him in the battle ahead.He specifically called on Chief Timi Alaibe, whom he said he had a close working relationship with for over 10 years, to bring his influence to bear on the final outcome of the elections in November. “I have no problem with my brother, Alaibe. I worked closely with him at the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) when he was managing director, but we parted ways when I went on to support Governor Seriake Dickson during the political campaigns in 2015 when Alaibe himself contested.“We are from the same council in Bayelsa, and I see him as my brother. I hope he feels the same way about me, politics apart,” Diri said.He similarly solicited the support of the other 18 aspirants who lost the primary to him, adding: “We are reaching out to them and other members of the party to forge a common front in the November elections. The response we are getting is good.” Reminded that the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state is a formidable force in the election, Diri said the APC could not win any ward in the state, if the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) leaves a level-playing field.
