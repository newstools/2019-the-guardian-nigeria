Italian police has cancelled a fine imposed on a Nigerian migrant for sweeping streets without permission, BBC reported. The 29-year-old man, simply identified as Monday had always put up a cardboard sign each morning with the caption in Italian “Dear ladies and gentleman, I would like to integrate myself honestly in your society without asking for alms. I will keep your street clean and ask only a contribution for my work.” Monday do get coins into his plastic cups or baseball caps gifted by passersby who appreciated his efforts. However, the local police in Mestre, a town near Venice, accused him of “flagrantly cleaning the area without council authorisation” and issued him with a €350 fine – N138,000. Subsequently, an online appeal was launched by a local lawyer, Matteo D’Angelo, to help pay the fine. D’Angelo said that punishing Monday for keeping the streets clean was absurd. On Facebook, D’Angelo said that Monday had swept up “leaves that block the drains every time it rains, cigarette butts and all the rubbish that we civilised citizens throw on the ground, and the dog s— that owners fail to clear up. “Woe betide a poor chap who tries to integrate himself,” D’Angelo added. But the fine was withdrawn after police received four phone calls from other local residents who defended Monday. Authorities said the fine had been given by officers who were new and inexperienced.
