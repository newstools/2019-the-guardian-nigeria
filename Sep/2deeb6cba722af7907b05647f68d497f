Former Nigerian footballer and coach, Samson Siasia’s mother, Ogere Siasia, has been freed 76days after she was kidnapped from her home in Bayelsa State. Mrs Siasia has been kidnapped for Ransome  before. She was abducted in November 2015 by three men on a motorbike in the same village. Mrs Siasia was released four days after the former coach said the police have been finding it difficult to track his mother’s whereabouts as they are no close to finding her. “The police said it’s been difficult to track these kidnappers, but my great concern is that my mother is very sick,” Siasia told BBC Sport. “For someone who is unwell to be held against her will is not only callous, but heartbreaking and sad. “So I can only keep appealing to these guys to please let my mother go. I would like for the government or whoever is capable to help me bring my mother back.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
