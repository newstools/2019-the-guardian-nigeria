The 36-year-old known for his fervent support of President Vladimir Putin, posted the video ahead of contentious Moscow elections on Sunday. Simply titled ‘Moscow’, Timati declares ‘I don’t go to rallies, I don’t b******t’,’ in a rebuke to the thousands who had protested to demand fair elections after opposition candidates were barred from the ballot, Mail Online reports. Further lyrics praise the Russian capital as a wealthy city that has become ‘world standard’ and ‘doesn’t hold gay parades.’ ‘I will down a burger for Sobyanin,’ the song says, referring to Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, a Putin ally who has been in charge since 2010. The mayor is detested by the opposition for refusing permission for rallies and cracking down on protesters. Moscow had gained 1.48 million dislikes when Timati took it down on Tuesday, writing on Instagram that he did not intend any offence.

Only I didn’t have such a goal.’ On the other hand, Guf posted an apologetic video assuring his fans that he was ‘used’ and “didn’t get a penny for this, I swear.” ‘I am proud of our young people who understand politics,’ he says. ‘I’m sorry that I don’t follow the political situation in the country.’ The video, which critics have suggested was a paid job ordered by the Russian government, is believed to be the 30th most disliked in YouTube history.
