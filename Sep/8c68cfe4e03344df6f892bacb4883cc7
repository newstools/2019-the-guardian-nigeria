The Delta State Government said it had mobilised to site for rehabilitation of the failed portions on the Benin-Sapele Road and Asaba-Onitsha highway on the Asaba side of River Niger Bridge within the state.The state governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, represented by his deputy, Deacon Kingsley Otuaro, disclosed this yesterday at a thanksgiving service at Christ Embassy, Airport Road, Effurun. Okowa said that with the Federal Government’s approval, contractors had immediately been drafted to the roads to carry out rehabilitation, saying that the measure was to improve intra-state movement.He also said that the state government would rehabilitate Agbor-Abraka-Eku Road, which had also been in a deplorable state. According to him, “I know that Deltans are unhappy with the deplorable state of federal roads across the state. We may not have the resources to do the road but we can do palliative work on them. After applying for permission from the Federal Government to embark on the rehabilitation of these failed roads in the state, we got approval three days ago and we have deployed contractors to commence work on the very bad spots.”He assured Deltans that he and his deputy “will continue to humble ourselves before God and Deltans because we have not come to be lord over them. We have indeed come to serve the people.” The governor further stated that there were many reasons for his administration to be thankful to God, pointing out that they were not disappointed during the campaigns and elections in spite of the challenges and intrigues which characterised the exercises.Earlier in his remarks, Otuaro re-affirmed the determination of Okowa’s administration to bequeath a “stronger Delta” to the people.In his sermon, the Pastor of the church, Eddy Owase, said thanksgiving would only be meaningful when the people establish a good relationship with God.
