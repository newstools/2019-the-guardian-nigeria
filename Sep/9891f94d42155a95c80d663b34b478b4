Ashiru and the PDP faithful had earlier trooped to the tribunal headed by Justice Ibrahim Bako in anticipation of victory, but Justice Bako struck out his petition for lack of merit and substantial evidence. Besides, APC supporters who were mobilised from different council areas of the state also stormed the tribunal as early as 6am chanting victory songs from its Taiwo Road premises to Government House, Kaduna in celebration of El-Rufai’s victory. Relatedly, the election tribunal sitting in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State yesterday sacked PDP’s House of Representatives candidate for Ikwo/Ezza South Federal Constituency and Chairman, House Committee on Reformatory Institutions, Chief Laz Ogbe.It ruled that APC’s candidate, Chinedu Ogar, won the election as he scored the highest number of valid votes in the poll and was, therefore, returned elected. Meanwhile, former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of APC, Timi Frank, has charged judges of the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal to be fearless and courageous, as they prepare to give their verdict on the petition challenging the election of President Muhammadu Buhari. In a statement in Abuja yesterday, he urged the justices not to base their ruling on sentiments, frivolities or technicalities, as the issues at stake would tremendously affect the peace, security and wellbeing of the country should they choose to rule myopically and selfishly. He said the justices that heard PDP and its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar’s petition against President Buhari’s election, could not afford to fail Nigerians by ruling based on fear, intimidation and the presidency’s overbearing influence. “They must strive to fearlessly and courageously contribute to the sustenance of the nation’s democracy, rule of law, good governance and the country’s long term peace and prosperity.“As the justices put finishing touches to their judgement, they should know that Nigerians and the whole world are waiting and watching,” he said.
