Ensure you comb your hair before shampooing to avoid your hair breaking unnecessarily. Condition Always ensure you condition your hair after shampooing. It is essential to use conditioner every time you shampoo your hair to restore moisture. It is also advisable that you leave the conditioner on the hair for some minutes before washing them off.
