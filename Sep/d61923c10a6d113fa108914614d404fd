The study was conducted by researchers at Washington State University and the University of Southern Mississippi. Around 100 undergraduates were asked to rate the Instagram profiles of 30 study volunteers. The volunteers granted researchers access to their 30 most recent posts. The posts were divided into three categories: “posies,” “selfies” and “something else.” Factors included in the ratings were: levels of self-absorption, extraversion, success, and self-esteem. Researchers found that those who posted “posies” rather than “selfies” scored more positively. Chris Barry, WSU Professor, via Insider Researchers suggests that “posies” may come across as less staged and therefore more appealing. This reality is not far-fetched to what is obtained in Nigeria where different applications are being used to edit pictures in such a way that it will appeal to a larger audience. Let us not forget, celebrities are not left out from this “Instagram likeability hustle”. A few months ago, Yemi Alade accused Tiwa Savage of editing her pictures to look fuller in certain areas. According to this research, it is better to post pictures that seem less staged as this is more appealing.
