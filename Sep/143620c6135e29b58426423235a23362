Morocco is a country located in North Africa that has a coastline on both the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It has borders with Algeria to the east and the Spanish North African territories in the north Morocco’s attractions offer an eye-opening taste of the exotic, with snake charmers and conjurers, souks piled high with hordes of treasures and endless glasses of mint tea. It’s also an adventure into some of North Africa’s most stunning scenery and these are some of the highly-rated locations in the country; The exciting and vibrant buzz of Marrakesh medina sums up Morocco for many visitors and is a major tourist attraction. The old city is entered from the vast plaza of Djemma el-Fna Square where it seems, half the city converges throughout the day and into the evening to watch the stall vendors, traditional musicians, snake charmers, and acrobats. Morocco has plenty of beautiful old town areas but Rabat’s Oudaias Kasbah neighbourhood has to be one of the country’s most picturesque. This is a peaceful and perfectly quaint district that feels miles away from the city, despite being right in the city’s core. Along with Marrakesh, Fes is Morocco’s other big cultural destination. But unlike its sister Imperial City to the south, Fes hasn’t been trussed up for the tourists. Fes el Bali (old city) is an authentic muddle of a place, where it’s easy to get lost but still worth the adventure. This golden-stoned adobe kasbah (fortress) is a fairy-tale domicile, and unsurprisingly the orange-hued turrets and curvy lanes inside have become a favourite film location for Hollywood due to the surreal beauty of the place.
