The Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) says the decision to relief Winifred Oyo-Ita of her position as Head of Service (HoS) of the Federation is a sign of President Muhammadu Buhari’s zero-tolerance for corruption. The organisation in a statement signed by its Chairman Niyi Akinsiju in Abuja on Thursday, added that the president’s decision had further demonstrated his commitment to fighting corruption. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had been investigating Mrs Oyo-Ita, over an alleged N3 billion-contract scam, abuse of duty tour allowance and money laundering, among others, during her previous position as Permanent Secretary.
