Babajide Sanwo-Olu Against the background of the Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP) claims that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s achievements in his first 100 days were less than sterling, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos described the PDP as a loser unwilling to acknowledge good when it sees one. A member of the Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC), Lagos State Chapter of the APC, Olorunfunmi Basorun, urged the residents of the state to support the administration of Sanwo-Olu in providing good governance and development. The elder statesman, in his reaction to the PDP’s claim, said: “If anybody is in doubt about what the government claimed it achieved, the facts are there for everyone to verify. For instance, the governor advertised what he did since May 29, 2019 in one of the national newspapers, which deserves commendation at least for having the courage to publish it. “His critics should rather commend him for having achieved much even with the little resources at his disposal.” He also applauded the improvement in refuse management since the governor took over on May 29, saying, “this cannot be compared to what obtained when former Governor Akinwunmi Ambode engaged a foreign company to manage refuse in Lagos. The environment was so bad that there would have been an outbreak of epidemic if not for the prompt intervention of the incumbent. He recently launched the Blue Box Programme aimed at encouraging waste sorting in a bid to achieve its goal of a cleaner Lagos devoid of filth. To me, the government’s 100 days achievements are still within the scope of pass mark.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
