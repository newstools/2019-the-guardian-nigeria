The Presidential Election Petition Tribunal Wednesday said President Muhammadu Buhari was “eminently” qualified for the 2019 presidential election. “Mr Buhari is not only qualified but is eminently qualified for the election,” chairman of the court of appeal panel said. The tribunal ruled that Buhari’s certificate from the Nigerian military is higher than the Secondary School certificate stated as a minimum academic requirement for the election in the constitution. The judge said this while reading the judgement in the petition filed by Atiku Abubakar and the Peoples Democratic Party questioning Buhari’s re-election. Mohammed said the PDP had failed to further prove otherwise. The court held that the evidence tendered regarding Buhari’s qualifications were not to be relied upon, since the PDP was not the original makers of the documents. Abubakar and the PDP had through their lead counsel, Livy Uzoukwu, among others had contended that Buhari was not qualified to have contested and that he supplied false information to the INEC.
