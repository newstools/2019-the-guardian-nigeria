BAD BOYS FOR LIFE – Official Trailer Hollywood actors, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence reunite 16 years later for the third instalment of Bad Boys. Released in 1995, the original Bad Boys was a hit buddy-cop action-comedy that made bigger names out of stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, in addition to then first-time feature director Michael Bay. The sequel, Bad Boys II was released eight years after. After an earlier iteration of the project by Smokin’ Aces and The Grey filmmaker Joe Carnahan was scrapped due to creative differences between Smith and Carnahan, “Bad Boys for Life” finally began filming at the top of this year, with Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah (Gangster) calling the shots, and Smith and Lawrence returning to their roles as Michael “Mike” Lowery and Marcus Burnett. And with its January 2020 release date about four months away now, the sequel is getting its marketing machine up and running this week. Sony had announced plans to make a Bad Boys 4 back in 2015 but has since removed the film from its release schedule and is now positioning “Bad Boys for Life” as the conclusion to their franchise (Marcus and Mike even promise one another “One last time” in the trailer). That might be for the best, considering how it’s already taken almost twenty-five years just to get two Bad Boys sequels made. “Bad Boys for Life” is scheduled to hit the cinemas next January.
