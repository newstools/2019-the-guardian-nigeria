Former Super Eagles defender, Ifeanyi Udeze believes that the home-based national team’s woeful performance against Sparrow Hawks of Togo in the Africa Nations Championship (CHAN) qualifier was as a result of the long break of the Nigerian league. He noted that the CHAN Eagles were not fit enough to contend with the Togolese, who, according to him, had been in camp for a long while. Udeze also disagreed with Coach Imama Amapakabo that Nigerian league players could not interpret match formations, arguing that the match rusty CHAN Eagles wouldn’t have been able to blend well psychologically and also be focused 100 percent for the tie after just a few days of coming together. “The CHAN Eagles have the chance to cancel the 4-1 deficit against Togo if the right things were done. “The preparation for the first leg was not good enough. People should not blame the players. Coach Imama has to work out a well-tailored plan for the return leg. “I was once a league player and I understand what it takes to play in a competitive game without being active in the league. There is a spirit that comes with it. “I still believe in Nigerian players. In the past, most Nigerian league players, including me, travelled out of the country to prove themselves. So, saying that the players cannot interpret game plans is false. All the players need is the right motivation and encouragement. “Amapakabo is my friend and I believe he can get the CHAN ticket,” he said.
