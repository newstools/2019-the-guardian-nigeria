Like Monday’s exercise, both envoys again shunned the protesters amid torrents of anti-colonial songs within the premises.Addressing the reporters at their resumed occupation of the high commissions, the president of the group, Etuk Bassey Williams, stated: “ We are giving the British and Irish governments a 21-day ultimatum to act and call the UK court, P&ID and the Irish authorities to order.“If after 21 days and nothing happens, we will come back to occupy the embassies. We will sleep here, cook here and eat here until the judgment is reversed.” The group said it embarked on the protests to send a strong message to the international community that “Nigeria is not a Banana Republic,” adding that “our request should not be taken for granted.”The marchers commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his doggedness in fighting corruption and refusal to accept the court judgment.They explained that their action was against the backdrop of an ‘attempt’ to re-colonise Nigeria, impoverish its more than 200 million people among other exploitative implications. The $9.6 billion fine translates to about N2.9 trillion, a figure in the range of the vote captured for capital expenditure in the 2019 federal budget.
