Nigerian rapper Chibuzor Nelson Azubuike, popularly called Phyno is among the few most consistent rappers in the country even though, somehow, he still is underappreciated. Last November, Phyno revealed that he will be releasing his third album sometime this year. With two solid albums under his belt, The Playmaker and No Guts No Glory, Phyno’s upcoming third body of work has made us highly anticipate its release. In order to ease the tension of anticipation, the gifted rapper announced in August the release date of the forthcoming album, which he has titled Deal With It. However, Phyno has already released two official singles, “Agu” and “The Bag” this year— both solid tracks that rely on his effortless flow. Our guess is that these commendable tracks will pop up on the forthcoming tape, alongside some more good music.  Though he started out as a producer, producing for artistes like Flavour, Timaya, Ruggedman, Bracket, 2Shotz, J Martins and Mr Raw, gave a shot at the hip-hop genre in 2010 g after moving to Lagos. In 2012, Phyno started recording songs for his debut studio album, No Guts No Glory, which didn’t drop until early 2014. The album featured guest appearances from Omawumi, Olamide, Efa, P-Square, Timaya, Flavour N’abania, Mr Raw, M.I, Ice Prince and Runtown. Most of the songs on the album were recorded in Igbo and Pidgin. Ghost Mode, which was released in September 2012, and featuring Olamide, served as the album’s lead single and topped numerous charts around the country.
