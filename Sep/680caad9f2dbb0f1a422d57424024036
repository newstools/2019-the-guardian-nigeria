 [FILE PHOTO] Abia State Governor, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu  The All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and its candidate, Dr Alex Otti had approached the tribunal to nullify the declaration of Ikpeazu of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the petitioners alleged that Ikpeazu did not win the majority of the lawful votes cast in the March 9, 2019 election.NAN reports that Otti came third while Uche Ogah, the candidate of All Progressive Congress (APC) was second in the governorship election. However, the petiotioners urged the tribunal to declare the election invalid by reasons of criminal practices, non substantial compliance with the electoral guidelines, and over voting in 788 polling units in the conduct of the election Delivering a unanimous judgment, Chairman of the panel, Justice Lekan Ogumonye dismissed the petition for the failure of the petitioners to prove their allegations beyond reasonable doubts. The tribunal held that testimonies told by 65 polling units agents who appeared as witnesses for the petitioners were not sufficient to prove allegations of over voting in 788 polling units. The tribunal held that if even there were some infractions in said polling units, they were not substantial to invalidate the entire election. The tribunal therefore held that the petitioners failed to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt and thereby dismissed it for lacking in merit. Speaking newsmen, Dr Paul Ananamba, SAN, counsel for the second respondent (Ikpeazu) described the decision as “a landmark judgement borne out of thorough scrutiny and solid analysis.”Mr Olushola Dare, counsel for the petitioners said the judgment would move the countries jurisprudence forward, but added that he will consult his client.
