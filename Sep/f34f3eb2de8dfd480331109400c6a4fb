Magu, who was represented by the Head, Kaduna Zonal Office, Mailafia Yakubu, featured in the station’s popular Hausa programme, “Rana Mudu Aiki.” Responding to his listeners, Magu cleared the air on the size of recoveries in terms of money and properties the Kaduna Zone has so far made. He further explained how the zonal office could be reached for complaints, the types of cases the Commission handles, the many facets of internet fraud and synergy between the Commission and the courts. He charged parents and guardians to monitor the activities of their children and wards, especially as trends show that youths are easy recruits for fraudulent activities. Listeners who phoned thanked and expressed support for the Commission, urging other agencies of government and Nigerians to collaborate with the EFCC in its effort to rescue the country from the grips of corruption.
