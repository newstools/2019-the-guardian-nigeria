Nigeria Stock Exchange (NSE). Photo/rainbowfm Transactions on the equity sector of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) reopened on a downward note yesterday, occasioned by price losses in most blue chip stocks, as the All Share Index (ASI) depreciated by 0.2 per cent. Specifically, at the close of transactions yesterday, the ASI decreased by 48.41 absolute points, representing a dip of 0.2 per cent to close at 27,650.28 points. Similarly, the market capitalisation lost N24 billion to close at N13.460 trillion. The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, among which are: Presco, UAC of Nigeria (UACN), Nigerian Breweries, Vitafoam Nigeria, and Dangote Cement. Analysts at Afrinvest Limited said: “We maintain our bearish stance for the market, although the current low prices of stocks pose opportunities for bargain hunting.” Also, analysts at United Capital Plc in their report for this week predicted that the decision of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) would affect investors’ sentiment towards the equity market, in conjunction with the happenings in the global space. The Chief Research Officer of Investdata Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omodion said: “Market players should maintain a cautious outlook due to the low investor confidence, liquidity and the wait for major economic triggers. Hence, we advise investors to trade cautiously in the short-term as we await positive catalysts to drive market recovery. He added: “That notwithstanding, we would not overlook the possibility of a bargain-hunting motive supporting positive performance, especially with many fundamentally sound stocks remaining under-priced. With the prices of major blue chips continuing to drop in recent weeks, we expect speculative trading to shape the market’s direction this week, despite the seeming negative outlook.” Market breadth closed negative, with 18 gainers versus 24 losers.
