The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arrested Edoboryi Osaruese Leerees, 23 year-old, a fake Jumia agent in Benin City, Edo State. Leerees was arrested following a petition by a lady who claimed to have paid him over One million naira ( N1,000,000) for the supply of good which she and her friends ordered from his page online but never got  the items. According to the lady, Leerees sent her a message on WhatsApp and told her he was an agent of Jumia and pleaded with her to help him market his products which were on sales at 40% discount. When the lady saw how attractive the prices were,  she and her two friends credited the suspectâ€™s accounts with N1,000,000 and waited for the delivery of their goods. However, days elapsed and  the goods were not forthcoming, she then went to Jumia office to make enquiry and discovered that Leerees was not an agent. She petitioned the EFCC after he refused to refund her money. Leerees modules operandi was to use his social media platforms as an agent of Jumia to advertise goods which are purportedly on promo at cheaper prices. This makes unsuspecting customers to send money into his account for goods which he never delivered. Investigations revealed that Leerees is an internet fraud suspect who has has defrauded serveral people, including foreign nationals using the names, Vin Diesel and Mark Sinclair, an American. EFCC said the suspect has made useful statement  and would be changed to court soon.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
