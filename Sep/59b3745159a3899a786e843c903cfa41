Vector Prescribes “Tetracycling” For M.I In New Diss Track Seven days after Nigerian rapper Vector and his lyrical henchmen Vader and Payper, had in a cypher delivered a torrent of verbal blows on fellow rapper M.I, the “King Kong” rapper comes back with another diss track aptly titled “Tetracycling”. In “Tetracycling” Vector assumes the role of a pharmacist who prescribes a drug “Tetracycling” for his sick patient –  M.I who is suffering from the “The Purge”. The artwork of “Tetracycling” which serves as the label comes with a warning which reads: “THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE CONSUMED ONLY AFTER BEFORE OR DURING THE PURGE EXPERIENCE” Some noteworthy lines from the track: “Mr Incredible I hear wetin you talk o, but you know lyricist on the roll is based on the bars though” “Barrack boy, yeah I know where to get a gun from and I never miss, so if you duck, I’m playing duck-hunt” M.I did not waste time in responding to the diss track. The “You Rappers Should Fix Up Your Lives” rapper took to his twitter page to make known his displeasure, not without promising a well-deserved response. “@VectorThaViper you make me feel like entering studio to respond to this bullshit is a waste of my time!!!!!  But you insulted my fans.. so I will lower myself and give you what you have deserved.. tick tock nigga”  Listen to “Tetracycling” below:
