Emmys 2019: Did The Audience Mock Kim Kardashian And Kendall Jenner?. PHOTO: CNN Of all the things that made the 71st Annual Emmys memorable, perhaps one of the most unusual moment would be an unexpected reaction from the audience when Kim Kardashian and her sister, Kendall Jenner took to the stage. The reality star sisters took to the stage to present the award for Outstanding Competition Series. “Our family knows first-hand how truly compelling television comes from real people just being themselves….” This statement elicited a row of laughter from the star-studded audience. Her sister Kendal Jenner finished the other half of the statement: “Telling their stories unfiltered and unscripted.”   Below are some of the reactions from social media users:    What Kim Kardashian alluded to in her intro was her family’s reality TV show, “Keeping Up With the Kardashians”. “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” is an American reality television series that airs on the E! cable network. The show focuses on the personal and professional lives of the Kardashian–Jenner blended family. Its premise originated with Ryan Seacrest, who also serves as an executive producer. The series debuted on October 14, 2007, and has subsequently become one of the longest-running reality television series in the country.
