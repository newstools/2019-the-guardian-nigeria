 One of the power installations in Lagos   							              PHOTO: Femi Adebesin-Kuti  The Nigerian Electricity Management Service Agency (NEMSA), an agency established by NEMSA Act 6 of 2015, to enforce technical standards and regulations, technical inspection, testing and certification of all categories of electrical installations, electricity meters and instruments, yesterday in Abuja, stressed the need for the meter deployment to be efficient, safe, reliable and sustainable. The Managing Director of the agency, Peter Ewesor, who spoke at a meeting with the DisCos and meter providers, said they would conduct test and certify the meters at the agency’s testing stations across the country. While metering had remained a critical problem in the power sector, with the DisCos failing to meet up with their targets, the sector’s regulator, Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission had introduced MAPs with the intention of bridging prevailing gap, reduce estimated billing of consumers and improve revenue collection.With the expected surge in the supply of the asset, some stakeholders had raised concern over the capacity of NEMSA to provide timely certification of the meters. Ewesor however insisted that the agency had made necessary arrangement to address prevailing challenges that could arise from the surge.“We have plans to ensure that the meters they will be bringing are ones we have adequate resources to deal with. We have three meter test stations; Oshodi is in Lagos. We have Meter Test Station in Kaduna. We have Meter Test Station in Port Harcourt. Definitely, all the MAPs and DisCos should go to the Meter Test Station close to their Environment,” he said.Stressing on the need for effective collection of revenue to address the financial crisis in the sector, Ewesor warned the service providers to avoid.
