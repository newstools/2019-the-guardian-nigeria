DJ Spinall, fondly called “The Cap” by fans and the likes has released the video for his latest single “Edi” which features Nigerian rapper Reminisce. Released under TheCapMusic, Edi which was directed by TG Omori is a song anyone will vibe to at first-listen. If you like to dance, this song is capable of making you bust some moves. As usual, Reminisce delivered his verses and chorus effortlessly in his dialect, Yoruba, which also blended perfectly with the beat. Spinall who released “Dis Love” with Wizkid and Tiwa Savage is obviously not slowing down with music releases. It appears he has a lot of unreleased songs in-store; we are ready for them!
