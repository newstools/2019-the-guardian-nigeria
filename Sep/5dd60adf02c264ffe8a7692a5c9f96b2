Good vision helps you perform well—at home, at work, or during any activity. That’s why it’s important to take a few simple steps to make sure you help keep your eyesight at its best. Here are some simple tips to help maintain eye health: Eat a Balanced Diet Your eyes are unique and have their own set of nutritional needs. As part of your healthy diet, choose foods rich in antioxidants, like Vitamins A and C; foods like leafy, green vegetables and fish.  Many foods – especially fatty fish, such as salmon – contain essential omega-3 fatty acids that are important to the health of the macula, the part of the eye responsible for central vision. Get enough sleep When you get the right hours of sleep, there is a high chance of you waking up without a burn sensation in both eyes as a result of lack of sleep or just not enough. Also, you will look great and get to perform at your best at home or work. Avoid Smoking Smoking exposes your eyes to high levels of oxidative stress. While the connection has not been clearly identified, it is known that smoking increases your risk for a variety of health conditions affecting the eye. Adjust Device Lighting Making use of digital devices for hours each day at work and at home exposes your eyes to high energy blue light which isn’t healthy. Therefore, keep your computer screen within 20 to 24 inches of your eye. Adjust lighting to minimize glare on the screen, blink frequently and take a break every 20 minutes.
