The comedian and entrepreneur, Emeka Erem, popularly known as Ajebo, last Sunday, September 1, 2019, literarily shut down the prestigious Eko Hotel with the sixth edition of his soldout show, Ajebo Unleashed. Themed What Women Want, the show, which was sponsored by Middlechase Property Ltd, saw rib-cracking comedy from some of the country’s humour merchants like, Forever, Seyilaw, MC Shakara, AY, Odogwu, Ovy Godwin, Hilarious Chinedu and a host of others as well as good music from acts such as, Davido, Spyro, T-classic, Rick Hassani and Peruzzi. Ajebo Unleashed is the first show that Davido performed his hit single with Chris Brown, having been away from the country for some months. Ajebo did justice to the theme, ‘What women want’ as he cracked hilarious jokes and celebrated women at the show. The audience had an amazing night as the fun was back to back and the event packaged with so much class. At the end of the show, the sponsors put smiles on the faces of two people as one lucky winner went home with an all-expense-paid trip to Dubai while another got a two-bedroom apartment in the highbrow area, Lekki.
