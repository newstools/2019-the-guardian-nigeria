Seyi Shay and Teyana Taylor | Photo: YouTube/Screenshot Nigerian superstar Seyi Shay has released the video for her much-anticipated Gimme Love remix featuring U.S recording artist Teyana Taylor. The song is an afrobeat inspired, rhythmic take on R&B, Seyi Shay’s exotic pop vocals lure you in, while Teyana’s gentle, sensual rasp helps create an emotive anthem for love. It is not news that Seyi Shay and Teyana Taylor have in common is their ability to pull off an impressive dance routine. It becomes evident in Seyi Shay’s dance performance in the 2018 video of Gimme Love and Teyana Taylor’s breath-taking delivery in Kanye West’s iconic 2016 video for Fade. Given their track record, it wouldn’t be far-fetched to expect a dance-off in their forthcoming video for Gimme Love. The culturally rich music video is the perfect blend of fashion and romance. Directed by Walu and produced by JM Films. The video was shot in Harlem, New York. Watch:  With this record, Seyi Shay and Teyana Taylor might be vying for the badge of best collaboration in 2019. This is because both artistes are great vocalists and because it is almost an exception to see a female U.S artist collab with an African female artist, trust the two to bring on their A-games.
