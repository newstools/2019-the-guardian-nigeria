 The bad Oke-ira Nla road  According to the residents, the situation is so bad that pregnant women sometimes lose their babies before they are rushed to the hospitals because of the big gullies on the road. “There is hardly any stretch of road inside this area that is totally free of potholes. Starting from Oke Iran junction on Ajah/Addo road to inside the area, almost the all sections of the road have massive potholes, which is terrible. The Iyaloja Tinubu model market located by this road has been deserted and has become a home for Abokis and Okada riders,” one of the landlords in the area, Engineer Stephen Emehi said. He noted that the experience navigating through the area during rainy season is terrible as vehicles break down, while heavy-duty trucks get stuck in the mud, further creating a crater on the road. Emehi added that the road is impassable. “It was supposed to be an alternative route for people who want to avoid Ajah traffic to Lagos business school on Sangotedo. We call on the state government to intervene as Oke ira nla residents groan under deplorable road situation.” Another resident, Obinna Jones, of Golden Estate Housing, recalled that the former governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, had assured that the road would be given consideration for reconstruction in his second tenure, “but unfortunately for us, he didn’t win a second term in office. Today, the situation is worst than the last time.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
