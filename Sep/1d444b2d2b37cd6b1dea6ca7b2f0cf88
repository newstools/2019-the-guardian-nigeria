President of the Sweet Boyz Association, Falz is back again to give the ladies some sweet “Loving”. This track is a love song that has a melodious chorus and body-moving beat that will leave you shaking to the beat in no time. The Willis-produced song serves as a follow up to ‘Alakori‘ featuring Dice Ailes. Shot in a village, this video perfectly portrays a party setting with its live band. At the beginning he was in search of a band with back up singers so he can entertain his lover, he later found some people willing to join his team and went on to deliver a wonderful performance. The old school themed love song also shows Falz “The Bahd Guy” portraying three different personalities, one as a lover, another as an event entertainer while the last one shows him as a refined gentleman performing the song.
