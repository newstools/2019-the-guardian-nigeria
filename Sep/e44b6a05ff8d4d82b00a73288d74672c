Zelensky’s office said both leaders were “satisfied with the result of the implementation of the agreements” on the exchange. “The presidents of the two countries also agreed to discuss in the near future the date of holding a summit within the framework of the Normandy format” which also includes France and Germany. The Kremlin said the prisoner exchange had “major significance” for the improvement of bilateral ties and that the two sides had agreed to remain in contact. Putin stressed the importance of conducting preparations for a new summit. Efforts have intensified to ease tensions between Moscow and Kiev since Zelensky’s election in April.
