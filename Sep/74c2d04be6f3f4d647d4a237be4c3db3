A post shared by  Davido Adeleke (@davidoofficial) on Sep 15, 2019 at 9:25am PDT  Davido told the story of how he met and recorded a song with Brown in a chat with Apple’s Beats 1 Ebro Darden. He says, “We have a mutual friend actually, Hoodie. I spoke to Chris in December last year on facetime for a minute. But then, we didn’t link. My friend (Hoodie) would tell me that he links this record I did last year (Assurance)… “So I come back to LA and I’m recording the album and I’m making this record (Blow My Mind) – shout-out to Shizzi and Wurld, they produced and co-wrote it too. I sent the record to the Hoodie and then I was on a flight for 12 hours to Italy. And when I landed in Italy, the verse was in my email. I ain’t speak to Chris a day in my life. I only spoke to him once… “Then he came for the tycoon fest in Atlanta… I just got to the hotel and they say, ‘Oh yeah, this is your key, Chris got you a room right by his…’ I spent three days in Atlanta with Chris, it was crazy, I lost my phone, you know how that goes… And then he (Chris) was like, ‘Yo, let’s go to LA to shoot the video.” Davido is set to marry Chioma Rowland in 2020. The Assurance singer proposed to Chioma last week Thursday on a dinner date in London, the United Kingdom.
