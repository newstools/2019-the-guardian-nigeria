 African light heavyweight boxer, Jude Iloh, wants more support for Nigerian boxing.  Ilo, who is aspiring to compete for a world title next year, said his victory at the just-concluded Lasgidi Boxing Nite Championship held in Lagos at the weekend was another platform for him to prepare well for the world title fight. He argued that if boxers were given more opportunity to engage in more boxing championships in the country, contending with top foreign boxers outside Nigeria would not be a problem. “I am happy that promoters are now interested in sponsoring boxing in Nigeria, but at this point, Nigerian boxers need more promoters. “If a boxer keeps training every day and cannot engage in competition, the boxer cannot perform well when he fights for big titles outside Nigeria. “Next year, I will be fighting for a world title. The venue and opponent would be announced next year. My experience and exposure has given me the confidence that I will win the event. Winning the Lasgidi competition is another way for me to showcase my prowess ahead of the world title fight,” he said.
