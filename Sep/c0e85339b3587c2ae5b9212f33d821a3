Call him self-vested or overly cocky, but Blaqbonez is no doubt busy affirming his claims of being “the best rapper in Africa”. “I’m sorry, other guys (including MI) are dope. But I’m the best. I listen to my music and compare to what other rappers are doing. People need to step up.” said Blaqbonez, while speaking with Guardian Life in August. The Last Time Under, which is his last mixtape before he released his debut album is reflective of his mindset stated above. The now prophetic mixtape showed he was hungry for not just fame but also, success. His LP was released in 2018 as the final instalment of 100 crowns (an imprint of Chocolate City Records) LAMB August rollout, that also included full-length albums from Loose Kaynon and AQ, MI , Blaqbonez immediately created a space despite his project competing with those of more seasoned rappers on the same label- MI Abaga’s Yung Denzel, and AQ and Loose Kaynon’s Crown. The album peaked at number one on the iTunes chart, dusting his label mates and Falz’s Moral Instruction. But Blaqbonez knows he has not achieved the highest A-list status and he is, therefore, looking to become a mainstay in street culture. With no halt in mind, the B.R.I.A crooner dropped major bars on the recently released Martell Cypher 2 alongside rappers like M.I Abaga, Loose Kaynon and A-Q. Even while the Cypher conversation is still ongoing – on whose bars were the hottest- Baqbonez has announced he has something new for his fans. Titled “Shut Up”, Blaqbonez revealed that this new track (produced by Tempoe) as well as its video (directed by TG Omori), will be released on Friday, September 20. See his tweet below:
