In a recent development, he has checked out of his in-patient rehab facility and is back home where he’s receiving intensive physical therapy, and says he’s “grateful” and “shocked” he’s alive. According to TMZ, he has a physical therapist coming to his house most days and he his doing lots of stretching and exercises with therapy bands. Though he is still in a lot of pains, however, he has been assured by his doctors that he will be back to where he was before the accident, and since he has nothing immediate on his plate work-wise, he can focus on bouncing back. The comedian and actor is happy and grateful to be back alive, according to TMZ, “He really cherishes the fact that he’s alive, and wants to make the most of it in every respect. The crash had a huge impact on him.”
