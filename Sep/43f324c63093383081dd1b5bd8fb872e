Couples Apologising is one thing that most people find difficult. Apologising is you throwing yourself at the mercy of the person you have wronged and hoping they forgive you. Forgiveness is a choice that is left for the other party, however, it also depends on how sincere you are with your apology. In a relationship, it is essential that you leave your ego and learn how to say sorry when the need arises and in the most sincere way. Below are some tips on how to apologise in a relationship: Be the bigger person Sometimes, be the bigger person in your relationship especially, when both of you are in the wrong and no one wants to apologise. This is a piece of the compromise of being in a relationship. And sometimes your partner will do the same for you. Putting things off too long just gives time for resentment and anger to build. It is okay to later discuss how your partner made you feel about the situation when you must have resolved the issue. Apologise the right way You need to drop all pride and apologise the right way, no ifs, no buts, just sincere apologies. This will go a long way to show how sincere you are. Be open about how you feel when you apologise, this will open doors to discuss your feelings and be very open to each other. Listen It is important that you listen to what your partner also has to say when it comes to your relationship. It will not be fair to just apologies without getting to know how they feel about your apology. This means tuning in, putting yourself in their shoes, and acknowledging you heard what they said. It’s not the time to interrupt or disagree. It’s just time to listen.  Let your actions speak It is not okay to just apologise and not change the way you act. Your actions should also show how sincere you are with your apologies. Your actions in this situation will speak louder than your words. If you don’t follow through, you’re not just making your partner mad, but you’ve crossed the line into violating your partner’s trust
