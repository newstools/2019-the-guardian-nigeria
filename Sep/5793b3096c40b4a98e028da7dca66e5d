Melaye in a tweet on his verified Twitter page, @dino_melaye said: “Let me state categorically that I have turned down the position of Director-General of the PDP Kogi State Governorship Campaign Council. I wish to PDP all the best. When the truth is a casualty there is chaos. Senator Dino Melaye.” It was gathered that Melaye, who traveled out of the country last Thursday, was still uncomfortable with the manner the primary election was conducted.

At a joint press conference presided over by Mohammed Adah Shaibu Tettes in the presence of the party’s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, the aspirants said: “The urgent need for intra-party cohesion and unity of purpose at this critical moment is recognised. It is for this reason that the candidacy of Engr. Musa Wada is considered worthy of undivided support as the task to rebuild Kogi starts in earnest. “ The aspirants are ldris Wada, Emmanuel Omebije, Air Vice Marshal Salifu Atawodi (retd), Princess Grace Iyeh Adejoh, Dr. Joseph Ameh Erico and Alhaji Kabiru Haruna. Others include Adebayo Adobayin Averehi, Aminu Abubakar Sulaiman, Victor Alewo Adoji and
