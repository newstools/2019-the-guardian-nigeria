So, if he had put all these into consideration and broke down what he expected from me, I would know how to handle things. But we didn’t have this kind of conversation.” “The only thing we talked about was when I had kissing scenes in some of my past movies. So, I started controlling my scenes because of my own judgements.” She further revealed that they divorced on a good note while revealing that they met for the first time in a strip club. “Everything happens for a reason. Even he and I spoke about it and we believed that we better off stay apart. But you know the funny thing? The first time my ex-husband saw me was in a strip club. He knew what he signed up for.” Watch the interview below:  We reported earlier that Ibrahim recently called out an OAP for asking her to go back to Safo rather than waste her time looking for Mr. Right. Ibrahim’s ex-boyfriend, Nigerian rapper, Iceberg Slim also recently took to social media to apologise to the actress for their messy breakup. According to him, he disrespected and cheated on her when they were together and he had to take to social media to apologise as part of his healing process. Recently Ibrahim revealed that she has a crush on international singer, Chris Brown while a guest on Linda Ikeji TV.
