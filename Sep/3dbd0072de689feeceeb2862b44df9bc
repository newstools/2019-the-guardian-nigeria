The National Assembly Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Makurdi, Benue State yesterday dismissed the petition filed by Mimi Orubibi of the All Progressives Congress (APC) against former Benue Governor Gabriel Suswam’s victory.

The petitioner also alleged that there was inflation of votes during the transmission of results by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), alleging that the figures were bloated by 4,993 votes in Katsina-Ala and Logo council areas.But the tribunal dwelled on grounds two of the petition on whether the first respondent (Suswam) was duly returned by majority of lawful votes cast during the February 23, 2019 polls. Meanwhile, Bauchi State Governor Bala Muhammed, whose election victory has been a subject of litigation at the Governorship Election Tribunal by former Governor of the state, Mohammad Abubakar, opened his defence yesterday.
