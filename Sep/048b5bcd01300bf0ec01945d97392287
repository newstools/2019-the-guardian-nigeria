The remains of former Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe, who died on September 6, arrived in his home village on Monday for a subdued farewell at a dusty sports field after a weekend state funeral with African leaders in the capital. Mugabe, who died aged 95 on a medical trip to Singapore, stayed in power for nearly four decades until a 2017 coup ended his increasingly autocratic rule. His death has left Zimbabwe deeply split over the legacy of a man once praised as an anti-colonial liberation icon, but whose regime was defined by brutal repression and economic chaos. He was given a state funeral on Saturday, but the return of Mugabe’s body to his place of birth northwest of the capital was a low-key event. The brown coffin with silver trimmings was placed under a small white tent surrounded by marquees sheltering about 1,000 people. Another 1,000 had gathered in the midday sun at a business area about 10 kilometres (six miles) from Mugabe’s homestead. Led by Mugabe's two sons -- Robert Jr and Bellarmine -- hundreds of villagers filed past the casket surrounded by wreaths of white flowers.

A young woman waved a giant poster of Mugabe’s portrait with the caption "hero". A group of women placed in front of the VIP area four clay pots and a calabash gourd, part of local funeral rites. - Bitter reactions -
Before the cortege arrived, mourners were handed shirts, scarves and other clothes bearing images of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, a former long-time ally who turned against Mugabe in his 2017 ouster. That sparked an angry response from some. One unidentified ZANU-PF ruling party official took the microphone, complaining it was not a rally. "It's wrong. This is about Mugabe," said local resident Nhamo Mashonganyika, who donned a red beret with Mugabe’s portrait on front.

That prompted protests and army pressure that eventually forced Mugabe out of power, part of a broader split in the ZANU-PF party between Mnangagwa's faction and Mugabe loyalists. Mugabe's final burial was also caught up in a dispute between his family and the government. But they finally agreed he would be buried in about 30 days in a national monument once a new mausoleum is built for him.
