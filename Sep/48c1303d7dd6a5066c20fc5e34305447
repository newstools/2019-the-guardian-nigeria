Dare with Falcons Youths and Sports Minister, Sunday Dare, has appealed to Super Falcons coach, Thomas Dennerby, to return to the country for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics qualifying campaign. The Guardian had reported on Monday that the Swedish coach had left the country unceremoniously over claims that some influential members of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) were interfering in his work. Before he abandoned the team, Dennerby was preparing the Super Falcons for a Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games qualifier against Cote d’Ivoire for which the federation invited 30 overseas and home-based players to camp. And in his absence, Falconets’ Head Coach, Christopher Danjuma, was told to take charge in the match against Cote d’Ivoire. Speaking on the imbroglio on his official social media handle, Dare said: “I have personally stepped into the matter of Thomas Dennerby, the coach of Super Falcons. I received a brief this morning and will proceed to seek a quick resolution to ensure he continues to coach Nigeria’s female team. “An hour ago, I had a constructive conversation on the telephone with Super Falcons coach Dennerby in Sweden. I have also spoken with the NFF leadership. We are working to resolve the issues in the interest of football development”. It will be recalled that the 60-year-old Dennerby has been in-charge of the Super Falcons for over 18 months and had led Nigeria to yet another African Women Nations Cup triumph last year and the round of 16 at the France 2019 Women World Cup. He left the country immediately after Nigeria’s Tokyo 2020 Olympics qualifier against Algeria at the Agege Stadium on September 3. The first leg has been slated to hold in Abidjan on October 2, while the return leg will be played in Lagos four days later.
