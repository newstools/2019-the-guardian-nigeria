The governor decried the limitation of clean water and sanitation  to a few “sections of a population.” “It is as many times worse if the affected demography are women and girls,” Sanwo-Olu said, adding that “the harsh burden of a lack of sanitation amenities falls on them on account of one thing: menstrual hygiene.” In August, Sanwo Olu flagged off a free healthcare program aimed at combating organ impairment and life-threatening ailments in children. He urged parents to utilise the opportunity to take their children for screening and treatment for medical conditions that could limit their mental and physical development. “If children lack access to good health facilities and quality medical attention, they might lose their ability and functionality,” Sanwo-olu said. “We want to help them fight ailments that can put them at a disadvantage. This is the reason the programme is essential to make sure our children live a good and fulfilling life,” he said.
