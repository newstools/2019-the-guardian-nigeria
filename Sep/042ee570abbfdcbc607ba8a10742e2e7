The Civil Society in Malaria Control, Immunisation and Nutrition (ACOMIN) has concluded plans to bring on board, a consortium of the World Bank, Islamic Bank and Afrcan development Bank (ADB) to help cover the gaps in funding the campaign against malaria in the country. The move The Guardian learned is geared towards ensuring that no child, pregnant woman or adult dies as a result of malaria in any part of the country. The Taraba State Programme Officer of ACOMIN, Wubuna Ishaku Gofwen, yesterday, at a media briefing on Global Fund Malaria Accountability and Advocacy Project in Jalingo, said for the fight to eliminate malaria in the country to succeed, significant funding needs to be dedicated towards the efforts. Gofwen who noted that state and local governments, as well as the federal authority have made pledges to increase allocation and spending on malaria, said that huge funding gaps still exist, hence the need to seek more assistance. He said ACOMIN is presently working in five out of the sixteen local government councils of the state, and will scale up the projects in other councils soon.
