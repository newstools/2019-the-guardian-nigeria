The downturn came as losses recorded by medium and large capitalised stocks, among which were Airtel Africa, Chemical and Allied Products (CAP), Cement Company of Northern Nigeria (CCNN), Dangote Cement and Unilever Nigeria, outweighed gains. Reviewing the market performance, analysts at Afrinvest Limited, said:  “In line with the trend, we expect the bearish performance to continue in the absence of any positive driver. Nevertheless, we do not rule out the possibility of bargain hunting activities driving positive performance in subsequent sessions.” However, market breadth closed positive, with 25 gainers versus 13 losers.
