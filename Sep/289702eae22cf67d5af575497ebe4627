• Experts task govt on remittances, transparency
• Seek exemptions for foods, education, primary healthcare
When the Value Added Tax (VAT) recently  increased to 7.2 per cent is implemented, it is expected to generate not less than N2 trillion into the government coffers in 2020.And going by the increasing revenue already recorded and the government’s plan to expand the VAT net, as well as expected improved remittances from corporate entities and government agencies with poor records, the target would be achieved.
 
The amount represents about 21 per cent of the N9.7 trillion of the 2020 budget proposal that would be sent to the National Assembly.While the three tiers of government may get additional revenue from the VAT pool, despite eliciting mixed reactions, the poor masses would surely be at the receiving end, particularly its effects on purchasing power, through possible inflationary pressure in the market.
 
The Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS) put the VAT pool in 2018 at N1.1 trillion, while the Federal Inland Revenue Service has already generated more than N600 billion in the first half of 2019.Going by the NBS 2018 figures, the recent increase in VAT from five percent to 7.2 percent (2.2 percent addition), representing 44 percent increase, is expected to generate additional N484 billion yearly. And by the current sharing formula, the Federal Government would get N73 billion; states, N242 billion; and councils, N170 billion.
