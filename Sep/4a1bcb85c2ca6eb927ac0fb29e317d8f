 [File] Rt. Rev. Olubunmi Akinlade. Photo/Youtube  Akinlade opined that instead of increasing the burden of Nigerians who are under the weight of economic recession, the government should concentrate on the present tax system and vigorously and violently go after tax evaders, adding that if everyone evading tax which does not preclude many so called big men, are made to do what is right and legitimate, there would be enough in the government’s coffers to execute its projects. He also added that a lot of Nigerians have been thinking of how to beat the system if the government should insist on the implementation of the seven and a half percent, premising their action on the fact that a lot of Nigerians parade the streets, making millions without paying tax. He however saluted the government’s policy on the emergence of Bank Verification Number (BVN) which makes it possible for the government to go into people’s account as this could go a long way to helping the government catch tax evaders. Akinlade noted that making every eligible tax payers sincerely cooperate with the government in the area of performing their civic duty is a better alternative to compelling Nigerians to pay seven and a half per cent tax now. He also tasked the ministers to put the interest of Nigerians before theirs. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
