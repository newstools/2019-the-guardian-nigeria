 [FILES] Calabar  The facility, which was commissioned and handed over to the Calabar South local government area at the weekend, was one of the club’s six areas of intervention in humanitarian services. President of the club, Rtn. Glory Ebenso said the intervention came as a request of over 33 years of not having a toilet in the market and park. She said the project was the first of its kind after the one at Main Avenue two years ago was also donated to the local government. Ebenso said despite the state’s recent celebration of being open defecation-free, places like Etim Edem park, in the heart of Calabar, is infamous for its open defecation for over 33 years. She said: “Some of the six area of focus in Rotary intervention are water, sanitation, disease prevention, and conflict resolution. For over 33 years in this town, there has never been any toilet. The people here defecate in the open. So, we felt this is another critical project for us to intervene.” Welcoming the gesture, head of the council, Calabar South, Mrs. Christiana Enemi, thanked the Rotary club for always coming to their recue anytime they are called upon to intervene in any project that concerns the people. She promised that the council would see to it that the facility is well maintained. On his part, chairman of the market and park, Elder Umor Akpan, said they are delighted for the gift given to them and promised that a committee would be set up immediately to handle the maintenance of the facility.
