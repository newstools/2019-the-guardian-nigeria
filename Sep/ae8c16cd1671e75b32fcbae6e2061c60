 Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo.<br />Photo/Twitter/SeyiAMakinde  The institution, jointly owned by Oyo and Osun States has been enmeshed in crisis over inadequate funding.But Makinde who promised to restore the institution’s lost glory said something has to be done to a marriage that is not working.Receiving members of the institution’s governing council led by its chairman and Pro-Chancellor, Prof. Oladipo Afolabi in his office, Makinde said in resolving the protracted crisis in the school, he would not mind a divorce with Osun State. “LAUTECH to Oyo and Ogbomoso land is an industry and institution we can’t toil with it. During the electioneering campaign, I spent some time in Ogbomoso; I met some teachers and students.  The situation in the school has set some students back.“I spoke with Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State when we had the security summit and I told him that I don’t mind a divorce between the owner-states as far as LAUTECH is concerned. The school used to the best state university in this whole country.  If the marriage is not working something has to be done about it especially if the marriage has produced several children who are looking forward to the parents to do what is right for their sake.” “LAUTECH is a problem that I really want solved. It is a campaign issue. I want to confront the challenge. I commit myself to finding lasting solution to the issue of LAUTECH and both Osun and Oyo Ststes will be better for it”, Makinde said.The chairman of council, Prof. Oladipo Afolabi lamented the poor funding of the institution and called for lasting solutions.
