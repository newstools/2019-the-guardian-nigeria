However, some aspirants, their supporters, and delegates have accused the party of plots to impose a particular candidate on the people. Two of the aspirants who spoke to newsmen at the venue of the primary, Alhaji Tajudeen Gidado, and Tosin Aluko, accused the leadership of being undemocratic, warning that they would resist any form of candidate imposition. In her reaction, Mrs. Aluko said: “I just heard it that the election has been postponed. I don’t want to believe it because Governor Kayode Fayemi issued a statement last week that there would be a primary election and there won’t be an imposition.” One of the delegates, Mr. Adeyeye Kayode said, “We don’t know why they are postponing the election. The candidates and delegates are here and everywhere are peaceful.” An Agent to one of the aspirants, Babatunde Adesanmi said: “as far as we are concerned, we are not aware, you are just telling us.  You people can see that the atmosphere here is conducive for any election.
