 NUPENG office  Arguing that the unions are direct victims of kidnappings, killings, and assassinations, which have put the lives of their members and the general public in grave danger, the oil workers drew the attention of top security agencies to the rot in their organisations, begging them to address the menace by fishing out the bad eggs within the fold for national interest. The oil workers also urged government and security agencies to up their ante by stemming the tide of insecurity and other emerging crimes to protect and stabilise the nation’s socio-economic and political interests. The groups under the aegis of NUPENGASSAN, which made the call yesterday in Lagos, alleged that some politicians and political officeholders are contributing to the security challenges bedeviling the nation due to their desperate bid for power, which gives rise to the proliferation of guns and creation of armed thugs across the country. President of PENGASSAN, Ndukaku Ohaeri and his NUPENG counterpart, Williams Akporeha, noted that the unfortunate situation has caused unprecedented loss of faith and confidence in the nation, which has given room for calls for alternative lines of action that are irresponsible and unpatriotic by some parochial and selfish interest groups. The unions, which said it was expedient to urgently alert the Federal Government on the grave dangers that the situation poses to the country’s image and multiplying impacts on the livelihood of Nigerians, also expressed dismay at the loss of control over activities of bandits in the country. They said: “We are deeply dumbfounded by the boldness and brazen manner in which these bandits carry out their nefarious activities ranging from intimidation, bombing, suicide attacks and killing of security agents, among others. “These nefarious acts have put Nigeria amongst the ignoble terrorist countries of the world, with serious implications for much desired national development and growth. “We should have security agencies that the people can trust to offer useful intelligence reports and our security officers are properly trained, equipped and motivated enough to act on such information to smash these criminal gangs before they strike.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
