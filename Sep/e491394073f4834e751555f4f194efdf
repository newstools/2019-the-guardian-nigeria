 President, LCCI, Babatunde Ruwase  “There are numerous potentials yet untapped.  What is critical are the enablers. We need the right mix of policies to achieve the desired outcomes.  I am aware that some policy choices have been made by the present administration to promote economic diversification, stabilize the foreign exchange market and promote small businesses”.He said evidently, there is still some work to be done, urging the need for regular engagements and communication on policy issues to ensure quality feedback and enrich the policymaking process.
 
He recommended that the engagements should cover macroeconomic policies, sectoral policies.“These will include foreign exchange policy, Trade policy, Tax policy, Energy policy, transport policy, Industrial policy, Agricultural policy, ICT policy, among others.  Some of these are cross-cutting, while others are sector-specific.  The message is that regular engagement with relevant stakeholders in the various sectors will bring a lot of value,” he stressed. The LCCI boss stated that multiple taxations remain an issue with many companies, saying that there are also issues of multiple levies and fees by government agencies at the federal, state and local government level. He lamented over the announcement increase in VAT from 5 per cent to 7.5 per cent, warning that it would no doubt put additional pressure on businesses because consumer purchasing power is already weak.On the closure of the land borders, Ruwase said the move by the federal government has enormous implications for cross border economic activities around the country.  We will continue to engage the LCCI and the organised private sector to come up with policies to encourage investment and improving the ease of doing business in the country.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
