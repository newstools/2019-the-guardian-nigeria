Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen, has promised to defend the course of the gender for national development. Describing her appointment as divine, the former deputy governor of Plateau state maintained that she never lobbied for the post. Tallen, who rejected an ambassadorial offer during President Muhammadu Buhari’s first tenure, spoke at the weekend in Jos. She pledged to give attention to violence against women and girl child education, noting: “when you empower the girl child, you have empowered a nation.” The minister advised women aspiring for political offices in 2023 to begin work now, as that was the only way they could win the confidence of the people.
