A 32-year-old graduate of The Polytechnic, Ibadan, Oyo State, and member of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Ketu, Lagos State, Omobowale Bright, is battling with kidney failure and seeks help from well-meaning Nigerians for a transplant that would cost N8 million. Bright’s medical treatment started from Ajeromi General Hospital before he was referred to Gbagada General Hospital where he was admitted for two weeks. Due to financial constraint, he goes to the hospital for medical check-up from home. He said the N8 million would cover surgery, anti-rejection drugs induction and maintenance fee, among others. He said: “my mother has agreed to donate her kidney. I am appealing to well-meaning Nigerians because this health challenge is about to take my life. I have been told that my kidneys are very bad and my case is critical. I have to undergo a kidney transplant. Please save me.” According to the medical report from Gbagada General Hospital, signed by Dr. A.A. Busari, it was stated, “after thorough clinical and biochemical evaluation, he (Bright) was diagnosed with Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease likely End stage Renal Disease Secondary to Severe Hypertension. He is currently being managed on twice weekly dialysis, antihypertensive, hematinic and calcium supplement.
