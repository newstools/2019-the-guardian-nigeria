L-R; K Brule, Khloe in the Big Brother Naija 2018 house | Photo: All Africa Big Brother Naija 2018 housemate, Khloe, has taken to her Instagram account to write a lengthy letter to Big Brother Nigeria recounting her experience and seeking answers. “Dear BIG BROTHER NIGERIA for over a year now I kept asking myself what happened that day me and my sweet @k.brule was disqualified and I still can’t get a perfect answer but yah all claim it’s big brother rules BUT even in my season a lot more happened that’s 100 times worse than that night but nothing was done, Now this season, things has been happening and nothing was done as well.” With all the ongoing drama – heated arguments, subtle fist fights, in the recent TV reality show tagged “Pepper dem”, it leaves many wondering if Big Brother actually follows his book of rules. Bearing this in mind, Khloe says, “I just want to know what This show really stand for now cos I can show what I signed, what it says and the rules BUT yah all will say “ it’s big brother house and his rules “ lol”. Khloe also stated that the reason most of the fights in the recent house have not be tamed strictly is because of “clout… voting money”.
She also went on to apologize to fellow housemate K Brule who was also disqualified saying: On this day I wanna say @k.brule I’m sorry I allowed us to be a scapegoat and I love you with all my heart  pls forgive me Khloe concluded her lengthy post saying: I know a lot of people will testify to me always saying “it’s a reality show and that means showing your real self” but that would have been justified if I wasn’t disqualified for things that was later done”even more “ and no action was taken…
 Let no one come with the “ you were voted back “ we all know what that was for and what was achieved @antolecky sorry I tried to say it’s fair on us even though I knew it’s called “Used”
 Let me stop writing before I spill the tea #DropPen
