Corn Corn is one of the favourite snack for so many, it is easy to chew on the go and also satisfying. It could be roasted or boiled, depending on how you want it. Most people convert it to its flour form and use it for other delicacies such as “Banku”. It can even be cooked together with beans. However, too much intake of corn has some dangerous side effects and they are below: Vitamins deficiency If you consume corn in high amounts, there is a very high risk of pellagra. Pellagra is nothing but a deficiency of vitamins, especially niacin in the body. Corn is deficient in amino acids (lysine and tryptophan) and niacin, which helps to protect the body from pellagra. If corn forms the major chunk of your diet, then make sure that you supplement your diet with vitamin-rich foods to prevent pellagra.
