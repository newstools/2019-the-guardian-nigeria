Have you been waiting on Wizkid to drop the ‘Ghetto Love‘ single he teased a few days ago? Wait no more because the song is finally here. Expected to be on his fourth studio album titled Made in Lagos, ‘Ghetto Love’ is a dancehall-infused song crafted in the mould of a lot of Wizkid’s songs. He sings about unrequited love from ‘Adanma’. Still, Wizkid wants to ‘die there,’ as we say in Nigeria. Starboy sticks to his winning formula on the song – relatively short length, infectious beat that can appeal to the street, club and office groove, and it sounds like a few other ones he has jumped on in the past. But Wizkid fans will never mind because ‘Ghetto Love’ still slaps afresh. The three-minute-long song is produced by Killertunes and Kel P and it is available on iTunes.  The Made in Lagos album, a tribute to his Lagos roots, maybe dropped before his Starboy Fest concerts holding in Manchester, London and Paris in October. The album may feature artists such as Burna Boy, Teni the Entertainer, Damian Marley and Chinko Ekun.
