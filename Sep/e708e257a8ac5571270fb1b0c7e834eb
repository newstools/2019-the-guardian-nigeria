Firm Trains Young Technicians
Youths Vanguard in Nasarawa State has demanded all-inclusive governance in the state, just as it urged the Governor, Abdullahi Sule to nominate a youth as a commissioner in his cabinet.
 
The youths, numbering over 100, trooped out to mark this year’s 2019 Global Peace Day with the theme “Climate Action for Peace,” an event organized, yesterday by ActionAid in Lafia, Nasarawa State capital.
 
Representative of ActionAid Nigeria and Youth Vanguard in Nasarawa, Anietcus Akapau, said one of the reasons for youths’ restiveness is marginalisation and lack of economic empowerment.
 
Country Director, ActionAid Nigeria, Ene Obi, called on the government to as a matter of urgency make the girl-child education a priority in the state. While urging youths in the state to shun violent extremism, adding that, “it must be a priority for us to shun every art of violent extremism if we must enjoy the peace we celebrate today.” Meanwhile, to empower the youthful population through skills acquisition, a firm, Panasonic Middle East & Africa Division along with its Nigeria’s partner, Panaserv Nigeria Limited, recently organised a special training programme in Lagos and Enugu for its technical staff, channel partners and freelance technicians and engineers on air conditioners installation and repairs. He said the training would deepen the pool of well-trained technicians that would not only assist the company in offering after-sale services to its customers but also help bridge technical skills gap in Nigeria.
