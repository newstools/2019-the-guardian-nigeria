Speaking during the CBN Digital Transformation training for its staff, Ojeikere said the Apex bank was done in collaboration with the Reliance InfoSystems Ltd., Microsoft’s Tier1 Partner in West Africa. He said: “The CBN has recognised the need to adopt an internal culture and operations to meet present-day reality. The goal of this cultural change is hinged on the four pillars of digital transformation, which include empowering employees, re-imagining work and productivity.” Ojeikere added that the training would also help identify transformational opportunities to support CBN’s corporate objectives, engage customers using digital tools and services, optimise operations, improve service delivery by facilitating collaboration within teams, and transform its products. Also, Managing Director, Reliance Infosystems, Olayemi Popoola lauded the apex bank for the collaboration. He said, “even with the best practices templates, no external consultant can perfectly pinpoint and successfully drive digital transformation opportunities within an organisation”. Popoola added that such training would help the firm employees harness the transformation wheels and identify opportunities in the course of their daily routines and interactions.
