The Baale of Cardoso area of Ipaja, a Lagos suburb, Chief Moroof Owonla, a.k.a. Kaka, yesterday said he was not involved in land grabbing activities within Ayobo-Ipaja Local Council Development Area following protest by some residents of Ayobo that the traditional ruler was terrorizing the community. A statement issued by his media adviser, Chief Babajide Osokoya, described Owonla as a consummate businessman in various sectors of the economy. The statement reads: “Apart from being a traditional ruler of repute, High Chief Owonla sits comfortably on successful businesses spanning hospitality, education, property, oil and gas and automobiles. “It was however shocking that some residents in Ayobo and other communities in the area staged a demonstration to protest against activities of land grabbers allegedly led by one Moroof Owonla aka Kaka who has been terrorizing their communities”. Owonla said he had no personal or business relationship with the property agent who issued a 14-day ultimatum dated September 10, to property owners in the community. He urged concerned authorities to carry out thorough investigations on the matter with a view to ascertaining those responsible for the controversial notice. “For purpose of clarity, Owonla was the property agent of late Chief Arimiyau Bello Ekundayo when he won the case over the property in suit No. ID/1722/92 in the judgment delivered by Justice O.A Williams (Mrs) of Ikeja High Court 7 on October 24, 2004 and he successfully managed the property until this year when the children of late Arimiyau Ekundayo decided to disengage Owonla and appointed Gabfob Properties Investments as their new land agent.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
