 Lanre Olusola  So why must you need to memorize the 12 times table when you have a calculator, or when you can ask Google or Siri to give you the answer to 12 x 2400?
Learning, education or knowledge acquisition today is now on-demand as you need it and on-the-go, so why place so much emphasis on going to traditional and very expensive schools like Harvard, Yale, Oxford, etc. The way we are learning today will drastically change tomorrow as people are no longer learning to acquire and store knowledge, but for skill and application in real-time on the go. Application and soft skills are the new currencies. The beauty of these new currencies is that traditional old educational models – where we are merely taught in classrooms, instructions to watch videos, listen to audios, read, cram and then be made to take tests and exams – will no longer be relevant. We have to transition towards new digital learning models. The world as we knew it decades ago has changed drastically for digital and technological reasons; Google is number 1 information and knowledge provider and learning platform in the world and it’s FREE. In case you don’t know Google is the world’s Number 1 and ONLY COMBINED Nursery, Primary, Secondary and Tertiary INSTITUTION providing EDUCATION to the world for FREE. Facebook is the world’s biggest online community with 1.59 billion daily active users. As of September 2018, the Facebook ‘Like’ button has been pressed 1.1 trillion times.  Facebook now owns Instagram and WhatsApp and on combined average, more than 2.1 billion people now use Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger every day, accounting for approximately one-third of the world’s population, over 3.2 Billion people that is about 50 per cent of the world’s population are connected via the internet globally.Today, you can learn anything; get degrees up to PhD level without visiting the four walls of a physical classroom via the Internet. So how will the 4th revolution affect our learning, work and lives?
According to an IDC (2015) report, there were over 1.3 billion people working remotely (i.e. mobile workers). The world’s demand for remote services and solutions will keep increasing and the skills required to deliver excellent work via these digital and mobile platforms will change drastically over time. Currently, there are digital accounting softwares – so who will need a physical accountant or auditor in the future? AI AutoCAD can design your home for you in 3D – So who needs a civil engineer or architect once you have your dimensions and an idea of what kind of house you want to build? This means that specific jobs and roles will go extinct and other new jobs and roles we never heard about before will be in very high demand soon. For example, there is now a serious demand for data analysts, mathematics and computer scientists, specialized salespeople with skills in online, social media and digital sales and marketing, product designers, project managers, organizational HR specialist, psychologists, life coaches, career coaches, executive/leadership coaches, relationship coaches, diversity and creativity coaches, fitness coaches, technology and digital lawyers, digital intellectual property lawyers, online TV and digital content creators, software developers, mobile app and website developers, online brand influencers, drone operators and pilots. So, be very careful what you insist your children study in those expensive traditional universities that you insist they attend because by the time they graduate, those jobs may not be relevant anymore. Below are some jobs and their alternative replacements

Currently, the rapid adoption of 4G+ and 5G things will be done faster, better and more effortlessly in real-time and from your smartphone i.e. from the convenience of your home and car. Learning will seize to be just about formal education, but about experiential and practical learning, skills acquisition and coaching in real-time. Smartphone technology and broadband speeds will change the face of how we work, play, interact, learn, relate with each other, access information and live our lives. Over 50 per cent of today’s aging workforce will require upskilling or reskilling if they want to stay relevant and gainfully employed because the millennial and next generation who are born into this revolution, do it easier, more natural, seamlessly and effortlessly. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machines are going to take about 50 per cent of traditional jobs and they will be much cheaper and more efficient. AI, digitalization and technology will be the best-friend of future business owners, because at the end of the day businesses are set up to meet the needs of customers through excellent service, on the other hand, they also want to save cost and make more money so they can deliver more value to their shareholders. Human resource personnel and talent managers need to wake up to the reality of what’s coming and begin to develop strategies across businesses, governments and training/coaching providers to maximize the available opportunities for capitalizing on the transformational trends of the 4th Digital and Technological Industrial Revolution.
