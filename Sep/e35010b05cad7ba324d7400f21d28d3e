The author, Egbujiobi, said she was inspired by her personal experiences while going about her programmes and empowerment schemes in the Congo, which earned her the recognition and award by the UN and Nigerian Air Force. “I was inspired after being nominated by the United Nations to serve in Congo as a military observer,” Egbujiobi recalled. “While serving in the Congo, I set up and ran many empowerment programmes for the natives in the communities where I served as a delegate. It was while in the course of discharging duties it dawned on me that the best way to build a safer community was if we – the military and civilians – worked together.” According to Amara Chimeka, CEO of Purple Shelves publishers, “we are pleased to be associated with a work that is definitely timely and relevant in these days of uncertainty due to insecurity.” She added, “we hope that members of the civil society, individuals and the general public, will read the book and be equipped with adequate knowledge on how to collaborate with the military and make our society safer.”Egbujiobi, a lawyer, a professional negotiator, mediator, conflict resolutionist and motivational speaker,  is married to Engineer Declan Egbujiobi.
