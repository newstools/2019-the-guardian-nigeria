Grammy award-winning rapper, Cardi B is talking candidly about her sexual assault experience and the #MeToo movement on Untold Stories of Hip Hop set to air Thursday, September 26. In the clip from People, the rapper opens up to host Angie Martinez about the time she was sexually assaulted while on the set of a magazine shoot. “I will never forget how I went to shoot for this magazine and the photographer, he was trying to get close to me like, ‘Yeah, you want to get in this magazine?’ Then he pulled his d*ck out.” Known to be very vocal with her emotions, Cardi B tells a visibly shocked Martinez exactly how she felt about the situation. “I was so f*cking mad,” she says, “and I was just like, ‘This is crazy.’” Cardi B ultimately left the shoot because of the incident. In the interview,  she goes on to describe how that experience shaped her relationship with the #MeToo movement and how pervasive sexual assault is in the music industry. “When I see the #MeToo movement — there’s girls from the hood I know that went through the same type of treatment, like they make you feel like you got to do a certain type of thing for the most bullshit shit. It happens, really, every day.” If you ever wondered if the controversial artiste had such cases to deal with it, you can rest easy now. Cardi B further went on to make it exceedingly clear that she still has a zero-tolerance policy for that kind of behaviour. When Martinez asked if she faces that same type of harassment today, Cardi said, “Oh, hell no. I’ll put you on blast on my Instagram … Okurr?
