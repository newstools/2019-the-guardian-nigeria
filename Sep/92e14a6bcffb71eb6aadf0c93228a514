Akwa Ibom state governor, Udom Emmanuel, has condemned the recent invasion and damage of facilities at the Nigeria Television Authority, NTA, Channel 12 Uyo, by rampaging commercial motorcyclists following a restriction on their operations in some parts of the Uyo metropolis. He condemned this act yesterday after inspecting the vandalised areas at the station’s operational office along Aka Etinan road, Uyo. Speaking shortly after his assessment of the administrative block, security post and station vehicle torched by the motorcyclists, the governor decried the resort to willful destruction and vandalization of property by the hoodlums who went as far as disrupting operations at the station, causing staff to sustain injuries in a bid to escape them. The governor said that he decided to visit the broadcasting outfit to identify with the management on the sad incidence and described NTA as partners in progress, saying that a team of engineers would carryout assessment of the destroyed property with a view to evolving measures of ameliorating the effect on the staff and management. It would be recalled that on Tuesday, some irate motorcyclists took to the streets of Aka Etinan, Mbierebe junction and GoodLuck Jonathan Boulevard, making bonfire from tires, brandishing dangerous weapons and dispossessing unsuspecting members of the public and justified their lawlessness on protesting the ban on their operations in some routes within the state capital.
