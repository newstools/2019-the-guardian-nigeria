Falana Falana’s Chapter One Tour kicked off in style on the 16th of August at Terra Kulture, Victoria Island, Lagos and will conclude in grandeur at the NAF CENTRE in Abuja on the 6th of September 2019. The momentum gathered at the opening show in Lagos drove her to deliver inspired performances in Accra and Kigali, respectively. The West and East African residents in both cities were astounded by her embodiment of Alternative Soul music along with her ability to combine classic covers with an Afrobeat infusion; delivering performances as pure as she did. The anticipation for Falana in the capital of Nigeria is palpable as this is no ordinary concert. Opening the show will be upcoming artistes: Jessica Bongo and Blessing Tegban. Falana will be performing with her newly curated band, giving the audience that fresh and different sound music lovers in the capital have been thirsting for. To further add a personality to the show, Falana’s singular intention of leaving no one untouched by adding little pockets of comedy while she performs is incredibly brilliant and thus, makes The Chapter One concert in Abuja one you absolutely mustn’t miss. Ending the tour in the capital of Nigeria, her home country, is a fitting finale for this growing global sensation.
