• Nine escape death in trailer crash with Okada, Micra cab in Ibadan
Six persons were yesterday injured after two Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) buses collided in Asolo bus stop, Majidun, Ikorodu, Lagos State. The incident happened at about 7:00a.m., leading to traffic gridlock in the area. This is coming barely a week after a major accident claimed three lives with many injured in the same axis. The six injured persons were taken to the hospital and later discharged yesterday. It was gathered that a motorcycle plying the BRT lane caused the accident. Officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), the police, Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) and the Lagos Neighborhood Safety Corps (LNSC) were among early respondents at the scene. An eyewitness, who simply identified himself as Rafiu, said: “The two BRT buses involved in the accident were on the BRT corridor. One was coming from Mile 12 and the other from Ikorodu. The accident happened while the BRT coming from Mile 12 moved from hitting a commercial motorcycle that was on his lane. His BRT ran into the other incoming BRT, leading to the accident.” He said the motorcycle rider fled the scene immediately, while the two male bus drivers were seriously injured. The other injured persons were women. Another eyewitness named Mama Tolu, said: “The collision left the two drivers of the buses in critical condition. It could have been worse if not for the prompt arrival of the Lagos emergency officials. All victims were taken to a nearby public health facility.” The accident triggered a long line of gridlock that affected many residents streaming from Ikorodu and surrounding neighbourhoods into downtown Lagos to resume work yesterday after the weekend. Managing Director, Primero Transport Services Limited, Mr. Fola Tinubu, said the accident was caused by commercial motorcyclists on the BRT lane. According to him, one of the BRT buses was trying to avoid a commercial motorcycle rider who was on the BRT lane, but in the process ran into another BRT bus on the opposite direction. He noted that something needs to be done about commercial motorcycle riders on the BRT lane. “The way they drive on the lane is too dangerous and I don’t know if they have another life. Thank God it was only minor injuries they all sustained. Government must enforce it that they should stop plying on BRT lane, it must be enforced and they must be serious about it because this is about life,” he said. Meanwhile, nine persons narrowly escaped death yesterday after a fuel-laden articulated truck crushed a motorcycle and a Micra taxi in Ibadan along the University of Ibadan-Ojoo expressway close to the venue of the South West Security Summit held at the institute’s conference centre. The motorcyclist and his two passengers had little bruises, same as the passengers and driver of the Toyota Micra taxi. The driver of the truck said he was suddenly stopped while on motion by a police officer. Some eyewitnesses at the scene blamed the police officer for the incident.
