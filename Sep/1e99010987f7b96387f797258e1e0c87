Kevin Hart And Montia Sabbag. PHOTO: TMZ Following his recent release from the hospital, Kevin Hart’s former sex-tape partner, Montia Sabbag is suing him for $60 million. Sabbag claims in a new lawsuit, obtained by TMZ, that her 2017 encounter with Hart in a Vegas hotel room was all planned by Hart and JT Jackson. She says Hart was motivated by publicity, especially with an upcoming comedy tour which was why he and JT allegedly hid the camera. The suit claims Hart allowed Jackson into the Cosmopolitan Hotel suite so he could set up hidden video recording devices to capture the liaison. Jackson was later charged with 2 counts of extortion relating to alleged efforts to get money out of Hart to keep the tape under wraps. Jackson denied ever extorting the comedian. Hart has repeatedly denied having any knowledge of the recording. He claimed that he, too, was a victim of Jackson’s extortion attempts. However, Hart later apologized for his infidelity and was adamant nobody should profit off his mistake. Sabbag is suing for intentional infliction of emotional distress and invasion of privacy. This is coming a few days after Hart was discharged from the hospital where he had undergone surgery for injuries he sustained from a car accident.
