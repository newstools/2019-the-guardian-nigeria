 [FILES] President of Nigeria’s Scrabble Federation Suleiman Gora (Photo credit should read PIUS UTOMI EKPEI/AFP/Getty Images)  Although Gora and his family were not harmed during the incident, the robbers took away their valuable properties. Despite the incident, however, the NSF says it is unshaken in its resolve to travel to India to defend the WESPAC title. But it needs help. Yesterday, the NSF once again pleaded with the Federal Government and corporate Nigeria to support the team’s quest for glory in Goa, India next month. The NSF said Team Nigeria must attend this year’s championship if it desired to maintain its pedigree in the sport. National Scrabble coach, Tony Ikolo said, “The federation is still pleading for support and sponsorship for Team Nigeria to be in India next month. If the federation did not get the support needed for the event early enough, Nigeria may not have any representative in India. “We are the number one scrabble-playing nation in the world, according to the present rankings. The Nigerian team cannot afford to miss the WESPAC this year.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
