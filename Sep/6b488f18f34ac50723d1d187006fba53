FUOYE Ekiti to conduct local council polls December 7
The management of the Federal University Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE) has proscribed the students union and shut down the university indefinitely. The decision followed Tuesday’s attack on the convoy of the wife of Ekiti State Governor, Mrs. Bisi Fayemi, who narrowly escaped being hurt by the protesting students of the university. The wife of the governor was in Oye Local Council in continuation of her advocacy programme when the irate students attacked her convoy. However, in a statement made available to newsmen in Ado-Ekiti yesterday, the management said it held an emergency meeting where it discussed and reviewed the unruly behaviour of the students. It said such behaviour, which included the destruction of vehicles and burning of a police van, as well as threat to lives, had compelled the university management to shut down the university. “We hereby condemn the violence that followed the protest by the students of FUOYE to register their pleasure on the epileptic power supply from Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC) to the communities of Oye and Ikole. “In view of the foregoing, management at an emergency meeting discussed and reviewed the unruly behaviour of the students. Such behaviour has compelled the university management to take the following decisions:
•”The university is hereby shut down with immediate effect.
•”Students are therefore ordered to vacate the university premises on or before, Wednesday, September 11, 2019.
•”The students union is hereby proscribed,” the statement said. Meanwhile, Chairman of the Ekiti State Independent Electoral Commission (EKSIEC), Justice Jide Aladejana, yesterday said the state would conduct the local council elections on December 7, 2019. Aladejana, who spoke with journalists in Ado-Ekiti, said that the polls would be transparent and devoid of rigging. He, therefore, appealed to the opposition not to boycott the polls.
