Nigerian media personality, Oladotun Ojuolape Kayode better known as Do2dtun like Adesua Etomi-Wellington and some other celebrities has also reacted to the incessant killings of Nigerians in xenophobic attacks in South Africa. The presenter and hypeman took to his social media page to say that the development South Africans have is their biggest undoing because they only have infrastructure without building their minds. The 35-year-old Cool FM Oon-air-personality is of the opinion that the black South Africans have tested their strength with white South Africans (Afrikaans) who control their economy but decided to take out their hate and aggression on other people especially Nigerians since they can’t do anything to the Afrikaans. Sharing the image to condemn the killings and attacks, he captioned it, <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1010010 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/do2dtun.png" alt="" width="1280" height="1297" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/do2dtun.png 769w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/do2dtun-590x598.png 590w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/do2dtun-100x100.png 100w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/do2dtun-487x493.png 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/do2dtun-237x240.png 237w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/do2dtun-474x480.png 474w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/do2dtun-592x600.png 592w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> “#FactsOnly This is how a typical “Myopic South African” thinks.. do we all believe @tayofaniran now… They are still at war with their souls.. Unforgiven and they never see the good in others. My heart goes out to Nigerians there.” The attacks on Nigerians in South Africa has been going on for a while now and although world leaders, as well as prominent personalities, have constantly condemned the attacks, the killings continue. Just recently, a video surfaced on social media of a Nigerian man being burnt alive sparking outrage from social media users. Many Nigerians have since been condemning the ‘inactions’ of the Nigerian government in taking speedy actions to curb the killings while the South African government has not also been spared from criticisms. Many aggrieved persons have accused the government of being complacent towards the attacks and killings. After pioneering a dance group called Xtreme dancers while in the University and featuring in music videos like D’banj’s ‘Why Me’ and ‘Same Ni’ by Dj Zeez, Do2dtun came to wider prominence as a TV and radio personality, hosting shows and concerts.
