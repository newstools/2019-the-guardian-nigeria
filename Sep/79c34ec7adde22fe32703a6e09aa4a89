 Youth and Sports Minister, Sunday Dare  At the parley, the minister assured the NFF of non-interference in the ongoing anti-graft agencies investigation on some of its board members. Dare noted that the mention of corruption around the football house and its seeming lack of seriousness is hurting the sport. He added that beyond the football governing body cleaning up its acts, “NFF needs to be more transparent in the way it conducts its affairs. “The perception is that the NFF is corrupt. The perception is that of unseriousness; this perception is hurting the sport. “We need to reset the perception, the charge of corruption and other negative things can be turned around by embracing transparency. “The executive board (of NFF) should learn to do things differently, the minister will not interfere with EFCC or ICPC since it is important to allow these organisations follow their own due processes. We must allow them to do their work,” Dare stated. NFF President, Amaju Pinnick, with some other board members, had lamented the ongoing investigation of some of them by anti-graft agencies, saying they now “feel unsafe”.Pinnick promised that the football body would henceforth provide updates to the minister by sending him memos “for every fund received” as proof of the federation’s commitment to the prescribed era of transparency.
