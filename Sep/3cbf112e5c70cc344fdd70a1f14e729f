Governor Babagana Umara of Borno State has earmarked N3 billion for the rehabilitation of Maiduguri-Gwoza road. The 39-year-old road covers 135 kilometres, linking six border communities of Pulka, Banki, Kirawa, Asghashiya, Limankara and Ngoshe. Director of Press to Government House, Pindar Sawa, stated on Saturday in Maiduguri that the disclosure was made when Umara visited the Emir of Gwoza, Alhaji Mohammed Timta, in his familiarisation tour of nine councils. He said the project would be completed to link the state capital with southern Borno and six border communities with Adamawa state and Cameroon. His words: “The rehabilitation of this road will also ease the movement of goods and services to markets and communities.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
