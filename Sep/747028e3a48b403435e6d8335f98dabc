China is preparing for a highly-choreographed anniversary celebration on October 1, including a huge military parade and anniversary gala. Protesters in Hong Kong are hoping to upstage the event with another demonstration on Tuesday following a weekend of intense clashes with police. Beijing has been positioning the event as a triumphant celebration of its economic growth over the last seven decades, as well as emphasising the importance of a unified territory and nationalism. “Unity is iron and steel. Unity is a source of strength,” Xi said in his speech. He also referred to the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which Beijing still sees as part of its territory awaiting reunification. “The complete reunification of the motherland is an inevitable trend… no one and no force can ever stop it,” he said.
