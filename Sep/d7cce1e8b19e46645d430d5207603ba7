 Bundesliga minnows Freiburg. Photo: TWITTER/SCFREIBURG  The win leaves Freiburg in third and sees them leapfrog perennial champions Bayern Munich, who were held to a 1-1 draw at league leaders RB Leipzig on Saturday. Freiburg was ruthless in the first half and deserved their two-goal lead at the break. Guenter swept in the opener after a darting run in from the left wing on 11 minutes, and Petersen had a goal ruled out for offside shortly before the half-hour mark. Haberer doubled the lead on 38 minutes, picking out the bottom corner brilliantly from the edge of the area. Hoffenheim, who had shown only flashes of danger in the first half, were caught napping when an unmarked Petersen poached the third goal on the hour mark. Freiburg have now won three of their opening four games, with only Bayern and Borussia Dortmund have managed to score more goals. In Saturday’s later game, promoted side Paderborn look to pick up their first win of the season when they host David Wagner’s Schalke.
