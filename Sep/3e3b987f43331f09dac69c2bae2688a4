The rift for the year 2019 has officially been settled as Lionel Messi becomes the FIFA Men’s Player of 2019 Award and Megan Rapinoe takes home the FIFA Women’s Player of 2019 Award. Footballers have, for generations, shown us that asides putting in all the work on the field, they know what it means to have style in the fashion world. At the event which held at La Scala opera house in Milan, not only did we see some emerge victoriously, it was clear that the footballers came ready to serve looks with some scoring at the fashion goal post.
