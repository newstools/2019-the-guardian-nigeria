Davido on Thursday evening hinted at a new collaboration with American pop star Chris Brown. The “Fall” crooner in a Twitter post announced that the new feature with Brown would be released next week. “New @chrisbrown x OBO next week!!!! KIDDO KIDDO @KIDDOMINANT !!”  In July, the pair released their first collaboration “Blow My Mind” – the song became an instant hit, topping music charts in just a matter of days. Meanwhile, Davido gears up to release his highly anticipated second studio album in October 2019. In September 2019, the Afropop artist hosted an event tagged, “Catch Up with Davido” in Lagos. The upcoming album will be a follow-up to Davido’s first album “Omo Baba Olowo” which was released in 2012. His last body of work was an EP titled “Son Of Mercy” in 2016.
