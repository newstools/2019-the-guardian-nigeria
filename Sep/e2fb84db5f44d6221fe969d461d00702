A Federal High Court, Abuja will hear the application of the Department of State Security (DSS) to detain the publisher of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore, for 20 more days. The Nigerian Government had filed a seven-count charge bordering on treasonable felony, terrorism and plots to overthrow President Muhammadu Buhari. Sowore, presidential candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC) was arrested by the DSS Saturday, August 3 for planning a nationwide protest tagged #RevolutionNow. The government’s application to detain Sowore for 20 days more, if granted, will mean elongation of his 45 days in custody. The Nigerian government filed additional charges against Sowore on Friday, September 20, a day before the completion of the initial 45 days the court allowed the DSS to keep him in custody. Two previous bail applications challenging his detention by DSS had been rejected by the court. Justice Nkeonye Maya, Wednesday, August 28 declined his last bail application filed by his lawyer Femi Falana. The judge sent the case back to Justice Taiwo Taiwo for further hearing. Justice Taiwo had, in a ruling on August 8 ordered Sowore’s detention for 45 days to enable the DSS to carry out and conclude its investigation on allegations levied against him. A day later, Sowore asked the court to rescind the order. The DSS had also, on August 20, challenged the court order, allowing it to detain Sowore for 45 days against its request of 90 days pending investigation. Falana in an affidavit told the court “That the applicant (Sowore) herein has never been charged with any criminal offence whatsoever” and should be granted bail. He posited “That the Nigeria police also conducted investigation on the matter and made its findings public” and did not incriminate Sowore as alleged.
