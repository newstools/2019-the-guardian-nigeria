He added that the committee would also partner with relevant agencies in returning IDPs to their communities in Borno. “By Parliamentary practice, we came to see. The next thing is to do our report,” he said. The report, according to him, is to find lasting solution to challenges confronting the living conditions of IDPs in camps and their infrastructure. He stressed that good sanitation, housing and basic necessities to life, which IDPs are entitled to in camps are very important, saying even though the people are displaced from their communities, they have not lost their rights as citizens. According to him, the Kampala Convention will provide a holistic approach to the issues of IDPs in the country.
