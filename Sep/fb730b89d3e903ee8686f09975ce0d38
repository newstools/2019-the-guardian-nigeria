Raphaka said Lake Ngami, situated some 1,000 kilometres northwest of Gaborone has seen the surface water drying up slowly but surely thereby creating sticky miry clay. “Around 38,000 livestock depend on the waters of Lake Ngami but the animals have been stricken by a crippling drought,’’ said Raphaka. According to Raphaka, the livestock is being trapped by the mire. The livestock, mostly cattle and goats, are dying every day while trying to make their way across the mire. He said the farmers have to walk long distances in hopes of taking their animals to better places where they can find anything to eat. “Some succumb to the heat and vultures can be seen feasting on their corpses in the sludge of the drying lake,’’ he said. In May this year, President of Botswana, Mokgweetsi Masisi, officially declared Botswana to be in drought after months of unevenly distributed rains, heat waves and dry spells.
