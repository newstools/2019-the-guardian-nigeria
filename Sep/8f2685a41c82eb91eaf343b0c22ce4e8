National women’s team captain Janine van Wyk, after whom the club is named, told AFP she was “thrilled Caster had chosen to join her team”. Semenya is following in the footsteps of Jamaican superstar sprinter Usain Bolt, who trained with Australian club Central Coast Mariners after retiring but did not secure a contract. International athletics body the IAAF ruled this year that females like Semenya who have differences of sexual development have a competitive advantage. It barred such athletes from competing in races between 400m and the mile unless they took testosterone-reducing medication. Semenya refused and won a legal battle, enabling her to compete in 800m races, before a Swiss court overruled the decision, forcing her to miss the upcoming world championships in Qatar.
