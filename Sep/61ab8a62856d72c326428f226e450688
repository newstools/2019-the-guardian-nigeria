 Super Eagles’ suspended Coach, Salisu Yusuf has completed his one-year ban from all football-related activities.  Following the incident, the NFF Ethics and Disciplinary Committee found Yusuf guilty of breaching the terms of his contract and subsequently banned him for a year with a $50,000 fine.Yesterday,  NFF’s Head of Communications Department, Ademola Olajire, said in a release that the federation had ‘noted’ that Yusuf had served his ban, adding that the board  would  meet later to deliberate on his future.
