Mac Miller died of an accidental drug overdose on September 7th 2018, and now TMZ reports that the late rapper’s alleged drug dealer has been charged in connection with his death. Authorities have alleged that on the morning of September 5th 2018, 28-year-old dealer Cameron James Pettit supplied Miller with counterfeit oxycodone pills that contained fentanyl, which is estimated to be somewhere around 100 times stronger than morphine. Investigators said they believe Miller’s death was caused by the fentanyl-containing drugs supplied by Pettit. “Fentanyl disguised as a genuine pharmaceutical is a killer—which is being proven every day in America,” United States Attorney Nick Hanna said in a press release. “Drugs laced with cheap and potent fentanyl are increasingly common, and we owe it to the victims and their families to aggressively target the drug dealers that cause these overdose deaths.” Pettit was charged with one count of distribution of a controlled substance on Wednesday in a criminal complaint from the Central District of California. He was named as one of three people responsible for the supply of fentanyl-laced oxycodone pills alongside two unnamed individuals. Prosecutors have claimed that Miller asked the dealer for “percs,” prior to his death.
The charging documents state that authorities executed search warrants at multiple locations including the rapper’s home, and plastic bags containing Xanax, cocaine, and fentanyl were discovered. At the time of Miller’s death, traces of cocaine, fentanyl, and alcohol were in his system. If convicted of the drug charge, Pettit will face a maximum 20-year prison sentence.
