In a relationship, it is natural to feel a little jealous, especially if you have a strong feeling for your partner. Occasionally, jealousy is okay because it adds a little sparkle and excitement to your relationship but when is extreme you need to be cautious so it won’t destroy your relationship. According to Helen Fisher, the author of “why we love”, stated that a little amount of jealousy is permitted because it arouses your feeling, you are lucky having an attractive and pretty partner, it makes you more loving and nice to your partner but when it is chronic and debilitating and it becomes a problem. Below are ways to help you deal with outrageous jealousy: Trust: The foundation of your relationship is trust. A relationship without trust is a time bomb about to explode at any time. Your relationship has to be built on trust, to prevent a fight and break up. First, you need to trust yourself before you can trust your partner because if you don’t trust yourself, you will find it difficult to trust your partner and you can’t give what you don’t have. Set Boundaries: Your relationship can’t be healthy until you and your partner set boundaries, communicate what you both like and don’t like and you both respect them. Also, don’t forget to discuss what is causing jealousy between you and your partner.  Calmness: You have to realize that love comes with risk and all rosy relationships have a price. Any time you feel jealous calm down and remember the beautiful days. Control Your Feeling: Control every negative feeling you have about your partner and don’t let it build up. Your partner doesn’t belong to you alone; at times they might feel like interacting with someone else which doesn’t mean they are cheating. If you question your partner motive call and discuss it with them.
