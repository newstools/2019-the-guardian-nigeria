Shortly after hip-hop heavyweight M.I Abaga and his rasta released their lyrically rich cypher and accompanying visuals courtesy of Martell, Vector assembled a small unit comprising of himself Vader and Payper to fire back but it has all ended in tears. A 5 pm release time was announced via Vector’s official Twitter account but unfortunately, the highly anticipated drop was foiled by M.I who not only leaked the track but went as far as botching the album art to insinuate that all three rappers are bare clowns.   The audio was released via YouTube by M.I before Vector and his camp could make the move but it seems Vector and his squad might have the last laugh after all. The track is riddled with heavy bars, direct shots and innuendos fired at M.i, Blaqbonez and other participants of the Martell Cypher. Dealing a direct verbal blow to M.I, Vector rapped;
“How are you a beast when you are the size of a chiuwawa, I’m the King Kong in the city ema ni wa le ba wa wa”
This above bar was obviously a shot at M.I’s small size and stature being in contrast with the high position he places himself in Nigerian rap. Vector emphasizes that he’s the real beast [King Kong] in the city and M.I is small fry. Listen to the entire track via YouTube below;
