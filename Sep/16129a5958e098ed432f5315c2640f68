Shuaibu Langa APC member representing Mubi North in the Adamawa State Assembly was sacked for certificate forgery while Musa Bororo APC member representing Mubi South constituency for “bearing three inconsistent names. Langa election was nullified on Monday because he forged the first school leaving certificate, according to the panel. The tribunal ordered that the Independent National Electoral Commission to issue a certificate of return to Peoples Democratic Party’s Suleiman Vokna. However, Langa said the tribunal’s judgment was “too unbelievable.” “How on earth at this 21st century that somebody like me to not have finished primary school and I’m parading myself with a fake school leaving certificate,” Langa said. While for Bororo the tribunal accused him of using three names, Musa Umar Bororo instead of “Musa Umar” which is the official name in the documents submitted to the INEC. The court held that INEC should issue a certificate of return to Musa Dirbishi of the PDP. Bororo has also vowed to challenge the ruling.
