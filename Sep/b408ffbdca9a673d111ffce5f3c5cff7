After yesterday’s early morning downpour in some parts of Lagos State, residents of Idi-Araba in Mushin have lamented the unending flooding of their area, especially along the LUTH Road at the drop of any rainfall. According to them, the ugly situation has remained an eyesore to members of the community and passersby. One Mallam Yakubu, a resident told The Guardian that they are already sick of the filthy environment worsened by the blocked drains and bad roads. “Whenever it rains, it is as if all the filth from Mushin is washed on to the road. The whole environment will be filled with smelly water and refuse. This is an unwelcoming sight to most road users and unfriendly development to students and users of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH).”According to Mrs. Rose Ngozi, the area is a worse place to raise up children as the ugly sight of the refuse washed onto the road could make one sick.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
