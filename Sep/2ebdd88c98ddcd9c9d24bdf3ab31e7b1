• Says Nigerians Will Rise Up To Fight Accusers
The leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has affirmed support for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who is facing allegations of corruption, insisting he is innocent of the allegations. President of CAN, Rev. Supo Ayokunle, while addressing journalists after a visit to Osinbajo, said the association’s leadership was at the Presidential Villa to pray for the vice president and to ask him if the allegations against him were true or false, adding: “And he has cleared the air that there is no iota of truth in the allegations leveled against him.” Ayokunle stated that Osinbajo also affirmed that he was ready to prove himself and go all out with them, saying if there is an allegation, there must be evidence to prove, urging the CAN leadership to see it as rubbish that can never happen. On whether Osinbajo would step down to be probed, the CAN president maintained that it was left for him (vice president) to determine, saying: “We are not in his position. If the allegations are not true and the people who alleged cannot prove it, then the church will be very proud of him and will continue to be proud of him, and we are praying for him.” He warned peddlers of the false allegations against toying with the innocent that have faithfully served Nigerians for whatever reason, noting that the whole of the country would rise up to fight such people if they don’t desist.Ayokunle urged Nigerians to team up to fight and overcome the challenges facing the country, saying: “If we resolve to fight the challenges with the will power within us, in the Name of the Lord we serve, we will overcome.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
