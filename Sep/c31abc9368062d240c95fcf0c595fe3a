Visa issues remain a major bone of contention. Despite the Binational Commission between both countries having been elevated from vice-presidential to presidential level in 2016, it has not met in six years, and elections in both countries earlier this year have taken up much of the political energy. It was not a good sign that neither president attended the other’s presidential inauguration.President Buhari’s planned – but not confirmed – visit to South Africa next month should go ahead, as it would provide an early opportunity to reset this relationship. Four recommendations are critical to achieving success.  First, Abuja and Tshwane must immediately revive the Binational Commission and ensure that regular meetings occur. Second, the early-warning and mediation systems – involving Nigerian and South African civil society and government representatives – agreed after the 2017 attacks against Nigerians, must be urgently established and made to function effectively by both sides. Third, “track-two” initiatives involving civil society, academia, and the business sectors of both countries must work with the two governments to improve people-to-people relationships and ensure ongoing dialogue between key actors on both sides. Finally, South African politicians must stop fanning the flames of xenophobia and show genuine leadership in promoting grassroots anti-xenophobic movements in local communities, as well as educating their population on the contributions that Nigeria and many other African countries made to the liberation of South Africa during the dark days of apartheid.
