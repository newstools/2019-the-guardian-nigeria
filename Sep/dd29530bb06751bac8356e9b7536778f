Ekeh, described the pedigree of men and women assembled on one Board as unmatched anywhere in the world including corporate America. He said that these are men and women who have delivered different assignments creatively in this country. They are not imported with artificial profiles. His words “When you have assemblage of first class tech regulator, auditor, accountant, banker, tax expert, tested entrepreneurs and more on one board, you can only anticipate positive result” “I must commend South Africans for believing us and have the Will to appoint this quality of Nigerians. They know the digital and financial value of these men and women they have assembled if the compound power of their brains were to be traded in any stock market in the world. They have added impetus to the quality of the last board of directors headed by Dr. Pascal Dozie” When asked if he holds substantial shares in MTN, he said he has no single share past and present, but when you see things like this, it means there is hope.
