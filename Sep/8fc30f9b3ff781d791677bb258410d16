The 51-year-old multiple award winning singer on Wednesday released “Lying Down,” “Imperfections,” and “Courage”. The Pop queen is back full force after the 2016 death from cancer of her husband-manager Réne Angélil. In an interview with USA Today, she said: “Since my husband passed away, I’ve taken on the rest of the package deal… I’m not playing the boss, I am the boss.” The album “Courage” is due out November 15. It will be Dion’s first English-language studio album since “Loved Me Back to Life” which was released in 2013. The new songs coincide with the start of Dion’s Courage world tour in Quebec City. She released her last LP, Encore un soir, in 2016. “The Power of Love” a film based on Dion’s life and featuring her music, will be released in 2020.
