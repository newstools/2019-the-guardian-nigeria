The Taraba State Primary Health Care Development Agency (TSPHCDA) has said that male involvement in family planning is now on the rise. Executive Secretary of TSPHCDA, Alhaji Aminu Hassan Jauro, who stated this yesterday during the review meeting of the Social Behaviour Change Communication Committee (SBCC), said the achievement was made possible by Governor Darius Dickson Ishaku, who according to him, provided an enabling environment for partners to operate.
