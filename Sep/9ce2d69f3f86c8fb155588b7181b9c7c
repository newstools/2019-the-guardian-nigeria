J. Cole Retires From Doing Features | PHOTO: J Cole performing at the Castle Lite Unlock concert in Lagos American rap artist J. Cole has announced he would no longer doing features. The “KOD” rapper made the announcement on a Friday in a tweet he posted hours after the release of “Family and Loyalty,” a Cole-assisted new Gang Starr song. “This a honor to be on this song. NEW Gang Starr This is the last feature you’ll hear from me. Thank you to everybody I got to work with during this run. @REALDJPREMIER This song a classic, thank you. RIP GURU”  J. Cole has had an impressive feature run from his Dreamville imprint’s Revenge of the Dreamers III compilation album this year to giving out features to the likes of Ty Dolla $ign (“Purple Emoji”) and Young Thug (“The London” with Travis Scott), among others. In an interview with XXL Magazine, Cole, who had just wrapped up his KOD tour at that time, spoke on his feature run: “Last year, I set an intention to say yes way more than I say no. Say yes to features. Step outside of my comfort zone. And it’s still going. I’m trying to level up this year on the features. Last year was like a preview. I don’t want to be done with rap years from now and look back like, Damn, I didn’t even work with nobody. I don’t want to have no regrets. The year that I’m going to have is all coming from a place of when this shit is all said and done, I want to know that I left no stone unturned. I fucking did everything I wanted to do. Even shit I didn’t want to do but ended up being glad that I did it in the end.” Listen to “Family and Loyalty” below:
