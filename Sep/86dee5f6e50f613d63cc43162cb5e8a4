Polluting the environment, according to environmentalist and founder of LUFASI Park, Desmond Majekodunmi is pouring poison into the atmosphere. Reason he said Nigerians must join the campaign to halt the polluting of the environment by planting and encourage tree planting, to reduce carbon emission and pollution. Majekodunmi said the systems are breaking down rapidly, which are actually life supports. He made this known during a sensitisation walk held in Lagos and organised by the Urban Tree Revival team of LUFASI Park. “We should have it in our minds that we are destroying the wonderful work of creation, so we should identify it and find solutions. We can’t continue pouring poison into the atmosphere.” Project Coordinator of the team, Eko Omobola encouraged young people to explore opportunities in waste recycling, as it could reduce Nigeria’s unemployment rate.A participant at the walk, Chimuanya Dike said the message of tree planting to save mother earth is critical.
