The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Youth Network has called on Bayelsa residents to ignore rumour being peddled by unscrupulous characters about a purported meeting between Governor Seriake Dickson and the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva. Secretary General of the PDPYN, Mr. James Oputin, while describing the rumour as a product of mischief makers, said politicians behind it were scared of the growing internal cohesion within the PDP ahead of the November 16, 2019 gubernatorial election in the state.He said any attempt to put unnecessary doubts in the minds of well- meaning supporters of the party in the state should be resisted. The PDPYN Scribe said that Dickson and the leadership of the PDP did not need any meeting with leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to win the forthcoming election. He said while it was possible for the governor to host Sylva in his capacity as the minister representing Bayelsa in the Federal cabinet, it was sad that some APC members were peddling deliberate misinformation to deceive the people about a meeting that did not take place.
