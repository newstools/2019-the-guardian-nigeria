PSG will also be without Neymar, who scored an added-time winner against Strasbourg in his first start of the season on Sunday, as he has to serve a three-match suspension in the Champions League for insulting the referee following his side’s elimination by Manchester United last season. PSG have Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and recently arrived Mauro Icardi as options in the center of the attack.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
