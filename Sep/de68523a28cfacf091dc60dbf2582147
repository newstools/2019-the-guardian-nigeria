Akwa Ibom State Governor, Mr. Udom Emmanuel, has debunked speculation that he would impose a candidate on the state in 2023. Emmanuel said he has no plans to continue as Governor of Akwa Ibom State for a third term, using a surrogate as a successor. He made this declaration, yesterday, while interacting with members of Mboho Mkparawa Ibibio, a foremost socio-cultural organisation of Ibibio youths, who paid him a visit to celebrate his victory at the Governorship Petitions Tribunal. Emmanuel said: “I hear people say I have anointed someone, who will take over from me so that I can manipulate the person to do my biddings after leaving office, I want to assure you that it is not true.
It is only God, who knows who my successor will be. When He presents him, we will support him to also succeed…” Earlier, the President of Mboho Mkparawa Ibibio, Akpawara Patrick Udofia, said the association came to register its goodwill to the governor on his second-term as confirmed by the Tribunal.
