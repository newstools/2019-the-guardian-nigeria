Some Christians integrate yoga and other aspects of Eastern spirituality with prayer and meditation. This has been attributed to a desire to experience God in a more complete way. There are some etiquettes required while doing Yoga and they are below: Get there early This will help you get in a good mind set.  If you’re late, just wait until the opening ritual is finished.  Stay for the entire class You don’t want to miss out on savasana, the final relaxation. If you must leave early, let the instructor know. Leave shoes and cellphones outside the room This helps to keep the studio floor clean, and the class free of phone distractions.  Skip the perfume and scented lotions Avoiding fragrances helps the other students keep their focus and yoga is about focusing.  Wear appropriate attire Comfort and practicality are your guides. Modesty is also welcome. Remember, you are going for a yoga class and not a fashion parade. Wear what is fit for the exercise and do not be over-dressed.  Check your judgments at the door Sometimes the unexpected happens in yoga. Keeping an inward focus will help maintain the sense of a safe yoga space for all.  Be respectful A mantra of respect for everyone in the room, including yourself, will help you get the most out of your practice.
