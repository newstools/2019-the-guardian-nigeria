 Ben Eragbai  Your connection to your Church, Man of God; family background, academic qualification, marital status, financial strength, philanthropic work, etc, which is very good cannot qualify you as a born again except you accept Jesus into your life. Nicodemus was a ruler of the Jews but there was a vacuum in his life. He was perplexed when he saw the miracles that Jesus performed but Jesus redirected his attention from miracles to righteousness. “Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God” – John 3:3. The eternal inheritance belongs to the righteous. Live it and manifest it and all good things shall follow you. Pray These Prayers Fervently This Week:
  • Lord Jesus, I receive you into my life as my Lord and personal Saviour.
  • Father, I want to love you and know more of you in Jesus name.
  • By the blood of Jesus, I shutdown any satanic agreement made against me.
  • I invoke the blood of Jesus against evil conspiracy against me and my family in Jesus name.
  • Any area in life I have been commonised, let the blood of Jesus upgrade me in Jesus name.
  • By the blood of Jesus, I separate myself from every curse from my past.
  • I break every covenant of failure, disappointment and setback by the blood of Jesus.
  • Father, anywhere life has stripped me naked; I receive restoration in Jesus name. Divine Appointment Ministry Int’l
