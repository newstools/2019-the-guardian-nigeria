Photos of the interior are currently unavailable, this is because the property was never publicly listed for sale. However, as Variety notes, Powers Development were behind the mansion, and the company is known for its luxury homes.   The house features four bedrooms and seven bathrooms across three stories and 5,350 square feet. This isn’t the first time the rapper has dropped a lot of money on some property, however, as he previously spent $523,400 for a house in Eastvale, Riverdale County in 2016. Just a year after, he paid $2.65 million for a home in a gated community in Calabasas, which he has since reportedly gifted to his mother and other family members. On Thursday, Forbes revealed that Kendrick brought in an impressive $38.5 million pretax in 2019, while he had an even bigger income of $62 million last year thanks to his international tour in support of Damn.
