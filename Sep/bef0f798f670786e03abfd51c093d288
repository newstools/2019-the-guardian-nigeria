Another supports 1000 less privilege kids in back-to-school project 
Worried by increasing drug-induced crime in society, 55 students have been rehabilitated by the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) through the Christ Against Drug Abuse Ministry (CADAM) in Epe, Lagos State. Speaking at their graduation ceremony, wife of the General Overseer, Pastor Folu Adeboye, commended the management and staff of CADAM for their moral support in getting the students through their predicament. The Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osibanjo and Lagos governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who were represented by the Commissioner for Local Government and Community Affairs, Mrs. Yetunde Arobieke, called for a much needed partnership between CADAM and state government to facilitate additional rehabilitation for drug addicts. Coordinator of the centre, Pastor Ezekiel Odeyemi, said the faith-based initiative caters for the treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts from any part of the world. Meanwhile, in fulfilling its vision of touching lives, Eden Christian Centre, Pison Courts, Yaba, has donated school bags and writing materials to over 1000 children in Iwaya and environs in its maiden edition of back-to-school project. According to the Senior Pastor of the church, Akin Akinpelu, the church must no longer sit and take from its members but must be able and willing to give out to both its needy members and the society, adding that the gesture was aimed at giving back to the community. “One of the things I have been doing lately is trying to have an impact on the educational sector of this country. I train teachers and try to reach out to the students as much as I can. I am involved in several projects like the Volunteer Corps that deals with over 15,000 children, but we ask ourselves as a church what we can do to keep impacting on our community.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
