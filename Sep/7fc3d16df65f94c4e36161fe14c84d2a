 Oluremi Tinubu  A seven-hour judgment delivered by the three-man tribunal led by Justice Kunaza Hamidu, held that the petition filed by Chief Adesunbo Onitiri of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) challenging the election of Oluremi Tinubu failed, as it did not establish any prima facie case against her. The tribunal declared: “The petition lacked merit and is hereby dismissed. The declaration of Senator Oluremi Tinubu by Independent National Election Commission (INEC) as winner of February 23, 2019 National Assembly election is hereby affirmed.”Onitiri had alleged that INEC wrongly declared Senator Tinubu as the winner of the polls with 131,725 votes, while he was said to have scored 89,107 votes. He said that INEC ought to have declared him (Onitiri) the winner of the elction instead of Tinubu, claiming that he scored the highest votes cast at the election. But in their defence, Senator Tinubu, APC and INEC through their counsel, Ezekiel Ashade and Busayo Onabanjo, refuted all the allegations contained in the petition, describing them as unfounded fabrications.The three-man tribunal, which granted the prayer of the respondents and struck out the ‘offensive’ paragraph, held that the petitioner failed to substantiate and give details of all allegations raised against the election of Senator Tinubu. They, therefore, declared that the National Assembly election from which Senator Tinubu emerged winner was held in accordance with the electoral act and other relevant laws.
