PSC chairman, Alhaji Musiliu Smith The Police Service Commission (PSC), yesterday said the recent crisis between the Commission and the Nigerian Police Force (NPF) regarding the recruitment of over 10,000 Constables into the Force, would not affect its relationship with the law enforcement agency. PSC spokesperson, Ikechukwu Ani, who disclosed this in an interview with The Guardian, assured that the Police and the Commission are working for the same purpose, adding that the face-off would not affect relationships with the Force or their ability to discharge their duties effectively. He said: “We are not working for ourselves; we are working for government and we should be able to discharge our duties at any point “We have taken our case to Mr. President. These are two government agencies that are under the Presidency. It is obvious that it is a case of fact that the Commission is constitutionally charged with the responsibility of appointments or recruitments. “Whether you call it appointment or recruitment, it is the same thing, because the public service rules clarifies it and the Police is a public agency that is under the rules. “Whether it is selection or filling of vacancies or appointment of persons who are not already in the system, that is what the public service rules says about recruitment. There is no doubt that it is the responsibility of the Commission to recruit and we have taken our case to the President and it has been resolved.” He added that the PSC was created by the 1999 Constitution (as amended) as an oversight body on the Police, in terms of appointments, promotions and exercising disciplinary control on members of the NPF, except the IGP.
