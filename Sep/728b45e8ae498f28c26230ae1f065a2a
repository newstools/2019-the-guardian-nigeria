Arsenal coach Unai Emery has named Switzerland international Granit Xhaka as the Premier League team captain, BBC’s David Ornstein disclosed. “Exclusive: Arsenal head coach Unai Emery has named Granit Xhaka as permanent captain,” Ornstein tweeted on Friday. He said Emery “consulted players before relaying final decision to squad this (Friday) morning.” Emery had asked his players to vote for their preferred choices as captain as he rebuilds his five-man leadership group, according to defender Rob Holding. He introduced a pool of five captains following his appointment last year but out of his original choices, Laurent Koscielny, Petr Cech and Aaron Ramsey have left the club. Before his announcement as the team’s captain, Xhaka has worn Arsenal’s armband in six out of eight games in the 2019/2020 Premier League season so far with Mesut Ozil being the only other member of the initial five captains of last season still at the club. While Xhaka has been named captain on his 27th birthday, the vice-captaincy role was yet to be finalised between strikers Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.
