Analysts at Codros Capital Limited said: “We expect the market to remain pressured given global risk-off sentiments and weak domestic participation. “Nonetheless, we note that valuations remain attractive while price deterioration has resulted in expected dividend yields on some stocks rising significantly to levels on par with yields on Treasury bills. “Hence, we advise that long-term investors consider appropriately timed investments.” The Chief Research Officer of Investdata Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omodion, said the gradual positioning of smart money at this stage of the market should give discerning investors and traders insight as to where, or how to invest wisely with all eyes on President Muhammadu Buhari’s newly-constituted economic advisory council to see their first move and the roadmap that can further trigger buying interest among the investing public. “Bargain hunters should take advantage of low stock prices to position now that index had pulled back. Discerning investors should latch on it to average down and recoup their investment immediately a recovery stage is set through economic policies and things start to change gradually to influence equity prices positively. “Investors should watch these sectors that have become defensive recently like insurance, banking, industrial goods, services, and oil/gas and will go bullish in no distance time. “Also, with all eye fixed on the newly appointed economic advisory council to settle down and kickoff,” they said.
