 Former National Secretary of the Labour Party (LP), Mr. Kayode Ajulo  He said his call is predicated on Nigeria’s ratification of the protocol to the African charter on Human and Peoples Rights on the establishment of African Court on Human and Peoples’ Right, which was signed on May 29, 2004. According to him, the mandate of the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Right is to monitor respect for human rights on the African continent in line with the instruments. He stressed that it is elementary principle of international law that a state is entitled to protect its subjects, when injured by acts contrary to international law committed by another state, from whom they have been unable to obtain diplomatic action or international judicial proceedings on behalf of its citizens. His words: “Thus the Federal Government must toll the path of law and order to protect the rights of Nigerian Citizens in South Africa affected by the xenophobic attacks in order to get justice for the gruesome violation of their fundamental rights in South Africa. “The court is empowered to hear cases brought against African states for failure to respect human rights. It is able to issue binding judgments in such cases and where violations are found, may award compensation and other remedies to victims.”
 
Ajulo, who described the attack as barbaric, commended the court on its various decisions ranging from its declaration that the mass deportation of hundreds of Gambian workers by Angola was a violation of their rights to freedom of movement and liberty among others decisions. “I must also add that this is a matter that must be of interest to every progressive in Nigeria. Lawyers particularly should not shy from this sacred responsibility to stand up for affected patriots as I wont hesitate to stand up and be counted if my service is sought for pro bono poblico,” he stated.
