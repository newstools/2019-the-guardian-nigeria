Kano State Hisbah Board has destroyed over 196,400 Bottles of various alcoholic drinks worth over N50 million in the state. “It is against this background, I call upon the suppliers and those that consume the alcohol to shun the act as Hisbah Board will not relent in its effort to fish out the perpetrators and take them to court at any given time for prosecutions,” Commander General of Board Sheik Haroon Muhammad Sani ibn Sina said on Sunday during the public destruction of the alcohols at Kalemawa village in Dawakin Tofa local government area. Sheik Haroon posited that the action was in line with session 401 of 2013 Shariah law in Kano. He said the act clearly prohibits sells and consumption of all sort of alcoholic drinks, maintained the board had already secured court order to destroy the prohibited drinks. The DG Hisbah said men of the board intercepted and confiscated over 12 trucks of alcohol drinks on their way to Kano adding that necessary legal injunctions have been secured to destroy the seized drinks. Flagging off the exercise, deputy Governor, Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna said Islam has strongly condemned the drinking of alcohol and all other intoxicants that can distort mental capability. He said Kano will continue to rid off all sort of illicit activities against the tenents and Sharia of Islam. Gawuna assured that all other shari’a agencies in the State would enjoy similar promotion and support with State Hisbah Board to enable them to discharge their mandates.
