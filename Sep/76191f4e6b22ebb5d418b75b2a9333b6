 [FILE PHOTO] Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa.  The governor condemned in strong terms the unacceptable conduct by some persons who use his name without seeking his consent to make comments on national issues. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Fidelis Soriwei, yesterday, Dickson said that while he was reputed for making comments on sensitive national issues, it was odd and criminal for any person or group to make attribution to him in statements he did not authorise. He warned those behind the act to desist forthwith. Stressing that it was conventional to consult him on all statements to avoid being misrepresented, the governor directed that every statement from the forum must be personally authorised by him. He said, “It has come to my attention that some members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) use my name to issue statements without seeking my consent and approval, especially on issues involving the PDPGF. “Everyone knows that I am capable of taking positions on national issues. Cowards should not hide under my name and that of the forum to make statements. I have always made statements on issues that I am passionate about without any fear. “I condemn in very strong terms any tendency to wilfully use my name to issue statements without my consent. It is reprehensible, condemnable and must stop forthwith. “Henceforth, all statements emanating from the PDPGF must be authorised personally by me.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
