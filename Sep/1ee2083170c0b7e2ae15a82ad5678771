The top five states with highest number of base stations are Lagos- 4,764; Ogun- 1,931; Rivers- 1,676; FCT- 1,684 and Oyo-1,303; while the states with the least number of base stations are: Yobe-205; Zamfara-223; Gombe 286; Jigawa- 289; and Kebbi- 298. NCC noted that the number of existing base stations in the country invariably affects the quality of service (QOS) within the country thereby positively impacting the level of telephone penetration within the nation, which equates to attracting foreign investment and growth in the telecoms industry.
