Exercise is one of the essential ways you need to stay healthy. Toning exercises are physical exercises used to develop physique with a large emphasis on musculature-“the arrangement of muscles in your body” and it requires two steps: strengthening and developing your muscles, as well as losing fat, so they are more defined and visible. A recent study in the Public Library of Science (PLOS) states that participants who undergo a total of 30 minutes of high-intensity interval exercise each week improved their fitness and muscle functions than participants that undergoes 150 minutes of steady, moderate-intensity exercise each week. Here are some exercises that can tone your body: Squats: Squat is a great exercise for lower body workout and core strength as well as the flexibility of lower back and hips. It also helps your body function in ways that help it perform well in real-life activities. Contrary to the belief of many, squats are not just for weight lifters and bodybuilders; they are for anyone who wants to tone their body. When you bend to tie your shoelace and pick up things, you squat. Squatting is a natural form of exercise and the difference between the two is you deliberately maintain a right posture. Benefits:

Repeat this procedure 10 to 20 times and do this twice a week for a start. Push-ups: Push-ups are beneficial for building upper body strength and they work the triceps. The triceps, also called brachii (Latin for “three-headed muscle of the arm”), is a large muscle on the back of the upper limb of many vertebrates. It is the muscle principally responsible for the extension of the elbow joint (straightening of the arm), pectoral muscles and shoulders. They can also strengthen the lower back and core by engaging and pulling in the abdominal muscle. Instructions
