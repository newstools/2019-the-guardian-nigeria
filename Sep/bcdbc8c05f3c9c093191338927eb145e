Breakfast photo 1QFoodPlatter Breakfast has been argued to be the most important meal of the day. However, there have been so many arguments against this but none can be said to hold water. As an important meal of the day, here are some meals that you should strike out of your breakfast choice. Smoothie According to the British Heart Foundation, your smoothie might be packing more sugar than you think. “If you blend fruit, the natural sugars are released from within the cell walls of the fruit and become free sugars,” the foundation states. “Free sugars include any added sugars (including honey and maple syrup) and are the kind we should all be cutting down on to protect our teeth [and] maintain a healthy weight.”  From this research, smoothies are not very healthy for breakfast because of the sugar level which is detrimental to human health. Cereal According to Authority Nutrition reports, “Starting the day with a high-sugar breakfast cereal will spike your blood sugar and insulin levels. A few hours later, your blood sugar may crash, and your body will crave another high-carb meal or snack, thus creating a vicious cycle of overeating.” The sugar in cereals is therefore not too healthy for breakfast. Also, for children, this might not be too healthy. Donuts Donut will not do you any good for breakfast, donuts are loaded with sugar and offer little nutritional substance. This fried goodie is also packed with with trans fat and another sodium. There is also salt in donut and too much salt in your system will cause your body to retain fluids, creating extra stress on your heart. Coffee Coffee is the go to breakfast mean for so many people, however, it is not healthy, the caffeine in coffee might dull your appetite temporarily. This can make you dehydrated and can cause dizziness through out the day. It is important that you avoid taking caffeine without food in the morning. However, if you are bent on taking coffee, you can take it with enough water.
