The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Education Board has identified shortage of specialised teachers, classroom congestion and poor funding as major challenges facing both primary and secondary schools in the territory. The Board said it got approval from the FCT administration to increase the number of primary and secondary schools in the city from 150 to 160, to meet enrolment in rural areas before the end of this session. Chairman, FCT Education Board, Yahaya Musa Mohammed disclosed this when he and other board members toured selected schools in Jabi and Garki. Executive Chairman, FCT Education Management Board, Kabiru Ibrahim Matazu said  the authorities have reached 90 percent completion of 2013-2015 projects it inherited from past administrations, adding that the board has successfully addressed insecurity related issues in all government schools in the territory by building fences and hiring security officers to protect the schools.
