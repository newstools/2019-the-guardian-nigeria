 Institute of Directors  The institute argued that it was not enough for government to gather together time-tested economists, but to “walk the talk” by applying the advice and interventions of the council in its policy formulation, especially as it concerns fiscal and monetary policies. The Director-General of IoD, Bamidele Alimi, who noted that the institute has taken keen interest in the new development, said it will work with all relevant stakeholders, on behalf of its members and business leaders to monitor and evaluate the outcomes and impact of initiative for the overall benefit of Nigerians and businesses. “If this process is well managed and the council is allowed to independently execute its mandate and government gives adequate attention to the interventions from the council, there is no doubt that this development will engender sustainable economic development for the country,” he said. He disclosed that the institute will activate a process of engaging with the government towards ensuring that the objectives of putting the EAC in place are fully realised. While commending President Muhammadu Buhari for constituting the new council, made up of professionals, who have exhibited the expertise required to provide the needed economic direction for the country, Alimi said the new development is auspicious and timely at a stage of the country’s search for economic stability.
