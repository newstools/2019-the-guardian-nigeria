Earlier this month, the Queens-based superstar announced that she would be putting her career on hold so that she can start a family with her rumoured husband Kenny Petty. At the time, nobody was too sure about what to expect from the legendary rapper. Would she actually be sticking to her word and hanging up the microphone for good? Well, it turns out that her retirement only lasted a few weeks because, already, she’s announced her comeback effort. Taking to Instagram some moments ago, Nicki Minaj told the world that she will be featured on a new song by PnB Rock and Murda Beatz, previewing the hit on social media. “I swear, this is really my favorite song,” says the vocalist at the beginning of the snippet. The cover art shows all three musicians decked out in their Fendi prints and, considering the track is titled after the luxury fashion brand.   @pnbrock ft Nicki Minaj & Murda Beatz – Midnight TONIGHT #Fendi @fendi A post shared by  Barbie (@nickiminaj) on Sep 25, 2019 at 11:28am PDT  As expected, fans lefts tons of comments which are overwhelmingly positive on Instagram with many saying that they never believed she was actually going away forever. Still, we have so many questions after this. Why would Nicki Minaj announce her retirement only to return a few weeks afterwards with a new feature? Is her break only beginning after this song? Do feature verses count? Until all these questions are answered, we will enjoy every bit of music she throws at us.
