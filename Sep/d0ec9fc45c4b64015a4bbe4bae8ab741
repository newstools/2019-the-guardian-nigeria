Peter Okoye, a former member of the defunct group Psquare, has denied promising to give 2019 disqualified BBNaija housemate, Tacha, 60 million Naira if she doesn’t emerge the winner. Okoye was reportedly seen during a live video making the pledge to the most controversial housemate of the season. Following the turn out of events and Tacha’s disqualification, Okoye made another live video on Friday to debunk the promise. According to him: “I said I will teach her how to make N60million, I never said I will give her N60million.”    A post shared by  Tunde Ednut (@tundeednut) on Sep 27, 2019 at 11:47pm PDT  Peter went ahead to pledge to give N10million to anyone who can provide video evidence or a tweet where he promised Tacha N60million. However, a certain @shybloggerpr shared supposed screenshots of Peter’s tweets on July 31, 2019, which showed him making the promise stated above.  Will Peter pay the 10 million naira as promised again? Or will he deny this too? Either way, at least he now knows Nigerians ALWAYS keep ‘reciepts’.
