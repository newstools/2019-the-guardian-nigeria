The police on Wednesday arraigned four men in an Ikeja Magistratesâ€™ Court in Lagos, for allegedly swindling Jumia International of N14.9 million. The police charged Fatai Lasisi, 30; Saheed Adebayo, 39; Olusegun Oladosu, 29 and Gbolahan Akinyetan, 28, with conspiracy, obtaining goods under false pretences and theft. The Prosecution Counsel, ASP Ezekiel Ayorinde, told the court that the defendants committed the offence between February and July. He alleged that defendants and others, at large, conspired and defrauded Jumia International Ltd to the tune of N14.9million. Ayorinde alleged that the defendants fraudulently ordered goods using different names and locations and refused to pay. The offence, he said, contravened the provision of sections 287, 314 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. After the charge was read to them, they pleaded not guilty. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that section 287 prescribes three years jail term for stealing while section 314 attracts 15 years for obtaining goods under false pretences. Magistrate Mrs B.O Osunsanmi admitted them to bail in the sum of N1million each with two sureties each in like sum. Osunsanmi ordered that all the sureties should be gainfully employed and must show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. She adjourned the matter until October 16 for hearing. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
