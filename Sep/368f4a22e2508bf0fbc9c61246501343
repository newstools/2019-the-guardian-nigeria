 Youth dressed in traditional Zulu attire hold posters during the 10th “Durban Sari Stroll” march on Durban’s beachfront on September 15, 2019, as the annual Durban Beach Sari Stroll has evolved from celebrating the sari to becoming an advocate for women’s issues. – The sari forms part of the cultural and religious attire that transcends the boundaries by its universal colourful appeal to all women. The stroll is to promote social cohesion across race and age boundaries in celebration of the sari.

Women and children are under siege”. His remarks come after Women’s Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane reported that more than 30 women were killed by their spouses in August alone. Police reported a nationwide average of 110 rapes a day last year. Promising legislation to force longer minimum sentences for crimes against women and children, Ramaphosa said a series of reforms would curb “male-perpetrated violence”. “Those who are found guilty for those charges should not be eligible for parole,” he said. “If sentenced to a life sentence, this must mean what it is, life in prison.” Ramaphosa said his government would release an extraordinary 1.1 billion rand ($75 million) budget over six months to fund the plan. He also announced the creation of a fund for private companies to finance prevention and education programmes to stop violence against women. We will “ensure that justice is served, perpetrators are held to account,” Ramaphosa said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
