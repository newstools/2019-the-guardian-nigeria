 [FILE PHOTO] Tunde Bakare  Two separate reports published on Monday, 23 by news platforms, Vanguard and Legit, claimed that the politician pastor made the declaration during the last Sunday service. “Bakare, during his sermon on Sunday, September 22 said that nothing could change it because he was born for that purpose,” Legit reported. Vanguard, in its report claimed, “Bakare, during his sermon on Sunday, said that nothing could change it because he was born for that purpose to be president.” <img class="size-full wp-image-1026175 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Legit-Tunde-Bakare.png" alt="" width="995" height="410" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Legit-Tunde-Bakare.png 995w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Legit-Tunde-Bakare-487x201.png 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Legit-Tunde-Bakare-974x401.png 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Legit-Tunde-Bakare-320x132.png 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Legit-Tunde-Bakare-640x264.png 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Legit-Tunde-Bakare-600x247.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 995px) 100vw, 995px" /> <img class="size-medium wp-image-1026176 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vanguard-Bakare-590x598.png" alt="" width="590" height="598" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vanguard-Bakare-590x598.png 590w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vanguard-Bakare-100x100.png 100w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vanguard-Bakare-487x494.png 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vanguard-Bakare-237x240.png 237w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vanguard-Bakare-473x480.png 473w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vanguard-Bakare-592x600.png 592w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vanguard-Bakare.png 627w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /> Social media platforms were also awash with similar claims, making Tunde Bakare number one trend in Nigeria on the twitter trend table. The video tweeted here, has been seen more than 4,000 times on Twitter since it was shared by one Raymond King PhD, on Twitter. The same video was shared on Facebook by Reno Omokri with claims that a news platform, Nigerian Tribune, wrote an “explosive” story on Sunday, September 22, 2019 after Bakare “made this prophesy.” The post has been shared 195 times. But the video, while authentic,  was from a Sunday sermon on February 18, 2018. The video was first shared on a YouTube channel on February 21, 2018, here. A keyword search on google also confirmed the date, February 21, 2018. The controversies around the video may have sparked by the recent rumours of the Nigeria’s vice-president Yemi Osinbajo’s troubles. There are unconfirmed reports predicting that Osinbajo may be impeached and be replaced with a popular pastor from the Southwest, with all fingers pointing to Bakare. Bakare, one of the most politically influential pastors in Nigeria, has many times criticised previous and present governments in the country. He was the running mate to President Muhammadu Buhari in the 2011 presidential election which they lost to Goodluck Jonathan.
