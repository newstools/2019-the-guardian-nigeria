Floor of the Anambra State House of Assembly was shaken yesterday by the defection of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) lawmaker, Ikem Uzozie, to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Announcing his defection on the floor of the house, Uzozie, representing Aguata II constituency, thanked his colleagues for every support while working together. The Guardian gathered that Uzozie emerged the factional speaker during the crises that rocked the assembly, following the unsuccessful attempt by members to impeach the speaker, Rita Maduagwu, last year. He was suspended together with two others by APGA on the allegations of involving in anti-party activities and being the arrowhead of the crisis in the house last November.
