Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari is expected to extend the Central Bank of Nigeria’s governor Godwin Emefiele’s tenure for another term.

Following the renewal of his appointment for the next five years, the CBN governor will have to balance fighting inflation and propping up the currency against pressure to boost an economy that’s expanding slower than emerging-market peers.
