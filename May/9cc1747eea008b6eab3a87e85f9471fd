Game of Thrones fans got an inside glimpse at the previously when HBO aired “The Last Watch” on Sunday. The two-hour documentary, curated by Jeanie Finlay, offered a look at what the cast and crew of the fantasy series experienced during the filming of its eighth and final season. Although the documentary could easily be dismissed as HBO’s way of maximizing its ample investment in the series and extend the program’s run by one more week, the two-hour documentary served a dual purpose, offering a reminder of all the grueling work that went into making it. Director Jeanie Finlay spent a year chronicling the production, spanning locations from Belfast to Croatia to Spain. While the stars and producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss received a bit of screen time, the project went the extra mile to showcase those who don’t walk red carpets but work behind the scenes to bring the show to life, from background actors, to construction workers, to the cooks responsible for keeping the cast and crew fed while on set. The documentary is essentially a ‘last hurrah’ to the people whose contributions to the show weren’t heralded by fans or the media.
