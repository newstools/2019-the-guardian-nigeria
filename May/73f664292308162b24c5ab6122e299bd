It was a comeback that would rival Istanbul and it started coming as early as seven minutes into the game. Divock Origi, on for the injured Mo Salah, started the comeback with a tap-in on seven minutes. It was a goal that looked more like a consolation as the rest of the first half ended without Liverpool finding a way through to Ter Stegen’s goal. All that changed in the second half. Second half substitute, Georginio Wijnaldum, who replaced the injured Andrew Robertson, scored twice in three minutes to draw the Reds level at 3-3 on aggregate, before Trent  Alexander-Arnold’s genius quick corner caught Barca sleeping and allowed Origi to stroke home his second with 11 minutes to play. Barcelona looked laboured and rarely threatened to cancel the party as Liverpool booked a showdown in Madrid against Ajax or Tottenham. Speaking after the game, two-goal hero, Origi said he was detailed by the coach to stay close to the Barcelona defenders and try to catch them off guard. “We knew we could do it and trained very hard for this night. I am so excited,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
