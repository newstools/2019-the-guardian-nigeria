It was dashed hopes for the Bello family after the dead body of their daughter, Adewura Lateefat, was allegedly found floating in a canal at the Iyana Ipaja area of Lagos, 12 days after she was declared missing. The 26-year-old got missing on May 15, in Lagos and was last sighted by her colleague who dropped her off at Medical Road, opposite Ikeja bus terminal. At about 6:00p.m. of same day, she had reportedly told her sister that she was around Cement Bus Stop on her way home. That was the last anyone heard of her. The family raised an alarm on social media and a public search began for the deceased, fondly referred to as Wura. After the family reported to the police, her phone number was tracked to Badagry but she wasn’t found until 7:00p.m. on Sunday when her family identified her body. According to a Twitter user, @OfficiallBmax, who broke the news, he said Wura’s body was discovered in a canal. According to findings, on the day she was declared missing, she had boarded a motorcycle in the downpour to hasten her journey home. On getting to a flooded road, the motorcyclist, who was warned by onlookers to wait for better visibility, ignored them and attempted to ride through the flood. They both ended up being swept away by the flood but the motorcyclist however survived, and was immediately rescued by pedestrians and handed over to Moshalashi Police Station. Adewura was however unlucky as she was swept into a canal through an opened manhole When contacted, the state police spokesman, DSP Bala Elkana, ruled out abduction given that no ransom was demanded. While admitting that he was just hearing that her body has been found, he said there was no possibility of it being a kidnapping case. According to him, every kidnap case must have an evidence, and the kidnappers would have contacted someone to demand ransom, which was not the case in this matter. “A body has been recovered at a canal in Ipaja, but it can’t be concluded yet if it is her body as the body was already decomposing. The police will depend on medical examination to ascertain whose body it is, as the body has already been taken for medical examination.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
