Nigeria Senate Thursday passed the Public Holiday Act Amendment Bill to recognise June 12 as the countryâ€™s Democracy Day. President Muhammadu Buhari announced that June 12 will be Democracy Day to honour Moshood Kashimawo Abiola, who is the acclaimed winner of the June 12, 1993, presidential election. The bill was passed almost one year after Buhari announced that June 12 would replace May 29 for Nigerians to commemorate the return of democratic. Although a few lawmakers protested the change in date of Democracy Day, it was, however, approved after a majority of the lawmakers supported passage of the bill. The passage of the bill means the amendment to the Public Holiday Act has been effected in concurrence with the House of Representatives. The bill is expected to be forwarded to Buhari for assent.
