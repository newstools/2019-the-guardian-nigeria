President Muhammadu Buhari acknowledges cheers just before he was sworn in for a second term as the president of Nigeria PHOTO: TWITTER/VON Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari has been sworn in the country’s capital city Abuja for a second term. Buhari won a disputed presidential election in February, defeating his former ally and the candidate of the People’s Democratic Party Atiku Abubakar. “I do solemnly swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to the Federal Republic of Nigeria,” Buhari said at Eagle Square, Abuja. “I will preserve, protect and defend the constitution.” Buhari, a former military head of state, was first sworn in as a president in 2015 in a historic ceremony that marked the first time an opposition candidate will take over from an incumbent. His swearing-in ceremony on Wednesday was devoid of the much fanfare that characterised the 2015 ceremony. In fact, today’s event ended without him delivering the traditional inaugural speech. Analysts said the president will have to get to work without delay to actualise his Next Level agenda. Nigeria is struggling from multiple conflicts, including an Islamist insurgency in the northeast of the country. His time in power has also been dogged by questions about his medical fitness. He has spent several months abroad for treatment for an unspecified condition. Buhari has touted himself as a “converted democrat” to persuade those with misgivings that his military past was history. But in office, he has struggled to shake off claims of authoritarianism — particularly in his fight against corruption which critics say has been one-sided against perceived political opponents.
