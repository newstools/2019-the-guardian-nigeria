To catch them young as future leaders, parents have been challenged to encourage creative instincts in the children and boost their self-confidence through participation in the arts. The principal of the India section, Marymount International School, Lekki, Mrs. Sulagna Majumdar who made the appeal in Lagos, stated that art is a form of human expression that creates avenue of expressing oneself while the world becomes increasingly wired, hectic and turbulent, drawing remains the purest form of self- expression. Speaking during the 2019 art exhibition organised for pupils of the school where the children showcased their creativity through drawing and painting of flying birds, airplane, wales, tortoise and crabs among others, Majumdar said the aim of the exhibition is for the students to know the importance of art and realise that it is human self expression, which helps them to develop socially, mentally and emotionally.The school, made up of Nigeria and India sections, organises a yearly exhibition called ‘art splash’ where children showcase their talent through art. They sell the artwork  to raise money for the less privileged.She said, “The art splash is for students to know that creativity will help in boosting their self confidence. We bring topic to the children and they work on it for some weeks, they brought it to school and display them. Some parents buy them and money realised is donated to charity. Last year about N120, 000 was collected and it was donated to orphanage homes.”She explained that the annual art splash is to provide a platform for the budding artists to bring out their latent creativity. She urged the parents to set up an art space where kids could be free to experiment. On his part, the school art teacher, Mr. Kevin Kemnasom said some people don’t appreciate art because they think it is relegated.“For a student, art is used to develop a mind of creativity. We showcase our talent to bring up students not only on art but also to meet the need of those that are less privileged. We introduce the students to different medium like pencil and paints, so with time we get to know the medium a student is good at or what is easy for a child to work with and we build on that. Some children has their own creativity and their parents are putting in more effort, they love that their children are doing art.”
Kevin stated that every child that participates in art has a future and art itself is a medium used to express emotion. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
