 [FILES] Gov. Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa  He stated this in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media Relations, Fidelis Soriwei, insisting that the decision of the next Chairman of the NGF should be guided by the time tested principle of rotation between the North and South. Dickson said following the end of Governor Abdulazeez Yari of Zamfara State’s tenure, the next Chairman of the NGF should come from the South. He added that governors elected under the platform of the PDP would not contest the position in consonance with the precedence that the NGF chairman should be a ranking governor from the ruling political party. “PDP Governors would not make any move to endanger the time honoured principle guiding the emergence of Chairman of the NGF. However, the next NGF Chairman should emerge preferably through consensus among members of the NGF,” the statement added.
