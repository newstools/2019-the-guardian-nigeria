It was a black day for Andy Bature when he was abducted on his birthday with his two other friends on their way from Kaduna State to Bauchi State. Narrating his ordeal at the kidnappers’ den, Bature told The Guardian that they were made to trek over 60 kilometers all through the night in a deep forest while crossing three rivers before arriving at different caves. He said: “We were kidnapped at Jingir on our way back from Kaduna. We climbed mountains and entered more than three caves on the way. From my conversations with the Fulani men, they said their cattle have been rustled by security men and were given weapon in return. They told us many things but all I can say is there are conspiracies around the insecurity in the country. “They said government must end the poverty and provide jobs for citizens, that they have cells everywhere. As we were kidnapped, it was aired on a radio in Jos, they told us that our abduction was on air.” Though Bature refused to reveal the ransom paid to his abductors and how he was released after three days, he said the abductors fed them with one mango each as breakfast, lunch and dinner with water of 35cl for the period. “We only sip it to wet our throats. There was a serious threat to life at any point of the negotiation, as they transfer aggressions from our family members to us. In fact, there was a man, whose family had paid ransom of N46 million, but to our surprise their commander ordered to kill him.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
