The Nigeria Senate Thursday approved the appointment of new director-general of National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brigadier General Shaibu Ibrahim. The Senate investigated the appointment of Ibrahim after Senator Dino Melaye, representing Kogi West, raised a point of order that the  Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Tukur Buratai contradicted the law by appointing the new DG instead of the president. The Senator argued that a Director-General is to be appointed by the President, according to Section 5 of the NYSC act. “The Act gave authority to the President. Previous Directors-General were appointed by the President. We are not in a banana republic. NYSC is not a formation of the Nigerian Army but on the enactment of the National Assembly. “We should not allow a Constitutional country governed by laws be taken for granted,” Senator Melaye said. The Senate eventually referred the matter to the Committee on Youths and Sports to investigate the matter and report within a week. Senate President Bukola Saraki ordered the Chairman, Senate Committee on Youths and Sports, Senator Obinna Ogba, to ensure that the “report should be back, laid and considered as it is straight forward.” A week after the committee was set up to investigate Ibrahim’s appointment, the report revealed that due process was followed in the appointment of the new DG.
