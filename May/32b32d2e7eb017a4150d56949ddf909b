The raging crisis between Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano state and Emir of Kano, His Highness Mohammadu Sanusi II, continues as Sanusi was conspicuously absent at the inauguration of the governor. Ganduje created four new emirates with first class emirs, a development many believe was targeted at curtailing Emir Sanusi’s powers in Kano Emirate. As at 10 a.m, the Sani Abacha stadium, venue of the swearing in of Ganduje for the second term, was filled beyond capacity. In their colourful arrays, the newly appointed Emir of Bichi, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero; Emir of Rano, Alhaji Abubakar Tafida Ila among prominent government functionaries and captain of industries, were around to grace the occasion. Besides Sanusi’s absence, two out of the newly appointed, Emir of Karaye and Emir of Gaya were also absent. Many traditional chiefs, districts heads and kingmakers were also absent Although, the seat of the Emir Sanusi, was left vacant for several minutes, it was subsequently occupied by secretary to the state government, Alhaji Usman Alhaji. The embattled Emir Sanusi’s absence, The Guardian learnt, was deliberately conceived to avoid a possible attack on his royal train.
