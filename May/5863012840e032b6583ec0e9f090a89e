We all believe that spraying perfume over our clothes is the right thing to do and will probably make it last longer, but in reality, fabric fibers can make perfume smell unpleasant, and perfume can stain fabrics. Terry Molnar, executive director of the Sense of Smell Institute, in New York City says “Fragrance is formulated to be applied to the skin where it interacts with the heat of the body.” Lastly: Don’t rub your wrists together after spraying—this breaks down a scent’s molecular structure. The fix: Before getting dressed, lightly dab or spray perfume directly onto the skin places such as the knees, wrists, base of the throat, and behind the earlobes. This may seem weird but, either by staying too long in the shower or bath or by scrubbing too vigorously; you’ve removed the natural oils and lipids that seal in moisture and protect your skin. The fix:  Try to limit your shower or bath time to 10 minutes max, and use warm not hot water.   A lot of people apply conditioner like it’s shampoo: by starting at the top of the head and throughout their hair. However, the ends of the hair are usually damaged and in need of condition, whereas the hair closest to the roots is healthy new growth. Conditioning the roots can weigh your hair down. The fix: Starting at your ears, apply conditioner all the way to the ends of your hair. You’ll gain volume, condition tired ends, and avoid needing to wash your hair as often. Don’t stop your skin care routine at the chin. The skin on your neck can be thinner and more sensitive than the skin on your face and just as prone to changes in pigment, elasticity, texture, and wrinkles. The fix: When applying lotion, sunscreen or facials to your face, keep going to cover your neck and chest. (Spread some on the backs of your hands too, that’s another vulnerable area.)
