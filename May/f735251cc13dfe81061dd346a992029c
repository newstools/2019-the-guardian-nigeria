 [file photo] Emir of Kano, Alhaji Muhammadu Sanusi II  This is coming barely 24 hours after Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje signed ac act that created additional four emirate councils into law, thereby reducing Emir Sanusi’s powers and influence. The agency had summoned a former Secretary to the Emirate council, Alhaji Isa Sanusi Bayero, for interrogation over allegation of financial transgression on the Emirate’s accounts. Isa, who arrived the commission’s headquarters at 12.14pm, was ushered into the operations unit and later came out after exhaustive interrogation that lasted one and half hours. Speaking with journalists shortly, he affirmed that he was subjected to interrogation on allegations of corruption in the emirate. The agency’s Director of Operations, Sumaila Aliyu Gusau told The Guardian that Isa was invited for interrogation over allegation against the emirate, adding that he (Isa) has requested for more time to respond to some questions he could not provide reasonable answers to during the interrogation. Emir Sanusi had sacked Isa, who is also an uncle to him for allegedly releasing secret documents from the palace to the public. Meanwhile, a non-governmental organisation, the Kano First Forum, yesterday accused the Anti-Graft Agency of laundering a bad image against a respected traditional institution. In a statement issued by Dr. Yusuf Ishq Rabiu, it also decried the speedy passage of the bill, which seeks to create four additional emirates in Kano, insisting that the action may cause disharmony in the state.
