The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission Monday arraigned, Azeez Fashola, a.k.a. Naira Marley at the Federal High Court in Lagos. The anti-graft agency filed an 11-count charge of alleged credit card fraud against Fashola on May 14 in a suit marked FHC/L/178C/19. Some of the credit cards, according to the EFCC, bore the names Nicole Louise Malyon and Timea Fedorne Tatar. The agency said the alleged crimes contravened the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act and the Cyber Crimes Act. The artist was under fire recently following his open support for online fraud. He was arrested on the 10th of May along with four others, including his friend and fellow artist, Zlatan Ibile. Zlatan was, however, released by EFCC without any charges.
