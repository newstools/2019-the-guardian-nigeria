For Barcelona, Philippe Coutinho was preferred to Ousmane Dembele in the front three, the Brazilian taking his place alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez against his former club. Arturo Vidal was a surprise pick ahead of Arthur Melo in central midfield, with coach Ernesto Valverde opting for extra solidity against Liverpoolâ€™s pacey attack.
