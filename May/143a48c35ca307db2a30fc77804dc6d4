A former governor of Jigawa State Sule Lamido has cautioned former Nigeria president Olusegun Obasanjo not to allow his political sentiment against current President Muhammadu Buhari rid him of his statesmanship status. “Don’t let your disappointment with sitting presidents turn you into a bigot,” Lamido said in a statement by his media aide Mansur Ahmad. “You must not abandon the national stage.” Obasanjo at the Cathedral Church of St. Paul’s Anglican Church, Oleh in Isoko South Local Government Area of Delta State claimed that attacks on different Nigerian states and communities by Boko Haram insurgency group were part of plots to Islamise Nigeria. “The twin evils of Boko Haram and marauding cattle herders were initially treated with kid gloves. “Its no longer an issue of lack of education and lack of employment for our youth in Nigeria which it began as, it is now West African Fulanization, Islamization and global organised crimes of human trafficking, money laundering, drug trafficking, gun trafficking, illegal mining and regime change.” Lamido, an ally of the former president, however, believes Obasanjo’s statement was improper of a nationalist. He urged Obasanjo not to allow his disappointment with the current administration to turn him to a religious and ethnic bigot. Lamido called on the former president to withdraw the statement credited to him that Boko Haram has an agenda of ‘Fulanization and Islamization’ of West Africa. “If it were said at a non-religious venue to a non-religious audience, maybe it might have been more tolerable. “The cracks along the various divides in our national cohesion are already turning into huge gorges,” Lamido said.
