Fans are questioning Kylie Jenner‘s knowledge of skin care after the beauty mogul’s face-wash method didn’t seem right. The 21-year-old star, who debuted (and sold out) her skincare line last week, shared a 30-second clip on the Kylie Skin Twitter and Instagram account to show fans how to use the new cleanser, which she recommends applying “morning and night.” In the clip, which was obviously shot using a filter, Jenner rubs the foamy formula over her skin for about 10 seconds before rinsing with water and wiping her face dry with a white towel.  morning and night  pic.twitter.com/y5jibIxnfM — Kylie Skin (@kylieskin) May 29, 2019  However, fans quickly called out Jenner’s face washing technique by saying she didn’t cleanse long enough to fully remove makeup. Many also noted that when the star wiped her face dry, she had a foundation stain on the towel, indicating that she had not cleansed for long enough.

She didn’t have anything show lol — Daria Morgendorffer (@WhatsSleepTho) May 29, 2019     You must wash your face for 60 seconds @KylieJenner not .5 seconds — frank (@justthetip47) May 30, 2019   Love you Kylie Jenner but if you’re showing people how to wash their face with your products, do it properly. Putting cleanser on your skin for 2 sec & washing it off is not effective in any way, shape, or form. Cleanser needs to be used for at LEAST 30 sec to work effectively https://t.co/rZkDXwwuzA — Heidi Schneider (@HeidiErika) May 29, 2019
