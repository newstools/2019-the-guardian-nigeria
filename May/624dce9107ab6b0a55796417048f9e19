Nigerian music rave of the moment, Burna Boy who is getting more vocal by the way in his criticisms of other music acts has slammed his colleagues in the music industry who boast over their compilations of streaming numbers. The “Dangote” singer in a social media post stated that streaming numbers are not the reflection of a singer’s true worth or talent and no one should get carried away by them. He went on to add that if viral songs like ‘Baby Shark’ and ‘Gangnam Style’ could have amazing streaming numbers then no one should get overly excited about the millions of views and listens they get on the internet. He shared on his Instastories, “This streaming shit be making people feel like they are actually talented. If joke things like “Baby Shark” and “Gangnam Style” can do more number than everyone, don’t think you are talented or respected because of your streaming numbers. Everyone with real working brains know what is a joke and what is real. Anyway, plenty talk no dey full basket. Let time reveal all.” Many have since taken Burna Boy’ statement to be a jibe at fellow singer, Mayorkun who recently took to social media some few days back to share his achievement of attaining 70 million streams across different platforms. Some fans, therefore, slammed Burna Boy for what they consider a shade with some users regarding him as a ranter, who should rather focus on his blooming career than dampening the excitements of other artists. We reported earlier that Burna Boy took to social media some days ago to condemn Nigerian artists jumping on international deals. In the post that he shared on his Instastories,  he talked about such artists not knowing what they are getting themselves into. He however expressed gratitude to his mother and manager for helping him navigate without the help of foreign record companies. This post was coming on the heels of Nigerian songstress, Tiwa Savage signing a deal with international record label, Universal Music Group.
