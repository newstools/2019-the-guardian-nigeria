Kompany first joined the Belgian side when he was six. “For the next 3 years, I will take up the role of Player-Manager of RSC Anderlecht,” Kompany said in an open letter on Facebook. “It’s the most passionate yet rational decision I’ve ever made.” “As a footballer, I was born and raised at RSC Anderlecht. Since the age of 6, I have been one with that club. A history of 34 league titles, they are second to none. “I want to share my knowledge with the next purple generations.” Kompany, 33, joined City in 2008, made 360 appearances and won Premier League titles, two FA Cups and four League Cups in 11 years at Etihad Stadium. “He impressed us with his clear analyses and his vision for the future of the RSCA,” club chiefs Marc Coucke and Michael Verschueren said in a translated post on Twitter.
