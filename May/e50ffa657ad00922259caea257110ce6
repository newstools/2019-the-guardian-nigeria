Mulls use of carbon monoxide detectors in vehicles, homes, others To avert a looming violent revolution from poor Nigerians, Senator Chukwuka Utazi (Enugu North) has sponsored a motion titled: Bridging the Gap Between the Haves and the Have-Nots in Nigeria.The motion, which caused heated debate on the floor of the Senate, highlighted the many troubles of widespread abduction of persons, armed robbery and ritual killings in Nigeria.In the motion, the lawmaker expressed concerns that the nation’s poor masses may embark on a revolution against the rich judging from recent events in the country. He stressed that the kidnappings and upsurge in banditry by criminal elements against Nigerians, which have defied all known security measures, confirmed his fears.He expressed worry that in the North East, terrorism and insurgency have assumed a full-blown war and the armed forces and other security services are having a herculean task containing all the points of terrorist activities. Utazi said herdsmen were devastating farmlands, killing people and raping women in the South East, while kidnappers and ritual killers carry out their nefarious activities with precision. Describing the challenge as multifarious, he observed that the North Central zone, known largely for farming, is now under the grip of killer herdsmen, a situation he cautioned, would lead to severe famine.Responding, Shehu Sani (Kaduna Central) decried lack of priority for the country’s poor masses in government programmes, stating that as parliamentarians, there was pressure from the poor people on them.He noted that the country’s socio-economic pattern was that of master-servant relationship, which he said, no longer works and advocated conscious intervention to better the lot of poor Nigerians.

This follows Senate’s unanimous endorsement of the motion that would require Nigerians to use and install carbon monoxide detectors in their vehicles and dwelling places.
