A chieftain of the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Femi Fani-Kayode Friday commended the reported ambition of national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Bola Tinubu to run for the office of Nigeria president in 2023. “I am not in Bola Tinubu’s party but I commend him for having the courage to aspire to be Pres. in 2023,” Fani-Kayode said in a tweet. Fani-Kayode, a former Nigeria aviation minister during former president Olusegun Obasanjo administration, said Tinubu’s reported ambition stands him out from other southern politicians of the APC and PDP. “How many southern politicians from either APC or PDP have had the guts to do that? If nothing else he has challenged the myth that the north owns Nigeria,” Fani-Kayode said. Since the conclusion of the 2019 election when President Muhammadu Buhari secured re-election to office, Tinubu’s reported ambition to succeed Buhari after the 2023 election got even stronger. But the former Lagos State governor had not said denied or attested to the claims. Fani-Kayode said the APC national leader “has also challenged the view that the north owns the APC.” On two occasions, Tinubu’s anointed candidates – Babatunde Fashola and Akinwunmi Ambode – were elected governors of the state. Another of his supposed political godsons, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, will succeed Ambode, who is the current governor of the state, after the swearing-in ceremony on May 29. However, Fani-Kayode believes members of the ruling party are aware of his capabilities and have resorted to ‘rubbish’ his person. “-And that is precisely why some northern hegemonists and irredentists within his own party are now attempting to rubbish him and undermine his efforts,” Fani-Kayode said. “Let us wait and see how successful he (Tinubu) will be in his quest.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
