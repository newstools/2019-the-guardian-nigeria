 [FILES] Fayemi  He said progress could only be achieved when the executive and legislative arms of government synergise in a very responsible manner in the overall interest of the people. Fayemi, who spoke in Iloko-Ijesa, yesterday, at a three-day retreat organised by the state for National and State Assembly lawmakers-elect, said his administration did not want a rubber-stamp legislature or “a cantankerous Assembly” but one which would partner with the executive to deliver the goodies of good governance to the people. The governor said the fact that the next Assembly is dominated by All Progressives Congress (APC) members did not mean lawmakers could not voice out their opinions on issues. “Ekiti people are the ones that elected you into office, and you have a duty to represent them well.
