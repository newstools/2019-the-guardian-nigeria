Photo/twitter/inecnigeria  INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu stated this yesterday at a meeting with stakeholders from Bayelsa State at the commission’s headquarters in Abuja. The delegation, led by Deputy Governor, Rear Admiral Gboribiogha Jonah (rtd.) told the commission that the date clashed with the state’s yearly thanksgiving service, which is backed by law and which has been observed for the past seven years. He said although INEC was empowered by law to fix election dates, it was appropriate for the state government to ask for a change of date. Yakubu, however, said INEC would deliberate the state government’s request and announce its decision on Friday.
