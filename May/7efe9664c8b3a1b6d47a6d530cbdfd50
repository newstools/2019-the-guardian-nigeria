A Kwara State High Court 9 has convicted Saad Alanamu, a former chairman of the Governing Council of Kwara State Polytechnic, Ilorin, and Salman Sulaiman, the chief executive director of Namylas Nig. Ltd, for bribery. The duo were arraigned by Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission on an 8-count charge for bribery. Alanamu was nominated into the Board of ICPC in 2017 but was later dropped on an allegation of graft which the ICPC was investigating. He was charged for collecting N5 million bribe from a contractor friend as kickback for the award of a contract. ICPC also accused Alanamu of giving out the construction and furnishing of an auditorium in Kwara State Polytechnic, at the cost of N182.3 million, contract to a company belonging to his friend when it was not qualified for such. Sulaiman was accused of bribing a government official when he paid the said sum of money into Alanamu’s Guaranty Trust Bank account as a reward for the award of contract to his company. Both pleaded not guilty to all the charges. The judge, Justice Mahmud Abdulgafar, however, found Alanamu guilty and sentenced him to seven years imprisonment on counts 2 and 3, and five years with hard labour on counts 1, 4, and 5, without an option of fine. Alanamu was also ordered to pay the sum of N25 million pursuant to Section 20 of the ICPC law. Justice Abdulgafar also found Sulaiman guilty on counts 5 and 6, and sentenced him to five and seven years imprisonment respectively. The company, which is the third defendant, was ordered to pay a fine of N1 million.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
