Following their plea of not guilty, EFCC counsel, Rotimi Oyedepo prayed the court for a trial date and urged it to impose stiff bail conditions on the lawyers. However, counsel to Awhana, Oluwaseun Olusiyi prayed the court to grant bail to her client. She said the bail application was dated May 17,2019. Also, second defendant counsel, K. U Ani, told court that his bail application dated May 17 also asked the court to grant him bail on self-recognisance. Justice Dada therefore ruled that since settlement was ongoing between the complainant and the defendants, she ordered them (Awhana and Okoro) to submit their international passports to the court and adjourned to June 4, 2019.
