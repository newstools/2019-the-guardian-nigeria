Residents of Agidingbi in Ikeja yesterday marched to the Lagos State House of Assembly to protest against the judgment of the Supreme Court, which awarded ownership of 398 acres of landed property in the community to a traditional land-owning family, Akinole-Oshiun. The possession order is said to cover a large section of Lateef Jakande Road, Acme Road, Fagba Close, and other str
eets around the area, totaling more than 2,000 buildings. The protesters, who marched from Agidingbi to the Assembly complex in Alausa, said Akinole-Oshiun family, which is the judgment-creditor, had already given them seven days ultimatum to vacate their houses, urging the state government to quickly intervene to avert bloodshed. The family had through a Caveat Emptor notice pasted in the area last week indicated readiness to commence execution of the judgment following the receipt of the Certified True Copy of the Form O confirming that the vast land covered by Survey Plan No. CK/LS/272 dated 22/12/1977 drawn by Abolade Coker, Licenced Surveyor had been delivered to them. In a letter delivered to the lawmakers, the Baale of Agindingbi, Ganiu Ayinde Aruna, intimated the state government and Assembly of the looming danger, threats and action being orchestrated by the family. Speaking on behalf of the protesters, Wasiu Bolaji Seidu, Ojodu council legislative member, said Agidingbi had been in existence for over 200 years and that it was not possible for somebody to wake up to take over the land based on a court judgment which they were not a party to. He said Alhaji Okunnu, the late Abibat Mogaji as well as their great-grandfathers were part of Agidingbi, asking the government to intervene in the matter to avoid bloodshed. Receiving the protesters, the Deputy Majority leader, Olumuyiwa Jimoh, said the Assembly would look into it and get back to the community. But the family through their solicitor, Ayo Opadokun & Co, stressed that the title of the said parcel of land has been variously re-affirmed in favour of the Akinole-Oshiun family. Mr. Kayode Akano, who spoke on behalf of the firm, said the Supreme Court had granted ownership of 398 acres of the disputed land to the family, and “by the judgments of High Court of Lagos State in Suit No ID/216/77L delivered by Justice B.O. Martins on August 19, 1983 and re-affirmed on March 26, 1993; 36 years and 26 years ago respectively.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
