Veteran Nollywood comic actor, Hafiz Oyetoro better known by his alias, Saka has taken to social media to celebrate his wife of 16 years. The screen star who is also a lecturer in the Department of Theatre Art at Adeniran Ogunsanya College of Education, Lagos State, Nigeria in his celebratory post expressed regret that he did not marry his wife earlier than he did. Sharing pictures of he and his wife, he wrote, “Today, (May 24 2019), sixteen years ago, Olaide Saidat said “yes” and we became husband and wife. But I have regret. In my life, the only regret I have is that I got married to her just only sixteen years ago and not earlier than that.
 It has been sixteen years of loving and mature understanding. Sixteen years of sharing the same vision, dreams, aspirations as a result of divine love. We have been moving from glorious heights to glorious heights. Every time that I consider the trend of things when I got married to this woman sixteen years ago, I always regret I didn’t marry her earlier, much earlier. Maybe thirty years ago, forty years ago or even fifty years ago. Well better late than never. I thank ALLAH for granting me the grace to marry this wonderful, superb, and beautiful mother of our precious kids. Glory be to ALLAH for HIS grace and favour. Please kindly join us to celebrate our sixteenth wedding anniversary. Wishing you all a divinely blessed weekend. … IT IS WELL.” Saka, as he is fondly called, has starred in several Nollywood  films and he featured as the main character in the 2013 advert for telecommunications giant, MTN announcing “I don port o.” In 2016, he appeared in blockbuster films like “The Wedding Party” and in the comedy-crime/heist film “Ojukokoro (Greed)”.
