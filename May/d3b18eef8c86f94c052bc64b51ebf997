The police on Monday said news reports that claimed suspected herdsmen invaded an Enugu state community and killed 20 persons were untrue. A spokesman for the police command Ebere Amaraizu said the fake news was aimed at creating mischief and unnecessary panic in the state. “The said online publication is false, misleading and malicious and should be disregarded as no incident of such took place in Enugu as it was observed to be an old story which occurred long ago in Nimbo Uzouwani,” Amaraizu said in a statement. “The choice of the writer refreshing same with the current date and posting it as a new story and happening is an attempt to mislead good people of the state and also fan embers of acrimony amongst the good people of the state.” He said members of the public are enjoined to go about their lawful normal business and never to entertain fear or panic.
