The decision on May 1 by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne, Switzerland, means female athletes with elevated testosterone will have to take suppressive treatment if they wish to compete as women in certain events. “We’ll file the appeal as soon as we possibly can,” Vuyo Mhaga, spokesman for the South African sport and recreation ministry, told AFP. “We feel that the scientific information that has been brought has been completely ignored.” Mhaga said the appeal, to be lodged at the Switzerland Federal Tribunal, would be based on complaints over the judges’ past record on similar cases, lack of clarity over how the ruling could be implemented and how the evidence was handled. “It is not explained how the IAAF (the International Association of Athletics Federations) is going to administer those regulations,” he said. “We feel that the scientific information that has been brought has been actually completely ignored and we’ve got a belief that a different court will arrive at a different determination. “Everything is being done through Athletics SA… they were the ones who were the applicants.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
