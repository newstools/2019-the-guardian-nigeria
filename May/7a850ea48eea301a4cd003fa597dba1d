Unknown gunmen have kidnapped Taraba State’s Ministry of Water Resources’ permanent secretary, Susana Jonathan. The kidnappers reportedly stormed Jonathan’s house and shot in the air before whisking her away from her residence at ATC area of Jalingo in the early hours of Sunday. “From the intelligence report we have received, the woman is nowhere to be found, but we are yet to receive any official report regarding the incident,” Taraba State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP David Misal said on Sunday. “We want to call on the public not to be afraid of reporting any security threat promptly to security agencies to enable us take proactive measures,” he said. Jonathan’s abduction came few days after the Deputy Registrar of the Taraba State University Jalingo, Sanusi Sa’ad, was kidnapped in his house in the university’s quarters. The kidnappers gained access to Sa’ad house through the backside of the university that was yet to be fenced. Sa’ad’s sibling said the abductors had contacted him and demanded a ransom. But Jonathan’s family are yet to disclose any information as regards the incident.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
