 [FILES] Senate President Bukola Saraki PHOTO: TWITTER/ NIGERIAN SENATE  Acting spokesman of the commission, Mr Tony Orilade said this in a statement in Abuja on Wednesday. The spokesman was reacting to a statement, “EFCC Stop Witch-Hunting Saraki credited to Saraki’s media aide, Mr Yusuph Olaniyonu. According to Orilade, the EFCC has taken note of the reactions of the Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki to the Commission’s inquiries regarding his earnings as Kwara State governor. Recently, the commission had begun investigation into the Senate President’s activities while he held sway as the governor of Kwara. “While it is his prerogative to ventilate his views on the matter as he deems fit, the commission takes great exception at the desperate attempt to cast a slur on its investigative activities by portraying Saraki as a victim of persecution. “Furthermore, the agency finds the attempt by the Senate President to tie our inquest to his International Human Rights Commission (IHRC) appointment and his approaching life out of power as misleading. “This is knowing too well that the background to our current inquiries reaches several years back. “For the avoidance of doubt, the EFCC is obligated by law to enthrone probity and accountability in the governance space and has supremely pursued this duty without ill-will or malice against anyone. “It is in the interest of the public and for Saraki’s personal good, that he is not only above board, but be seen at all times to be so,” he said.
