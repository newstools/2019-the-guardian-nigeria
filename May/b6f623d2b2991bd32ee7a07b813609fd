Members of the Nigerian Labour Congress have on Wednesday stormed the residence of Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, at Asokoro, Abuja, in protest. The protest was over the delay in the inauguration of the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) board by the minister. On Thursday, April 2019, the inauguration of the Board of the NSITF was postponed indefinitely. The event was to inaugurate former labour leader, Kokori Frank, who has been named as board chairman of the NSITF by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. However, last month, the minister removed Kokori’s name from the list of names to be inaugurated. He claimed that President Muhammadu Buhari approved the replacement of the ex-labour leader. In a statement by the spokesperson, Nwachukwu Obidiwe, Ngige said those NLC members insisting on Kokori been the later was to allow space for corruption. “Kokori, a labour leader, was nominated by Ayuba Waba and his journeymen to continue their vicious stranglehold on the NSITF,” Mr Obidiwe said.
