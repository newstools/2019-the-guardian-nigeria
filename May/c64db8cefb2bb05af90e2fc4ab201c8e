At the Yakubu Gowon Stadium, Port Harcourt, a Kunle Odunlami own goal in the 26th minute gave Lobi Stars the lead before Adebambo Ademola leveled scores in the 33rd minute. Katsina United moved up to the sixth position in Group A after beating Sunshine Stars 3-1 through goals by Eric Gwammy, Martins Usule and Tasiu Lawal in the first half. Akwa United lead Group B on 37 points, while Kano Pillars, who defeated Yobe Desert Stars 1-0 in Damaturu are second on 31 points. In Omoku, Go Round failed to ease their relegation worries as they settled for a 1-1 draw against fellow relegation battlers, Plateau United.
