The deputy speaker of Imo State House of Assembly, Ugonna Ozuruigbo, Thursday morning resigned his position. Ozuruigbo’s resignation came less than 24 hours after a majority of 21 out of the 27 lawmakers in the state served an impeachment notice to the speaker, Acho Ihim and the majority leader, Lugard Osuji after suspending them. The Guardian had reported that Ihim was replaced by Chinedu Offor who represents Onuimo, while Lloyd Chukwuemeka of Owerri North took over from Lugard Osuji as majority leader. Trouble started when the speaker adjourned plenary and made away with the mace after reading a letter announcing the lifting of the suspension slammed on the 27 council chairmen by the House last week. Angered by the action of the speaker, who left with Osuji, the lawmakers decided to suspend the duo and announced a temporary speaker and majority leader. Offor told journalists that the 21 lawmakers had also served impeachment notices on the suspended lawmakers. He alleged that Ihim, in a bid to frustrate the impeachment move, had to order his aides to turn off the generating set supplying electricity to the complex. The impeachment notice read by Offor was signed by 21 members of the house shortly after yesterday’s plenary. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
