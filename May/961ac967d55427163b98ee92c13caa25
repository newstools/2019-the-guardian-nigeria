 [FILES] Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE)  Specifically, at the close of transactions yesterday, the All Share Index (ASI) shed 15.13 absolute points, representing  0.05 per cent decline to close at 29,196.87 points. Similarly, the market capitalisation shed N6 billion to close at N10.973 trillion. Yesterday’s decline was due to losses in medium and large capitalised stocks, among which are, Mobil Nigeria, Cement Company of Northern Nigeria (CCNN), Guaranty Trust Bank, UACN Property Development Co and Ikeja Hotel. Analysts at United Capital Limited noted that “looking ahead, we expect activities in the local bourse to remain tepid in absence of positive triggers that could spur massive buying interest. However, we do not rule out the possibility of intermittent gains in the market on the backdrop of bargain hunting of stocks with relatively cheap prices.” Market breadth closed parallel at 14 points on both sides of the charts.
