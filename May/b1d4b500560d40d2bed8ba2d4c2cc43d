A human rights lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Femi Falana, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to order the release of Nigerians in ‘illegal custody’ of the Nigerian Navy (NN). In a statement yesterday, Falana alleged that the individuals had been arrested and imprisoned without being arraigned in court. Falana also alleged that some of the detainees were being incarcerated in an underground military detention facility in Abuja while others were held inside one of the vessels impounded by the Nigerian Navy in Marina, Lagos. He said: “We have received complaints from the family members of 40 Nigerian citizens who are being detained without trial on the orders of the authorities of the Nigerian Navy.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
