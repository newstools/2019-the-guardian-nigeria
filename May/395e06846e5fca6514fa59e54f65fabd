Ogun State chapter of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) has dragged its national president  Chris Isiguzo before a  Federal High Court in Abeokuta over the dissolution of the states’ leadership. The president of NUJ has said the committee dissolved the newly elected leadership of the Ogun State council in line with Article 5, Paragraph 10 of the union’s constitution. “The election was not just nullified. There were series of petitions and the report of the national officers that supervised the election corroborated the contents of the petitions. In fact, one of the national officers said he was held hostage at the election venue.” Isiguzo said. However, the appellants disagreed with the president, stating that the election was fair, free and transparent as it was supervised by the national officers of the union. The Ogun state NUJ chairman, Soji Amosu, was one of the four appellants who sought a restraining order against the national president from conducting fresh election into the offices managed by them. In an originating summons and motion on notice brought pursuant to Order 28 Rule 1 of the Federal High Court (Civil Procedure) 2009, supported by a 32-paragraph affidavit, the applicants sought the interpretation of Article 5 Paragraph 10 and Article 6 Paragraph 7 (f) of the NUJ constitution. During the proceedings, the applicants sought for the nullification of all the decisions taken by the national committee concerning the March 29 election in the state. The presiding judge, Muhammad Abubakar, adjourned the case till May 20  and ordered that all respondents be served the court originating summons and motion on notice before the adjourned date.
