The election tribunal hearing the petition brought before it by the Oyo State All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate in the March 9, 2019 governorship election, Adebayo Adelabu, has dismissed the application to recount ballot papers by the petitioners. In its ruling yesterday, the three-man panel, chaired by Justice Sirajo Muhammed, dismissed the application, adding that it would jeopardise the respondentsâ€™ right to fair-hearing. Muhammed said that the petitioners were only challenging the results of few out of the 33 local councils in the state. He said that the time allowed to amend pleadings had elapsed and no pleadings can be amended at this stage. The judge then dismissed the application and fixed June 10, 2019 for commencement of hearing, adding that pre-hearing has ended.
