 Nigerian Stock Exchange  The President of Ibadan Zone Shareholders Association, Eric Akinduro, said: “Buhari’s administration is one of hopelessness, as nothing positive has ever happened in the market since his assumption of office. 
 
“The capital market is one of the most volatile sector and it will take a serious minded government to revive the market and improve its performances to boost the economy. 
 
“Market capitalisation and prices of stocks had fallen beyond expectations. We had believed that government under buhari administration will deliver positive change, but it has turned a mirage.
 
“His administration has not been investor-friendly. No concrete pronouncement on what direction the economy is going. Just of recent, investors lost their money in Skyebank, in addition to previous ones incurred in the time past.” 
 
The Head of Research, FSL Securities Limited, Victor Chiazor, said: “Given our market capitalisation to Gross Domestic Product of about eight per cent, it is clear that a lot of work still needs to be done.
 
“Clear policy guidelines, tax incentives, access to funding, among others, from the fiscal and monetary authorities need to be put in place, to make the market attractive to corporates willing to list on the exchange. This will help deepen the market and have positive effects on the economy.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
