The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has vowed to shut down the South East and South South geo-political zones with its planned sit-at-home protest to mark its “holy day” in deference to those that have lost their lives to the struggle. IPOB’s Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, in a statement, insisted that today’s exercise would clearly define the actual owners of the land between the government and the people in the affected areas. He added that members of the group had earlier marched around the affected regions to increase awareness for the exercise. His words: “Some call it rally; some say it’s a protest but we hardcore call it IPOB Evangelism. Across the length and breadth of Biafraland, from Asaba to Abakaliki, from Enugu, Onitsha, Owerri, Aba to Igweocha, this chosen breed of fearless warriors, armed with only courage and divine belief in the inevitability of Biafra restoration, marched on streets of the sacred Land of the Ancients on May 28, 2019 to remind those in DSS, army, police and other cowardly civilian killer squads that we IPOB own the land. “This is a clear demonstration to all oppressors, collaborators and traitors alike that no amount of intimidation, abductions, arrests, killings and concocted lies will stop this IPOB. May 30 is a holy day and Biafraland will be on lockdown.” Powerful alleged that the “latest attack, treachery by inconsequential and faceless groups cannot stop IPOB’s sit-at home-order,” adding: “ Biafrans have already determined to remember and honour all the fallen heroes and heroines who scarified their lives for this present generation to be alive today. It is important to remind them that Biafra restoration project is not an Igbo affair, therefore they cannot stop our resolve to stay indoors tomorrow (today).” Meanwhile, some Igbo leaders, under the aegis of AlaIgbo Development Foundation (ADF), have called on sons and daughter of the ethnic nationality to observe May 30 as Biafra Day. In a statement after their meeting with the Association of South East Town Unions (ASETU), the leaders said the day was set aside to remember those killed during the Nigerian civil war. The release was signed by ADF president, Prof Uzodinma Nwala. They stated: “All those who died for the sake of our freedom during the worst pogrom in history in which Ndigbo and their neighbours lost millions of their citizens and several trillions of naira especially before, during and which has continued since after the Biafra war.” “The observation may take various forms according to Igbo tradition and culture without violating any statute. “These may include church services, candle-light processions, sit-at-home, wearing of black uniform and black bands, lectures and symposia.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
