Mbappe, PSG’s gifted 20-year-old striker, lunged with his studs into the knee of Rennes defender Damien Da Silva near the close of extra time on Sunday. Having already missed one game, Mbappe will miss Saturday’s match against Nice and the trip to Angers the following week but will be available for the last two games of the season. The threat of further sanctions hangs over Neymar, banned for three Champions League games after insulting the referee following PSG’s exit from the last 16 at the hands of Manchester United. This time Neymar lashed out at an abusive opposing fan as he climbed the steps to receive his French Cup final losers medal.
