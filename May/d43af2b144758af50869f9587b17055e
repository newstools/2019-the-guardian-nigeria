As such, it’s incumbent on him to likewise appreciate and reciprocate such good gesture by not constituting any breach in the process culminating in the peaceful handover to another duly elected…” It would be recalled that faction of the state’s PDP members in the Joint Transition Committee raised alarm over what they described as insincerity on the part of Okorocha’s team towards successful handover ceremony.In a statement signed by the Committee’s spokesperson, Emeka Omeihe, the group said there was no sign indicating that Okorocha meant his words of ensuring peaceful and hitch-free transition of power.
