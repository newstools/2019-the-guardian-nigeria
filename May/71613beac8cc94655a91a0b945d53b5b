The two deceased are Wale Ayeku, a middle-aged man and one Joseph, fondly called J-Boy. According to eyewitnesses, the deceased were both having shelter in a local ‘Game-Joint’ when they met their untimely death. “There were nine of them under a tree, where young people usually meet to play snooker when the rain started, but the thunder and lightning that accompanied the rain scared everyone. “Not long after the rain started, we heard loud screams and wailing which compelled people to scamper for safety. In the midst of that confusion, we discovered the nine victims were struck down by the lightning, though seven others survived with injuries.” It was gathered that the community believes there is a spiritual root cause of the tragic event, which they hope to know in seven days time according to the Sango priest. When contacted, the traditional ruler, Olu of Ayetoro Gbedde, Sunday Ehindero, confirmed the incident. Meanwhile, a two-hour rain, accompanied by windstorm has destroyed many buildings in the ancient town of Owu Kuta in Ayedire local government area of Osun State. The rainfall apart from destroying many houses in the town, also damaged a section of the palace of the monarch of the town, Oba Adekunle Oyelude Makama. The Guardian learnt that about 16 houses, apart from the palace of the Olowu, had their roofs completely blown off.
