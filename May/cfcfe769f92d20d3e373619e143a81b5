Brie Larson has proven to us that she is more than just a super hero. The Captain Marvel star recently showed off her singing skills with a beautiful cover of Ariana Grande’s “My Everything.”
On Friday night (May 3), Larson  shared several videos of herself singing Grande’s 2014 song on her Instagram Story.
“@arianagrande stan forever,” the 29-year-old actress captioned one of the clips. “Thank you @arianagrande for having the most fun song to sing!!!” she captioned another post. Grande shared Larson’s video on her own Instagram Story, commenting with black heart and teary-eyed emojis.
This isn’t the first time Larson has covered Grande’s music. In March, Larson harmonized to the singer’s “7 Rings” with her Captain Marvel co-star Samuel L. Jackson during an episode of Apple’s Carpool Karaoke. Watch a clip, which was shared on a fan page, below.   Brie Larson singing the music MY EVERYTHING of the Ariana Grande.
