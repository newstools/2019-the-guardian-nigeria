Though the approved figure is little, Kara said, “It is good to start from somewhere as donor agencies are more interested in the commitment of the state governments.” He charged the group on the need to advocate for timely release of the budgeted fund. Lauding the efforts of the government for giving priority to FP in this year’s budget, he is optimistic that there would be an increase in subsequent years, but is sure that the allocated funds would be geared towards it’s aims and objectives. The State Programme Coordinator (SPC) of TCI, Othman Sarki, opined that budget planning and monitoring is very vital for the realization of the mapped out plans for FP in the state and the nation at large.
