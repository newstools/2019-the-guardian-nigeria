Onu said investment in space science technology was to enable the nation catch up with developed world, adding that satellite would improve quality of life of Nigerians. A statement by the Head, Press and Public Relations in the ministry, AbdulGaniyu Aminu, said the minister acknowledged the centre was established to carry out earth observation research, as well as predict and monitor natural disasters not only in the country but also in other parts of the world. “The goals and objective of the centre are to achieve Nigeria’s capability manpower and hardware development that can sufficiently address space geodesy, crustal deformation, coastal deformation, subsidence and global main sea level monitoring,” Onu added. The Director -General of NARSDA, Prof. Seidu Mohammed said the centre was part of the space-based and geophysical tools that would help Nigeria in global geodetic and geodynamical activities and monitoring, prediction of seismic activities and mitigation mechanism. Muhammed said NARSDA needed more funds to enable it acquire modern earthquake-monitoring, detecting and networking equipment and establishment of more seismic stations that would be collated, with Global Positioning system (GPS) , for robust geo-hazards  studies in Nigeria and its immediate environs.
