Itâ€™s an early Christmas for fans as Nigerian pop star, Runtown as he has released his much expected Tradition EP seven days before its initially announced release date. The 6-track project which was slated for a May 31 release was dropped in the early hours of today, May 24. The EP houses five new songs and one already released single, Unleash which serves as a bonus track. Tradition Tracklist Unleash features south-east London artiste, Fekky and stands as the only song that accommodates a guest contribution. The Tradition EP is a follow up to his 2015, Ghetto University album which was released to a wide acclaim. Listen to EP here: https://runtown-soundgod.lnk.to/TraditionEP
