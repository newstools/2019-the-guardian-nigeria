The dream of most women is to meet a man of their dream and ride off into the sunset to have a happily ever after with no interference but for the women of Swaziland, they may have to share their dream man with another woman or women as the case may be. According to multiple reports, the King of Swaziland, King Mswati III has made a declaration in the country that from June 2019, men will be required to marry at least two or more wives face jail. According to IHarare, men from Swaziland are required and expected to take more wives so that every woman gets a husband. The order is coming with the belief that men taking more wives will help women get husbands. The monarch noted that there are more women than men in Swaziland which he says is a very serious problem for a country, which is known to be full of virgins. His train of thought is however been criticised by many quarters as women still being regarded as sex objects meant and marriage the ultimate for social acceptance. King Mswati himself has 15 wives and 25 children, while his father and predecessor has more than 70 wives and 150+ children. In a statement, King Mswati called for all men in the country to marry at least five wives and the government assured the men that it would pay for the marriage ceremonies and buy houses for them. “Here’s the deal, marry at least five wives and you’re assured that the government will pay for the marriage ceremonies and buy houses for them.” King Mswati warned that any man or woman who opposes the decision “will face a life sentence”.
