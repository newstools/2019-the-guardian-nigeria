A Federal High Court in Abuja has dismissed a suit seeking the removal of Senate President Bukola Saraki, Speaker, House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, and 52 other lawmakers. An advocacy group, Legal Defence and Assistance Project, (LEDAP), took the lawmakers to court seeking a declaration that they were no longer members of the National Assembly, having defected to other political parties before the expiration of their tenure. At the resumed hearing, counsel to Saraki and the other senators, Mahmud Magaji (SAN), insisted that the plaintiff had no locus standi to institute the suit since it was not a political party, politician, constituent of the lawmakers or an executive member of either of the political parties. The Court dismissed the case over lack of locus standi. Details later. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
