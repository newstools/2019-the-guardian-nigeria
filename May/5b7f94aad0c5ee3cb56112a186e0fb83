Everyone experiences occasional digestive symptoms such as upset stomach, gas, heartburn, nausea, constipation or diarrhoea. However, when these symptoms occur frequently, they can cause major disruptions to your life. Here are a few ways to improve your digestion naturally: One <span style="font-size: 16px;">of the most common causes of constipation is insufficient fluid intake. Understanding this is quite simple. Our bodies need water to move food through our intestines.</span> Experts recommend between 8-15 8 oz. glasses a day depending on your activity levels. Another way to help you stay properly hydrated is by eating our water through fruits and vegetables high in water (cucumber, celery, watermelon, berries, and citrus fruits). Regular exercise is essential for a healthy bowel movement. Studies have shown that people who exercise regularly have better gut transit time and are able to move things along quicker. The exercise can be as simple as 30 minutes of walking daily. Stretching and yoga can be beneficial as well. Eating healthy fats promotes proper digestion. When we consume foods with omega-3 fatty acids they help absorb nutrients properly (including fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E and K) which ultimately leads to improved digestion. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-925295  lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fibre-foods-1.jpg" alt="" width="1131" height="754" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fibre-foods-1.jpg 1500w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fibre-foods-1-897x598.jpg 897w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fibre-foods-1-487x325.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fibre-foods-1-974x649.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fibre-foods-1-320x213.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fibre-foods-1-640x427.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fibre-foods-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1131px) 100vw, 1131px" /> The average Nigerian only eats around 15g of fibre daily? Women need 25g of fibre daily and men need 38g, according to experts. Most people are unaware that fibre deficiency can lead to constipation, low energy, obesity, heart disease, cancer and diabetes. A diet rich in fibre is essential to add a few more beans, whole grains, nuts, seeds, fruits and vegetables to your meal and enjoy the many health benefits that will follow.
