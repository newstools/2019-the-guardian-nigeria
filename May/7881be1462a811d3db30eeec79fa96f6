So, you too can talk (about me) like this and you call yourself my friend. We eat and drink together. Just four days and you can’t hide your hatred for me. You guys didn’t expect me to return. Nobody is holy and don’t be quick to judge”. The Okotie Eboh in the title of the song is a street in Ikoyi, where the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) office is located in Lagos.
