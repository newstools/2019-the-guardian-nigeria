Linkage Assurance Plc has strengthened its Customer Service Centre to ensure customers get the best of attention and are able to resolve their complaints without going through hassles. The service centre, which has been equipped with state-of-the-art infrastructure and more trained personnel will ensure that customers have unrestricted access to the care officers for any complaints they may have before or after any transaction with the Company. The Managing Director/CEO of the company, Daniel Braie, who disclosed this during the formal launch of the refurbished center at the corporate head office in Lagos, said it is in line with the vision to continue to enhance customer experience. “What we have done today is one of the initiatives we have in our strategy to increase customer service experience because as an insurer, customer is the reason we are in business.” Braie noted that in the past customers with complaints were directed to the technical officers concerned but we have discovered that allowing the customer care officers to take their complaints and follow through until is resolved gives better experience to the customers. “This initiative is targeted at strengthening the customers’ dispute resolution process and enhances the confidence they have on our activities as an insurance company”. Braie also noted that the centre was launched to provide the company’s customers a platform and channel through which they can register their complaints and also to build confidence in current and prospective customers about the firm’s services and ability to meet their expectations.
