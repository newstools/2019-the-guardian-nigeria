Coconut oil is believed to protect the skin from the sun’s harmful rays, acts as a makeup remover, anti-aging oil etcetera but the skincare benefits of coconut oil may have been exaggerated. Keep reading to find out what you should know before slathering coconut oil all over your face. Although coconut oil is usually praised for being a great, hydrating moisturizer thanks to its fatty-acid content, truth is: Coconut oil is actually too thick to soak into your pores and sufficiently hydrate your skin. Technically, they’re best when used as a final step in your skincare routine, to lock in all the hydration and the products applied before it (kind of like a seal) rather than as a moisturizer itself. However, if you are still keen on regular use of coconut oil, make sure to apply it over a layer of moisturizer to make it effective. you can also use it as a lip gel to avoid cracked lips, it acts quickly and even if it goes in your stomach, it will only give you additional benefits. Or better still join the trend of using it as a makeup remover or cleanser since oil dissolves oil. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-924444 size-medium lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cocnut-oil-Photo-credit-Pinterest-e1535407515668-1062x598.jpg" alt="" width="1062" height="598" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cocnut-oil-Photo-credit-Pinterest-e1535407515668-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cocnut-oil-Photo-credit-Pinterest-e1535407515668-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cocnut-oil-Photo-credit-Pinterest-e1535407515668-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cocnut-oil-Photo-credit-Pinterest-e1535407515668-281x158.jpg 281w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cocnut-oil-Photo-credit-Pinterest-e1535407515668-562x316.jpg 562w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cocnut-oil-Photo-credit-Pinterest-e1535407515668-531x299.jpg 531w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cocnut-oil-Photo-credit-Pinterest-e1535407515668-487x274.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cocnut-oil-Photo-credit-Pinterest-e1535407515668-974x548.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cocnut-oil-Photo-credit-Pinterest-e1535407515668-600x338.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cocnut-oil-Photo-credit-Pinterest-e1535407515668.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1062px) 100vw, 1062px" /> According to  Dr. Zeichner Coconut oil is pretty harmless to try. But is it the magical, wonderful, multipurpose skincare ingredient it’s painted to be? probably not! As a cleanser and makeup remover, yes, it works, and as a last-step facial oil, sure, it’ll lock in your moisture. But as far as being an acne treatment, what works for you might not work for me—and, realistically, probably won’t work as well as other tried-and-true treatments out there.
