 [FILE PHOTO] Adams Oshiomhole,  APC leader  Chairman of the forum, Otunba Isaac Emiyede, noted that the group was a major contributor in the last elections and would like to contribute in the growth of the state. According to him, the group is a product of the national leader of the party, Bola Tinubu, who would not want to see it go into extinction. He said: “The reasons for concern is that in all these years of our activities, achievements and contributions, our efforts have not been adequately recognised and rewarded. “The party has not empowered us, neither has it given us any appointment as a group to sustain us and keep us together. During the last electioneering, we were grossly marginalised and starved of campaign funds and materials. “We had to resort to self-help through levies, donations and contributions from our members to fund campaign efforts. “Even in the 2015 general elections, even as our brother and son was at the centre stage, we strictly adhered to the party’s aims and objectives, and we maintained our undying loyalty to the party (APC).” Senatorial leader of the region, Otunba Napoleon Amans, lamented that other regions in the state were involved in the scheme of things in the state. “We have been struggling to be relevant in the scheme of work in Lagos. Southsoutherners are not political prostitutes. We started from AD (Alliance for Democracy). “We have been spending our time and energy to savage our group. We want to urge the leaders to remember us in the scheme of work. Meanwhile, other groups in the party have representatives and well treated, but it is a different ball game for our region.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
