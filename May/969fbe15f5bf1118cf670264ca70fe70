The Aggrieved staff members affected in the recent redeployment of security operatives and Civil Servants in the State House, Abuja, have dubbed the exercise ‘lopsided’ and a subtle ploy by ‘some people’ to populate the Presidential Villa with only northern workers. Those who bared their minds on the issue alleged that the exercise, laced with ethnic colouration, was a plan to pave way for a massive deployment of personnel from a certain region of the country to populate the security structure in the villa. While the transfer “was skewed in favour of some elements from their side, who were retained within safe areas,” a source told The Guardian at the weekend that the exercise carried most operatives from other parts of Nigeria to crisis prone areas of the North. “ Recall that a gale of deployment recently hit the Presidential Villa, with the transfer affecting mainly security personnel and Civil Servants that had been in the State House for over two decades. A circular from the office of the Head of Service of the federation, dated April 24, revealed that a total of 71 staff on SGL 07-14 was affected. The circular, signed by the Director, Employee Mobility, M. S. Naibi in the office of HoS, said all handing and taking over process should be completed on or before May 3, 2019. The affected Civil Servants were said to have been transferred to Ministries of Education, Health, Finance, Foreign Affairs, Environment and office of the SGF and the Head of Service, among others.
