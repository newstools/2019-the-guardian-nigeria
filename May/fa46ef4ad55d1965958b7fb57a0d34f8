For several months now, reality TV star, Kim Kardashian has been working tirelessly in securing the release of some inmates in the United States. We reported earlier that in the last 90 days, the mother of three has been able to facilitate the release of at least 17 inmates. It has now been gathered that the “Keeping Up With The Kardashian” has plans to turn her effort in securing the release of some inmates in the US into a reality TV show. Kardashian who is also on her way to becoming a lawyer has reportedly secured a new true-crime series with Oxygen and the show will focus on those who have been wronged by the American criminal justice system. A statement by Oxygen also confirmed the reports as the outfit released a working title for the show as “Kim Kardashian: The Justice Project.” It is further learnt that the show will take on the form of a two-hour documentary series and will follow Kardashian’s work to “secure freedom for Americans who she believes have been wronged by the justice system.” A press release confirmed the show will offer: “An exclusive, never before seen look inside her mission to tackle one of America’s most controversial subjects.” The Executive Vice President of Original Programming and Development at Oxygen, Rod Aissa said in a statement: “Oxygen is tremendously excited to work with some of the biggest names in the industry on such important projects.” Reacting to the proposed show, fans have taken to Twitter to blast Kardashian for trying to profit from the charity work. Some fans expressed the opinion that they knew all along that her “charity” work with inmates was simply for publicity and to make money. Others, however, defended the star saying that she can help people and still make money from it.
