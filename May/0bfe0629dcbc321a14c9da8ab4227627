 Afghan residents clear away debris at the site of an attack by Taliban militants, a day after the assault on a compound housing an international aid organisation, in Kabul on May 9, 2019. – Taliban militants stormed a US-funded aid group’s central Kabul compound on May 8, having targeted the organisation for promoting Western culture and the “inter-mixing” of men and women.

The Taliban did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The insurgents often use roadside bombs and landmines to target Afghan security forces, but the lethal weapons also inflict casualties on civilians. Amanullah Kamrani, a member of Ghazni provincial council, said the children were aged between seven and nine and at least four of them belonged to one family. Years of conflict have left Afghanistan strewn with landmines, unexploded mortars, rockets and homemade bombs — and many are picked up by curious children. Last month, seven children were killed and 10 more wounded in the eastern province of Laghman when a mortar shell exploded while they were playing with it. According to the United Nations, 3,804 civilians — including more than 900 children– were killed in Afghanistan in 2018, with another 7,000 wounded. It was the deadliest year to date for civilians in Afghanistan’s conflict. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
