The Olukoya Boys are currently third on the log with 28 points after 19 games, while the Sky Blues Stars with 17 points are at the bottom of the table and now battling to overcome relegation to the Nigeria National League. Speaking to The Guardian yesterday, Ohanu said today’s opponent whom they beat in Sagamu in the first round of the NPFL would suffer the same fate, as they were not ready to fritter the chance to appear in the play-off. “What is important to us now is how to secure a play-off and possibly qualify for the continental championship next season. And I don’t see Remo Stars standing between us and our ambition. “Coach Fidelis Ilechukwu has tried his best in order for us to do well this season, and it is now left for us to carry out his plans for us so as to qualify from Group A. The season has been hectic considering the fact that most of us are new in the team. I think we have done well to get to the position that we are now on the table,” he said. Ohanu, who was brought in to replace Stephen Odey, now with FC Zürich in the Swiss Super League, however, appealed to the club’s supporters to turn out in their numbers to cheer the team to victory. “Our supporters have always been cheering us to victory, especially in our home games. I am also appealing to do the same in tomorrow’s (today’s) match,” he stated. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
