The family of the  late Captain Romeo Itima, majority shareholder at Global West Vessel Specialists Limited (GWVSL), has debunked the claim that workers were not being paid because of the court case instituted against Captain Winfred Itima, the managing director of the firm by the estate of the founder. Speaking on behalf of the family in an interactive session with some workers of the firm on Sunday, Mr. Kevin Itima, son of the late Romeo Itima who founded the company, deplored the refusal of the managing director, who is his uncle and father’s elder brother, to pay the salaries of workers for about three years. He also expressed disappointment over what the family termed ‘lacklustre performance’ of the managing director. His words: “It has come to our attention that the Managing Director, Winfred Itima has informed the workers that the civil lawsuit against him by the estate of Romeo is what is delaying the payment of their salaries, nothing can be further from the truth. The MD has not followed ethical business standards, which has not only placed the company within the sights of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) but has also left workers unpaid for over three years.” Speaking on behalf of the workers, Mr. Kabowei Ojigbare, appealed to the estate of Captain Romeo Itima to come to their aid stating that they have suffered for too long. It would be recalled that GWVSL, a maritime security company was established by the late Captain Romeo Itima, who was also the pioneer MD/CEO in 2009. Unfortunately, he was killed at Escravos, Delta State on August 7, 2012 by pirates. When contacted, the managing director declined comment, but a source in the management board said the company’s account had been frozen since 2015 owing to an investigation by the EFCC.
