The 49-year-old man died after being hit on the A406, the North Circular Road, in the early hours of May 20. While both cars failed to stop at the scene of the accident, the police said they were searching for two black 5 Series BMW’s. “Both vehicles police are wishing to trace are black 5 Series BMW’s with the following registrations: EX66 TZE and EX66 TZV,” the Metropolitan said on its website five days after the fatal accident. The police authorities said one of them was believed to have “significant damage” to its front including the bonnet and windscreen. “I have lost my only brother. He was a gentle giant who loved his music and I am going to miss him so much,” the victim sister told the UK Police.
