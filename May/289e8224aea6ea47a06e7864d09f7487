Nigerian songbird, Simi has parted ways with her music label, X3M Music following the expiration of her five years recording contract. Simi’s exit from X3M Music was made known in an announcement on May 1 by the record label’s A&R executive, Vincent Nwanze. It was disclosed in the statement that both parties have determined to not renew the contract. The statement reads, ‘We only sign artists that we love and believe in. We know our taste in music is rather different, but we only sign talents who meet that taste. Fortunately, we have been able to find millions of music lovers here and abroad, who share similar tastes, as is evident in the success of all the artists we have worked with, including Simi who is without any doubt one of the biggest music talents in the country today…’” Since Simi’s rise to fame, she has remained a consistent talent in the music industry and has been able to gather an enviable fan base. The songstress got married to her heartthrob, Adekunle Gold in a private wedding earlier this year and has been vocal about her criticism of internet fraudsters, popularly known as yahoo boys. Simi’s earlier warning to Yahoo boys not to listen to the music of Nigerian artists sparked a debate on social media as some argued that the music industry is heavily funded by the proceeds of cybercrime.
