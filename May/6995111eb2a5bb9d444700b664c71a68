It was a match with some hype, as the Serbian’s first outing on clay after losing in Monte Carlo. Jeremy Chardy of France won the first set 6/2 while Alberto Ramos-Vinolas of Spain took a close second set 6/4. The third set was a close encounter as each player held serve for the first 11 games. Serving to stay in the match at 5-6, Alberto faced first match-point at 30-40, but saved it. The Spaniard held the two consecutive advantage points, but was denied the game. On a second match point, the Frenchman achieved the break and won the set 7/5. Marin Cilic of Croatia lost the first set 4/6 to Jan Lennard-Struff of Germany but the sixth seed found his form in the second when he held on to one break of serve to win 6/3. Struff lost his serve in the opening game of the third set and games proceeded routinely with serve and Cilic took the set 6/4 to reach the third round. In the women’s draw, the top seed, Naomi Osaka had a close shave after winning the frist set tiebreak from Spain’s Sara Sorribes Tormo. The world number one dropped the second set 6-3, but dominated the third and won it 6/1. The third seeded Simona Halep of Romania won a tight 7/5 first set in her match against Johanna Konta of Great Britain and then took the second set 6/1 from her opponent who is not comfortable on the clay surface. In other matches, Fabio Fognini defeated Britain’s Kyle Edmund 6/3, 6/4 and Argentinean strongman, Diego Schwartzman outlasted Marco Cecchinatto of Italy in a marathon 6/0, 4/6, 6/1. The upset of the day was the 4/6, 6/1, 7/6 (4) victory of Bolivia’s Hugo Dellien over France’s Gilles Simon. Hugo is 25 years old, while the 34-year-old Gilles is a veteran of many years and holder of 14 career titles after turning professional in 2002.
