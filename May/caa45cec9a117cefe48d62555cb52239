 collection from the military – their clothes are designed to help them exude power and command
 respect – it’s the same inspiration that some of the greatest artists of our time, disciplined
 performers like Michael Jackson and Beyoncé, look to for major performances. It’s a nod to the hard
 work and precision required for success.” Ugo Mozie and Ifeanyi Nwune backstage with models wearing I.N pieces The I.N. Official collection for Spring/Summer 2019 includes timeless garments such as the safari
suits and kimono, alongside fascinating designs. The brand will also premiere a short fashion
