The Ogun State Police Command Tuesday said it has foiled plans by unnamed persons to disrupt the inauguration of Dapo Abiodun as the governor of the state on May 29. The police said it has banned public processions, assemblies and rallies to “checkmate troublemakers”. “The Command has put in place a robust security arrangement aimed at checkmating such trouble makers and other criminally-minded persons, including miscreants and disgruntled elements,” command’s spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi said in a statement. “The special units of the Command, SARS, PMF, STS, Anti kidnapping, as well as DPOS and Area Commanders, have been placed on red alert with specific instruction to closely monitor  these misguided elements and respond swiftly to any distress calls and disturbance  of public peace.” The state Commissioner of Police, Bashir Makama, according to Oyeyemi, has ordered twenty-four hours surveillance patrols throughout the State. The statement advised members of the public who intend to hold public assemblies and rallies to contact the State Commissioner of Police for “necessary approval and security” in their own interest. Oyeyemi advised anyone or group with a grievance to seek alternative dispute resolution method or go to court. “The Command will not hesitate to deal decisively with anybody or group who attempts to disrupt the peace of the State no matter how highly placed such person(s) may be, as the law is no respecter of anybody,” Oyeyemi warned.
