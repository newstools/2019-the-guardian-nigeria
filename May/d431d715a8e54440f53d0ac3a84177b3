While the Peoples’ Elephant of Aba are occupying number two position in Group A of the NPFL with 25 points, having won six, drew seven and lost three games, the Flying Antelopes of Enugu are on top of the table with 31 points, after winning nine matches, drew four and lost only three fixtures. Speaking to The Guardian, yesterday, Coach Abdullah said his team is well prepared and ready for the battle, adding that teamwork, which has been their strength would see them through the epic encounter. “What has been key to our performances this season is our team spirit. Here we don’t depend on a single player; we all fight as a team and win together. That is why you probably haven’t seen a particular player scoring most of the goals because my defenders also do the scoring. “We are definitely expecting a good result in the clash because we have prepared well and ready to secure the three points by God’s grace. We are confident that the match would end in our favour,” he said. Abdullah, called on fans of the club to come out and support their team, added that the game would live up to its local derby tag. “Tomorrow’s game has a special tag on it and this has nothing to do with whether they are first or that we are second. I even heard someone describing it as the match of the season. But one thing that I know is that the match is going to be of guts and pride. That is why all eyes would be on it,” he stated.
