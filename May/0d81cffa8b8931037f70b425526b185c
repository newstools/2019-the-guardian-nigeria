The Speaker of Imo State House of Assembly, Acho Ihim,  Tuesday, tendered his resignation letter to the Clerk of the Assembly, Chris Duru. Ihim had earlier been suspended by 21 out of 27 lawmakers for absconding with the maze after reading a letter announcing the lifting of the suspension placed on the 27 Local Government chairmen by the state lawmakers. The embattled speaker was suspended alongside the majority leader, Lugard Osuji, for “conduct against the interest of the legislature.” Following his suspension, his deputy speaker resigned. But few minutes after Ihim’s resignation, a member of the House representing Ehime Mbano, Lawman Duruji, was voted in as his successor Duruji polled 14 votes to defeat Chinedu Offor who was named acting speaker immediately after Ihim’s suspension. Offor had 11 votes. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
