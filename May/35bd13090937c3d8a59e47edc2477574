 Obasanjo  Obasanjo made the observation, yesterday, in Ibadan, Oyo State, during the commissioning of an Agricultural Transformation Building and a 10.5Km ring road, at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA). The construction of the building commenced in 2017 with a foundation laying ceremony presided by former heads of government, General Yakubu Gowon, and Obasanjo; and the African Development Bank President, Dr Akinwumi Adesina as part of projects initiated to mark the 50th anniversary of IITA. Obasanjo said the country has made several policies in the past, which did not see the light of the day, due to what he called lack of implementation policy. He however, tasked Oyo State Governor, Abiola Ajimobi, IITA and Nigerian Institute of Social and Economic Research (NISER) to work towards ensuring that recommendations in the Policy Framework on agriculture are implemented by the incoming administration in the state. In his remark, Governor Ajimobi said the support given to IITA was in realisation of the importance of agriculture to the state, acknowledging the contributions of the institution to agricultural development in the state.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
