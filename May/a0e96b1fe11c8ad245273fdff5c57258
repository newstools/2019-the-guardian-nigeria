After weeks of dominating the box office and the cyberspace since its release, Avengers: Endgame has finally been knocked off the top spot by the highly anticipated John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum. The third installment of the John Wick saga was projected to pull in $56,800,000 (₦20,448,000,000) this weekend. This is Lionsgate’s highest-grossing opening weekend since 2015’s The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2. Despite being toppled from its Number one position, Endgame still had a historic weekend. According to Deadline, the $29,400,000 (₦10,584,000,000) in sales earned by Endgame adds to the domestic $770,700,000 (₦277,452,000,000) million generated since its United States premiere. That total makes it the second-highest grossing film in the domestic box office history, pushing past Avatar’s $760,500,000 (₦273,780,000,000). The Marvel smash is just $2,000,000 (₦720,000,000) away from overtaking Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The action packed follow up to John Wick’s fiasco in Rome was released in cinemas on the 17th of may 2019. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
