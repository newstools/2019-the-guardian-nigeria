 Governor Umaru Tanko Al-Makura of Nassarawa State  SERAP, in a statement yesterday signed by Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, said the governor, in a letter sent on his behalf by the state’s Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, had said that the disclosure would require more than seven days to process, given that the information being requested covers a period of eight years. SERAP had last month sent a FoI request to him and 35 other state governors as well as President Muhammadu Buhari asking them to: “provide information on specific details of spending of appropriated public funds as security votes between 2011 and 2019, given the current security realities in the country.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
