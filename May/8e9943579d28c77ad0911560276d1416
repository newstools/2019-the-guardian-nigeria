 [FILES] Nigerian Stock Exchange  According to NSE, the streamlined process, which will become effective June 1, is aimed at reducing the regulatory burden on issuer’s by eliminating duplication of processes between the SEC and NSE. “With the streamlined processes, the SEC and the NSE will carry out joint site visits of companies intending to get listed, following the registration of their securities with the SEC. “In the same vein, certain offer documents such as the Vending Agreement, Underwriting Agreement, Trust Deed and ISPO, identified to be strictly within the jurisdiction of the SEC are to be submitted only to the SEC. Also, The Exchange will rely on SEC for approval of offer documents such as a Prospectus.” The Ag. Executive Commissioner, Operations, SEC, Isiyaku Bala Tilde, said: “Streamlining the issuance process with the listing process of the NSE is a major milestone for the Commission in its quest to create an enabling environment capable of attracting new listings.” Similarly, the Executive Director, Regulation, NSE, Ms. Tinuade Awe, said: “I commend the SEC for working with us in streamlining the listing process for securities on the exchange. The NSE is much obliged for the SEC’s demonstration of a worthy example of effective collaboration all through this process in the interest of the market.” Meanwhile, the Nigerian equity market sustained its rising profile yesterday, causing the All-share index to appreciate further by 1.07 per cent.
