A man set himself on fire near the White House on Wednesday, the Secret Service said, adding that the individual was receiving first aid at the scene. The incident took place shortly after noon on the Ellipse — south of the president’s residence — near 15th Street and Constitution Avenue, the Secret Service said on Twitter. “Secret Service personnel are on scene assisting @NatlParkService and @usparkpolicepio in rendering first aid,” it said, referring to park rangers and park police.
