 Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu  It noted that Nigerians had voted him for second term because of his sincere commitment to combating terrorism, restructure the economy and create jobs as well as fight corruption. In a statement by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, the Presidency said the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), who chose to demonise and denigrate Buhari in their campaigns, must have realised that demonisation and denigration of an individual do not bring in poll dividends. According to him, from the commencement of the campaign, President Buhari had a two-pronged election strategy, which were to showcase the achievements of his administration in its first term and to cash in on his popularity with the lower rungs of the population. He said: “This is an administration that has been investing in people. “Reforms are being carried out in the justice sector with a number of domestic legislations and international agreements to facilitate the identification, tracing, freezing, recovery and forfeiture of ill-gotten assets. “The administration’s primary sectors of agriculture and solid minerals have experienced growth of 180 and 565 percentage points respectively. Nigeria has today achieved near self-sufficiency in rice production.” He also reiterated that the administration had demonstrated a single-minded commitment to upgrading and developing Nigeria’s transport, power and health infrastructure. “Road projects are ongoing across every state of the country, with many of these projects having been abandoned for many years. “The country’s narrow-gauge rail network of 3,500 kilometres is currently being upgraded; Abuja’s light rail system has been completed and commissioned,” the statement further said.
