The Nigeria Police Force said it has spent N30,000 to feed a vulture arrested alongside its owner in Maiha, Adamawa State. The Police Public Relations Officer of the command, DSP Othman Abubakar, said the command might incur more cost as it continues to detain the bird. The Commissioner of Police, Adamu Audu Madaki, on Monday, confirmed the arrest of the vulture and its owner after a member of Maiha local government reported that a woman was in custody of a certain vulture. The complainant lamented that the last time three vultures mysteriously appeared in the community, their ominous presence heralded a vicious Boko Haram attack on the community. Maiha community insisted on the eviction of the vulture and the woman from their area, hence arrest of the vulture and its owner. Both have been transferred to Yola for investigation. “We want to ascertain what the vulture is meant for,” said Madaki. Since the news of arrest of the woman and her vulture filtered members of public became curious with many peddling rumours that the vulture was a woman who turned to a bird in detention.
