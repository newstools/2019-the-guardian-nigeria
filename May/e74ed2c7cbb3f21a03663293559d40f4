The NIID is an information technology-based system that facilitates easy collation and dissemination of statistical and other information relating to insurance.
 
It also serves as a platform for easy identification of genuine insurance documents by relevant authorised persons.  Also, the NIID is connected to the database of the Vehicle Inspection Service (VIS), for easy identification of valid insurance certificates.
 
Indeed, defaulters currently pay a fine N20,000 on behalf of motorists caught by the digital camera installed by the Lagos State VIS.
 
Findings by The Guardian show that many insurance companies have already been charged by the Lagos VIS, and compelled to pay the prescribed sum for failing to upload the policies sold within 24 hours, as required by law.
   
The Director-General, Nigerian Insurers Association (NIA), Mrs. Yetunde Ilori, at a media parley in Lagos, recently, said the group has been going round to the member companies to stress the need for operators to upload their sold motor policies on the NIID platform.
 
She argued that the NIID remains one of the best ways to curb fake motor insurance policy, adding that to assist motorists to easily verify the genuineness of their policies, the industry introduced the Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) code *565*11#.
