Remember our post earlier in the day about Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s surrogate going into labour? Well, she’s given birth and it’s a boy! The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star, 38, confirmed on Twitter that she and her rapper husband have welcomed their fourth child, a son, via surrogate. “He’s here and he’s perfect!” Kardashian West tweeted. He’s here and he’s perfect! — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) May 10, 2019  He’s also Chicago’s twin lol I’m sure he will change a lot but now he looks just like her — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) May 10, 2019  We look forward to what the little champ will be named, considering KimYe are fond of queer baby names – Chicago, North and Saint. Until then, congrats to the couple!!!
