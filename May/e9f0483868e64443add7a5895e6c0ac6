Yobe State’s new governor-elect will be  Alhaji Mai Mala Buni will be sworn-in on Wednesday behind closed doors at the Government House in Damaturu, a government official said on Tuesday. Chairman of Publicity Sub-Committee for the 2019 inauguration Mala Musti, who is also Commissioner of Information, said only a handful of invitation cards were printed and issued by protocol officials as tickets to access to the Banquet Hall, venue of the inauguration ceremony. Musti disclosed this Tuesday in Damaturu, while briefing journalists on the inauguration ceremony of the Governor-elect. “This event will be held at the new Banquet Hall of Government House in Damaturu with strict control of the crowd to the venue,” he said. According to him, the Democracy Day on June 12 will be held at the August 27th Stadium, Damaturu, the state capital. He said the decision to have a lowkey inauguration was in conformity with President Muhammadu Buhari’s plan to make his own inauguration devoid of much fanfare. “As you may be aware that the inauguration and swearing-in ceremony will be low-keyed; because of the pronouncement by His Excellency, President Buhari that henceforth; Democracy Day will be celebrated on June 12, of every year,” he said.
