The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has advised candidates who sat for the 2019 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) to disregard report circulating on social media that it had released the UTME results. A statement by the board on its official Twitter handle yesterday said the results were being delayed to ensure that candidates who engaged in malpractices are duly punished. “JAMB wishes to refute claims being credited to it on the release of the 2019 UTME. Candidates are advised that the results of the 2019 UTME would be released shortly. Results of the 2019 UTME are being delayed as the board seeks to ensure that no candidate involved in any form of examination malpractice is allowed to go unpunished,” the board said.
