It is no longer ‘lies as usual’ when it comes to popular Nollywood actress, Mercy Aigbe as she has revealed that she will no longer tolerate any lies published about her in the media. The screen star disclosed that she is ready to legally challenge every false publication and has written her lawyer to that effect. According to her, she is on her way to sue a blogger who recently published lies that the father of her daughter sends money for the child’s upkeep in response to her mother’s day post that she has been playing the role of father and mother. Aigbe said, “I instructed my lawyer to write a blogger, who has made it in his/her life mission, to spread falsehood about me. The latest, being that the father of my daughter has been sending money for her upkeep. This lie is in response to the post I made on Mother’s day. I could have allowed this lie to slide but henceforth, I have made a decision to challenge every form of falsehood. I know like many media people; this particular blogger might not take me seriously. They believe there will be no consequence for spreading false news or if they beg, all will be well. I’m putting it out here to let you know that this particular blogger lied. In the past 18 years I have been solely responsible for the upkeep of my daughter if the blogger believes otherwise, he/she should come out with Proof or face the consequences! I will not toil day and night to give my children the best in life and have one unprofessional, lazy, clout chasing blogger try to paint me bad. For the records, I will be pursuing this to a legal logical conclusion and challenge every form of falsehood henceforth.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
