Tennis. PHOTO:google.com/search Former National Table Tennis Coach, Babatunde Obisanya has described the forthcoming African Cup and Club Championships, which the country would host as a good development that would positively impact the sport in the country. The events sanctioned by the African Table Tennis Federation (ATTF), and backed by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), are expected to serve as dress rehearsals for the 2019 African Games holding in Morocco later this year. Expected to feature the continent’s best, the tournaments are slated for August, and would hold at the Molade Okoya-Thomas Hall, Teslim Balogun Stadium, Surulere in Lagos. Speaking to The Guardian, yesterday, Obisanya said he was excited with the news, adding that it would give the country’s athletes more competition and the chance to play with the best from around the world. “Basically, it is a good development for sports generally and table tennis in particular. The more competitions we have, I believe the more opportunities our players would have to compete with some of the best players on the continent and at the world level. “Opportunities like these we should be able to take advantage of. I want to believe that the government once again should be able to support the federation in order to ensure we have a successful tournament in Lagos,” he said.
