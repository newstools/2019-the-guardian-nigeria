Breast pain is common and rarely a symptom of breast cancer as commonly believed. However, if you experience redness or swelling, it could be a sign of infection (particularly in breastfeeding women) and you should see a doctor ASAP. Here are some common reasons you might be experiencing sore boobs. One of the most common reasons for breast soreness is from fluctuations in your hormones the week before your period. It is possible that a rash caused by breast tissue folding over onto the skin of your chest could create a moist area where fungal infections can grow; Women with larger breasts have a much harder time getting good airflow under their breasts and are at more of a risk for itchy, red rashes. Birth control can cause changes in breast tissue by changing estrogen and progesterone levels during the menstrual cycle. These changes can change the size of someone’s breasts, and make them feel tender or sore. Simply working out your upper body too hard can affect the chest wall muscles that lie underneath your breasts. To fix this, make sure you’re wearing a supportive sports bra when you work out. This is actually more common than you think! Measure yourself and make sure you’re wearing the proper size bra to support your breasts. Wearing and carrying heavy purses or backpacks can cause rib or chest wall pain — which can be confused for breast pain. Sitting at a desk all day if you’ve got bad posture is a recipe for disaster. Poor posture and a poor work set up at your desk can cause strain and pain in your chest. Yet another thing your hormones could be behind! The fluctuation between estrogen and progesterone that are preparing your breast for milk production could cause tenderness. This can even happen as early as two weeks after conception.
