We all think that a bowl of fruits and vegetables is the best kind of meal anyone can have. So we go ahead to chop all the fruits and vegetables that our refrigerator has, squeeze a lime, add a dash of salt and we believe it to be the healthiest. But, the reverse is the case. Acidic, sweet or neutral –these are the categories your fruits and vegetables should fall under when mixing, if not, then you have been getting your salads all wrong. The first lesson to note, you shouldn’t mix fruits and vegetables together because of these two digests differently. Fruits have a quicker pace of digestion and in fact, many nutritionists say that they are partially digested by the time they reach the stomach. Also, fruits have more sugar content which is something that can hinder the digestive process of vegetables. For the same reason, one shouldn’t mix orange with carrot; they may cause heartburn and excess bile reflux. Another important thing to note is to avoid mixing acidic fruits, such as grapefruits and strawberries, or sub-acidic foods such as apples, pomegranates and peaches, with sweet fruits like bananas and raisins for better digestion; however, acidic with sub-acidic fruits make a good mixture. Similarly, you should avoid the guava-banana mixture because some studies claim that the duo can even increase your chances of nausea, acidosis and headaches. Nonetheless, if you feel like you have mistakenly made the wrong choices with fruits or your diet in general, here are quick fruit fixes to try: Over-eaten salt? Have a water-based fruit, like watermelon, the next morning to flush out the salt. Consumed excess carbs, like pasta? Have an apple the next morning, do some exercise to break the complex carbs that an apple contains too. This helps prevent bloating which may otherwise be caused by simple carbs like the ones in pasta.
