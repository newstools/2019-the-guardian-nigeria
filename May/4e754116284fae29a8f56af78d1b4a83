Twenty four-year-old Miss Benjamin Ruth is in dire need of N600,000 for corrective surgery on her swollen face. Ruth, whose education was put on hold after the pain caused by the swelling became unbearable, was at The Guardian on Wednesday alongside her uncle, Ande Joseph to seek help from the public. According to a medical report from the Lagos State Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Idi-Araba, signed by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, Prof. W.L. Adeyemo, “Clinical examination revealed marked facial asymmetry secondary to a right maxillary mass crossing the midline and deviation of the nose to the left. Patient is being worked up for maxillectomy under general anaesthesia, but surgery is urgently required to stop the swelling.” According to Ruth who lost her father after the illness surfaced, said she discovered a swelling on her face that came in form of a boil in 2014 but rather than go away, it grew into the size of a lawn tennis ball, which increased by each passing day. Her uncle said: “When the family was preparing to get money for her treatment, we lost her father and her treatment suffered for a long while. Presently, she can’t do anything, or go to the farm because we are farmers, and we don’t have the financial muscle to foot the bill.” Her details are: Ruth Benjamin, Fidelity Bank 6322093695.
