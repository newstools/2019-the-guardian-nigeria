Lil Kesh, formerly signed to Olamide’s YBNL,  had quite a good second half of 2018 after a slightly dry 2017. He featured on a couple of mega-hits like Chinko Ekun’s ‘Able God’ and delivered an impressive  verse on Zlatan’s ‘Jogor.’ Kesh later released the infamous ‘Logo Benz’ that unfortunately draws inferences between wealth obtained through fetish means, internet fraud and the ‘pant stealing’ pandemic of the final quarter of 2018. Now, he has teased fans with an unreleased collaboration that features Mayorkun titled, ‘Nkan Be’ and it feels like it could garner major airplay, if not become an instant hit. In fact, his fellow artists such as Mr. Eazi and Zlatan have urged him to drop the song. While we await the official release of ‘Nkan Be’ which is said to be a post-breakup song, watch Kesh’s teaser below:   Was going through my unreleased songs and found NKAN BE freestyle with mayor A post shared by  YAGI  (@lilkeshofficial) on May 6, 2019 at 11:36am PDT
