The group promoted by a rights activist and lawyer, Chief Malcom Omirhobo filed the action before a Federal High Court, Abuja. Respondents in the suit are the Federal Government, the President, the Attorney General of the Federation, Minister of Interior, National Assembly, Inspector General of Police and Accountant General of the Federation as first to seventh defendants in the suit respectively. The suit, the plaintiff said is brought pursuant to Order 3 Rules 6,7 and 9 of the Federal High Court Civil Procedure Rule 200 asking the court for interpretation of laws and make orders retraining the FG from taking monies from federation account to pay Fulani herdsmen. Also, the plaintiff wants court to interpret section 80 (2), (3)and (4) of the 1999 Constitution as to when monies could be withdrawn from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Federation, where such is not authorises by an Appropriation Act or Supplementary Act by the 5th defendant. The plaintiff is asking to court to determine: “Whether the combined interpretation or construction of section 1(1) section 80 (1) (2),(4), (81)(1),83 (1)(2) of the 1999 Constitution, the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 6th defendant can withdraw from the federation account or any other public fund belonging to the Federal government to pay the sum of N100 billion or any sum at all to the Fulani Militia/herdsmen through their socio cultural group, the Mayetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) without recourse to the 5th defendant in compliance with the provisions of the Nigerian Constitution.” The plaintiff therefore wants court to restrain the defendants from disbursing the N100billion from Federal Account or any other public funds to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 6th defendants for payment to the armed Fulani herdsmen. In alternative, the plaintiff wants court to direct the defendants to make laws creating state and local police for the peace, order and good governance.
