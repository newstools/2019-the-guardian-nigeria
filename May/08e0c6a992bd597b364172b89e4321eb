From 5G to internet of things, OPPO is constantly innovative, one of the reasons we are launching the F11 Pro in Nigeria is to mark a major step which is OPPO coming into the market to make a bold statement. During the product presentation, the brand’s key opinion leaders (KOLs), Anny Robert, a paramount professional photographer, Do2dtun (Oladotun Ojuolape Kayode), popular OAP and Bamike (Bambam) Olawunmi former BBNaija housemate, all came up to speak about their personal experiences with the phone. After using the phone to take some pictures, Anny described the OPPO F11 Pro as “that device that shoots portrait pictures just like a DSLR camera. The camera quality and its features are second to none, I’ve never seen anything like it on any smartphone. I was impressed with the 48MP+5MP dual rear camera setup, especially the F1.79 aperture.” “Its performance in low light conditions is very impressive! The camera sensor can increase the area of a single photosensitive unit by four times in low-light conditions, to significantly improve the light-sensing capability and capture more details. It’s an experience you need to have to understand this mind-blowing feat,” he added. “The OPPO F11 Pro is super fast and is built to give users an outstanding performance; fast charging, not lagging, not heating up while in heavy or moderate use, superior gaming experience, and a long battery life to ensure you’re always in power,” says Do2tun. Bambam spoke about the beauty of the phone, its unique colour gradient and design, “ever since I started using the OPPO F11 Pro, I always standout anywhere I go, people always stare at it because they’ve seen nothing well designed and as beautiful as this before.” The event was a good avenue to show the OPPO F11 Pro as a well-rounded phone – beautiful and aesthetically pleasing, one with an amazing camera that shoots brilliant portrait in low light and most importantly a high-performance device with high battery capacity, good RAM and an unbeatable user experience. The F11 series comes with a 48MP+5MP dual rear camera setup, offers 48MP ultra-clear images, and enables users to take perfect low-light portraits by using Ultra Night Mode and Dazzle Color Mode features with a 1/2.3-inch 48MP image sensor.The phone features a hidden front camera design that rises when the selfie camera is launched, offering the user a panoramic full screen.
