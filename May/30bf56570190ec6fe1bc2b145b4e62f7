Huawei said the restriction will also harm the interests of US companies and consumers. “Unreasonable restrictions will infringe upon Huawei’s rights and raise other serious legal issues,” it added. Huawei has made substantial contributions to the development and growth of Android around the world. As one of Android’s key global partners, it said it has worked closely with their open-source platform to develop an ecosystem that has benefitted both users and the industry. The Chinese tech giant buys about $67 billion worth of components each year, including about $11 billion from US suppliers, according to The Nikkei business daily. Huawei is the target of an intense campaign by Washington, which has been trying to persuade allies not to allow China a role in building next-generation 5G mobile networks. “Huawei will continue to provide security updates and after sales services to all existing Huawei and Honor smartphone and tablet products covering those have been sold or still in stock globally.” Chinese telecoms giant said it will continue to build a safe and sustainable software ecosystem, in order to provide the best experience for all users globally.
