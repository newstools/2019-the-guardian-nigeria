The Kano State House of Assembly has passed into law a bill that grants life pension and other benefits to the speaker and deputy speaker of the House. The Pension Rights of Speaker and Deputy Law 2019  affords the two presiding officers privilege to earn life benefit after the expiration of their tenure. The two presiding officers are to enjoy annual medical trips and brand new vehicles of choice every four years. However,  any speaker or deputy speaker who leaves his position through impeachment is not entitled to the benefits. “There shall be paid pension to person(s) who held office as speaker and deputy speaker equal to the emoluments of a serving speaker and deputy speaker, provided that either the Speaker or the Deputy do not hold any paid elective or selective appointments,” part of the law reads. “Any person duly elected as Speaker or Deputy Speaker shall, on completion of his term be entitled to a grant of pension for life by the state, provided that such person was not removed from office through impeachment by members of the House of Assembly. “Where the Speaker or Deputy vacates office before the expiration of the term of his office, not as a result of impeachment, he shall be paid pension pro-rata the number of years he spent in relation to his tenure of office” The assembly in 2018 rejected a similar bill that sought to provide life pension to the governor and deputy governor in the state. Led by the former speaker and member representing Fagge constituency, Abdullahi Atta, the lawmakers insisted the executive bill may not be considered due to economic recession bedevilling the country with severe impact in Kano.
