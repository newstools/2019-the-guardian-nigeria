Rev. Yakubu Pam • Fight For Release Of Chibok Girls, Leah 
The re-elected Chairman of the 19 Northern States of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Reverend Yakubu Pam, has promised to fight tooth and nail to put an end to the persecution of Christians in northern Nigeria. Reverend Pam added that he would consolidate on what was achieved during his first tenure and ensured there was right of worship and freedom of religious practice. He said the issue of Christians’ inability to acquire land would be tackled during his second tenure of three years. On the issue of recurrent crises in the state, he said some crises do not have religious colouration, but were unfortunately turned against Christians, which is condemnable. The chairman also said his team would ensure that the remaining Chibok girls in Boko Haram’s captivity were released, while still clamouring for Leah Sharibu’s release. He, however, commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his intervention in securing Zainab Aliyu’s release, as she was wrongly accused of drug peddling in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, urging him to do the same for other captives. Pam charged security operatives in the state to intensify efforts at averting farmer/herder clashes. He said: “It is like we are not in control of our borders, and when a country is not in control of her borders, the citizens are in a very big trouble. We should be able to control our borders, know who goes out and comes in. The army should also sit up to do the needful, particularly in some of our forests…” He condemned the recent Bassa and Barkin Ladi attacks, pointing out that it is not good for anyone to take the lives of others, which can trigger reprisals.
