 Tax  “The more tax we pay, the more the returns to our stakeholders diminish. If you are to pay tax on claims and on management expenses, what this means is that you have little or nothing left to pay dividend to shareholders,” he said. 
 
However, there was an ongoing discussion between NIA and FIRS to try to address this challenge.
 
Last year, the General Manager, Retail Life, AIICO Insurance Plc, Sola Ajayi, said the tax code in Nigeria is too hard on both life and non-life insurance companies, as they were not allowed to take advantage of deferred tax, especially, for life business.
 
“We cannot take advantage of those taxed assets because of Section 33 and Section 16 of the tax code. Section 33 is saying, we must pay minimum tax, while Section 16 is saying, even when you have a tax exempt income, you must pay something.
 
“So, you cannot exempt paying tax on the life business where some are even incurring losses and you cannot fully take advantage of all your reliefs,” he said. 
 
For non-life business, he said, the tax code does not recognise the whole claims paid as expense, noting that, no matter the claims you paid, you can only relief 25 per cent of it.
 
According to him, “if you pay claims of any amount, the law does not allow claims as expenses, it only allow 25 per cent of it. So, why are we in operation? Is it not to pay claims?” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
