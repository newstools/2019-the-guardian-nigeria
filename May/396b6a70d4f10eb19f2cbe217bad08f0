Security officials at Kuje Medium Security Prison have apprehended one Clement Jacob of Deidei village in Abuja for attempting to smuggle substances suspected to be Indian hemp into the prison facility. “The substance which was hidden in a sandal was expected to be delivered to one Emeka Onyejikacki, an inmate of Kuje prison who is in custody for a case of possession of hard drugs,” the prison’s public relations officer Chukwuedo Humphrey said in a statement. “Mr Jacob ran out of luck when he exchanged his sandals with that of the inmate after his session of prison visit,” he added. He further stated that Jacob was fished out by the officer in charge of the visit area Inspector Hussain Ibrahim who noticed the quick exchange of footwear and requested for another search after the visiting session was over. Humphrey said inspector Hussain carefully tore open the foot of the sandals thereby exposing the illegal substance. He said Jacob not to know Husain, stating that one Mrs Emeka had called him to assist her in paying Mr Emeka a visit. He was also instructed to exchange his footwear with the inmate before leaving the premises. “The Controller of Prisons pledged the commitment of the officers and men of the Command to rid Prisons in the command of illicit transactions that are capable of compromising security and discipline in the Service,” Humphrey noted.
