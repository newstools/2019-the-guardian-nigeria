Yesterday, we reported the news of the exit of Mavin Records first lady, Tiwa Savage from the label after seven years of being signed on. Following the confirmation that the multiple award-winning songstress had indeed signed with the international record label, Universal Music Group, Don Jazzy had taken to social media to praise her with an emotional post. Reacting to the post by Don Jazzy to Savage’s exit from his label, Nigerian singer turned Instagram sensation, Tunde Ednut had said Don Jazzy must have made a lot of money off Savage. Ednut wrote, “Chai! For a record label boss to write this kind thing for an artist that’s departing its record label, chai! JAZZY MADE SOME GOOD MONEY ���. I have never seen this kind of good departing message from a record label before in this Nigeria, walahi! All record labels dey vex when artist dey leave and they might FIGHT!!!” However, in his reaction to Ednut’s post, Don Jazzy revealed that he and Savage have come a long way and also  disclosed that the “One” crooner was asked to leave Mavin Records four years ago but she chose to stay back and grow the brand. He further disclosed that his love for her is forever. He wrote; “Lol Tunde it’s not about money jor. Tiwa too sabi. Respect is reciprocal. Na since 4 years people don Dey disturb her to leave Mavin but she stayed and helped grow what we were collectively building. My love for her no fit shake for life.” Savage is currently considered the leading female African musicians and to her credit she has several chart-topping songs and has also been able to blaze a path for other females as well as male artists to follow.
