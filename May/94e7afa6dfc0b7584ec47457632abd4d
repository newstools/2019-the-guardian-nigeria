Afrobeat sensation Damini Ogulu popularly known as Burna Boy has recently shared another one of his unpopular opinions but this time he addressed overrated artists and streaming numbers. The Dangote crooner took to instastories to address artists who tied their success and relevance to the analytics from online streaming platforms with the caption; “This Streaming Shit be making people think they’re Talented. If joke tings like “Baby Shark” and “Gangnam style” can do more numbers than Everyone, Don’t think you are Talented or Respected cuz of your Streaming numbers. Everyone with real working brains know What is a Joke and what is real. Anyway plenty talk no Dey full basket. Let Time reveal All.”  which came shortly after DMW’s Mayorkun posted a photo on Instagram celebrating 70 million streams on his debut solo album “The Mayor Of Lagos”. Mayorkun Celebratory Post Burna Boy Streaming Instastory Barely one week ago, Burna Boy was in the spotlight for criticizing artites that sign international deals with foreign record labels and music management agencies around the same time Tiwa Savage announced her new deal with Universal Music so this most recent commentary on streaming numbers shortly after Mayorkun’s celebratory post is signaling some sort of pattern which many consider to be negative and toxic.
