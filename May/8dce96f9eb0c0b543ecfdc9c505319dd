The PGAN pact with PGAs of Europe will pave the way for Nigeria’s top stars like Andrew Oche Odoh to join the global train. The Professional Golfers Association of Nigeria (PGAN) quest to join the elite group of the noble game has received a boost with the agreement by Professional Golfers Associations of Europe (PGAs of Europe) to join the crusade to raise the standard of the country’s game. Representatives of the PGAs of Europe will arrive in Nigeria today to begin a five-day meeting with PGAN officials, which will culminate in both bodies signing a developmental pact. According to PGAN Secretary, Jide Bolaji, the European will be in Nigeria from today to May 29 to deliberate with their Nigerian counterparts on education, including advice and links to available funding and capacity building, among others. “The PGA of Nigeria is not relenting on its oars to see that members (professional players) make the best out of the profession like their counterparts in other climes,” Bolaji said, adding, “this is the reason we are members of big bodies as the PGAs Europe; and as their member, it is mandatory they visit Nigeria to see how we are faring in the profession. “They will be looking at areas of PGA education, talk about the ongoing PGA of Nigeria Qualifying school, opportunities that abound for professionals in terms of professional golf development in Nigeria. “In this regard, they will be looking at capacity building for PGA of Nigeria members and the incoming ones, the area of financial opportunities from international bodies towards developing golf in Nigeria will also be explored and the need for Nigeria to become a member of the World Golf Alliance, which is the highest body of professional golf in the world.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
