 Imo State governor-elect, Emeka Ihedioha  Imo state gubernatorial candidate of the Democratic Alternative (AD), Emeka Ihejirika, filed the suit on the basis of election malpractice. The judge, P.A Rimgim, in his verdict said the plaintiff lacks the right to file the suit, adding that the court does not have the jurisdiction to hear cases on post-election matters. “Apart from the Federal High Court lacking the jurisdiction to entertain the suit, it was an abuse of court processes. That was why the court slammed N5 million cost against the plaintiffs. It is as simple as that.” The judge said while giving his verdict. On this account, the judge dismissed the case. He also slammed the plaintiff with a N5 million fine. Reacting to the outcome of the verdict, Ihedioha, said he is ready to work with the people of the state as from May 29. He added that the victory is not his but the peoples’. He defeated his opponent, Uche Nwosu of Action Alliance (AA),  and who was the son-in-law of the incumbent governor of the state, Rochas Okorocha with 273,404 votes.
