 Brainiacs STEM and Robotics celebrated kids with special needs  The team of Brainiacs STEM and Robotics alongside its partners, which included Clifford Ajefo, Bisola and Racheal Inegbedion, engaged the kids on virtual reality sessions. Virtual reality allows the user to explore and interact with a three-dimensional (3-D) computer-simulated environment in a seemingly real or physical way, typically using special electronic equipment. Brainiacs STEM and Robotics is an Edtech organization that develops children and young adults with supplemental skills in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), thus giving them the skills and motivation they need to create a better future. Rose Mordi, president of the Down Syndrome Foundation Nigeria stated the session was an opportunity to improve the technology and educational skills for the children’s developmental milestone. Racheal Inegbedion, a promoteur of the community project and Team Lead of ARPG Tech & Initiative for National Growth Africa, emphasized the essence of introducing affordable virtual reality-based methods to the kids to enhance the educational and training medium for special needs children so they can develop their hidden talents into useful and practical strengths. No words could describe the happiness felt by the special children – and the satisfaction gained by the enablers – when their dreams came true through a simulated environment whether it is to visit the pyramids, go for a hike on top of the highest mountains or just watch dinosaurs come alive from billions of years ago.
