 Chief Executive Officer, Bovibes Entertainment Organisation, Boco Ibe  Speaking at the grand finale of creative talent hunt event held at Ajah Lagos, Ibe said creative industry has the capacity to engage youths and divert their attention from restiveness. Ibe said that the Bovibes Arts Factory, which was launched at the event, is meant to inspire, motivate and develop creative talents of students in secondary schools in Nigeria and is also willing to partner Federal Government to reciprocate the initiative in all the six geo-political regions. He observed that the higher institutions system is designed in such a way to keep producing graduates who are job seekers rather than job creators. According to him, one of the ways to harness human capital development in Nigeria is to catch young talents.
Ibe said he was fulfilling a lifelong dream of his own to contribute to the development of Nigerian youths. “I am so glad we finally made this happen. The future of Nigeria is extremely bright if we manage to nurture our youths and come through. I have seen some potential from series of activities like comedy, singing and drumming from their performances. I learned so much today about the strength, resilience, innovation and creativity of these bright youths,” he noted. He disclosed that the gesture is part of social corporate responsibility of Bovibes entertainment. National creative arts talent hunt director, Mr Peterson Agwu disclosed that the platform gives room for students regardless of their background, tribe and status to showcase their creative talents and make a living for themselves. Agwu disclosed that the talents hunt idea was birthed to encourage youths to develop their talents to escape unemployment.
