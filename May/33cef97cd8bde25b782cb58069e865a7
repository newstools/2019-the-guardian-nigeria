Bolton made his accusation that the four ships were hit by “naval mines almost certainly from Iran” while in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi to discuss what he says is the threat from Tehran. “There’s no doubt in anybody’s mind in Washington who’s responsible for this,” Bolton said in a clear reference to Iran. The accusation comes amid a US military buildup in the Gulf and on the eve of emergency Arab and Gulf summits called by Iran’s regional rival Saudi Arabia to discuss the standoff. It also comes two days after President Donald Trump struck a dovish tone during a visit to Japan saying that Washington was not seeking “regime change” in Iran and was open to talks. Bolton said US reinforcements were sent to the region as a “deterrent” and Washington’s response would be prudent.
