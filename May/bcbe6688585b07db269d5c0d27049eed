Mavin Records has recently released their first all-star track of the year titled “All Is In Order” which features Don Jazzy, Rema, Korede Bello, DNA Twins and Crayon and it is accompanied by a colourful hype video. This is coming after the label had some major restructuring motivated in part by the exit of notable artists like Tiwa Savage Reekado Banks. Like the title suggests “All Is In Order” is somewhat of a subtle message to the public that as far as the Mavin’s are concerned, all is in order. The video was shot and directed by Clarence Peters in Lagos, Nigeria and is an altogether eccentric video that highlights each of the artists in different parts of an island delivering their verses seamlessly but with finesse. The artistes were styled by Nkem Juma, Chisom Njoku, Joseph Usiagwu, Sindara from The NOJ company and Henri Uduku. Watch “All Is In Order” via YouTube below;
