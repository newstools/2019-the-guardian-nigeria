Niger Bridge. PHOTO: NAN Julius Berger Nigeria Plc has said the tremendous progress made in the construction of the second Niger Bridge project in such a short time, reflects the company’s continued commitment to timely completion of the project. The Bridge, which is expected to be completed by the Year 2022, according to the Managing Director of the company, Dr Lars Richter, is currently undergoing an extensive engineering construction work since it was awarded the main contract for the works. Reviewing its performance during the firm’s Investors Relations Forum, in Lagos, recently, Richter explained that the cold recycling methodology, Julius Berger introduced in the ongoing Abuja/Kaduna/Zaria/Kano Road, points to an efficient future for road construction, rehabilitation and maintenance in Nigeria. He explained that the methodology provides for the milled-off pavement to be recycled and improved for reuse in paving the base layer of the road.
Speaking on the Lagos-Shagamu Expressway, which witnessed some delays and even work stoppage in the past, due to funding challenges, Richter said since the resumption of work, a steady pace of progress is now the reality. He said: “Considering that the expressway is now financed via the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund, we presume that we will be able to achieve an uninterrupted pace of work with the new funding structure.” On the ongoing Bodo/Bonny Road, Richter said despite the project’s strategic socio-economic importance and acknowledged challenges, “as the first major contractor to enter Bonny Island in over 20 years, Julius Berger has the experience and the technical knowhow to deliver the needed solution, and we are doing so.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
