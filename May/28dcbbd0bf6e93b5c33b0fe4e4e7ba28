He said, ‘Operation Puff Adder’ was to intensify operations in and around the state to drive out all criminal elements from their hideouts. “It will consolidate our achievements in recent times. With Operation Puff Adder, law abiding citizens and residents have a lot to gain,” he stated. Dandaura said that launching the operation in Okpoko division was significant, given the economic activities and dense population of the area, which makes the area susceptible to high criminal activities. He commended Governor Willie Obiano for supporting the police in its operations and sister agencies for synergising with the police. Speaking, Obiano, who was represented by Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Professor Solo Chukwulobelu, commended the IGP for the initiative, which he said, would encourage peace in Anambra. Meanwhile, the Nigerian Red Cross Society (NRCS) has urged the Federal Government to establish a National Reconciliation Ministry in Nigeria to enhance peaceful coexistence and encourage youth volunteer groups to participate in humanitarian activities. Anambra State Chairman of NRCS, Professor Peter Emeka Katchy, stated this at its Amawbia headquarters yesterday, saying when established, the ministry would help enthrone national rebirth, values and patriotism. He stated this while fielding questions from newsmen during the flagging-off of a one-week medical outreach, as part of activities to mark the 2019 World Red Cross Day. Katchy stressed that the occasion was to remember founder of the organisation, Jean Henry Dunant, who was born on May 8, 1828 in Geneva, Switzerland, adding that the day was held simultaneously globally. He added that it was also in recognition and honour of volunteers all over the world covering 187 member nations and over 250 million supporters. On this year’s theme: Love for Humanity, Prof. Katchy said the NRCS has made significant impacts, especially in Anambra where it has resolved conflicts in Anambra West, Umuchukwu Community, as well as Aguleri and Umuleri crisis.
