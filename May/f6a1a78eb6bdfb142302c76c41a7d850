Director-general of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) Shuaibu Ibrahim has warned Nigerian tertiary institutions against graduating unqualified students to take part in the scheme. “Corps-producing institutions are warned not to enrol unqualified graduates into the mobilisation process of the scheme,” Ibrahim said while addressing NYSC’s deployment and relocation officers from tertiary institutions at a workshop held in Abuja. Ibrahim said it was disappointing that the compulsory scheme meant for qualified students to serve their country have been populated by a few individuals for fraudulent means. The DG, who warned tertiary institutions against enrolling unqualified students, said such schools would be barred from registering students for the compulsory one-year scheme. He said the agency is eager to serve its sanctions on higher institution found to be involved in fraudulent mobilisation of unqualified graduates to serve as a deterrent to others. “I advise all of you, participants, not to fall into the temptation of unscrupulous elements that may want to truncate the mobilisation process. The NYSC will blacklist any corps-producing institution that is involved in fraudulent mobilisation of unqualified graduates in order to serve as a deterrent to others,” Ibrahim said. He urged the officers to “do the right thing. Let us maintain good integrity and check your data correctly.” Ibrahim assured that batch B corps members that their monthly allowance would be increased to N30,000, to align with the new minimum wage signed by Nigeria president Muhammadu Buhari in April.
