30-year-old singer, Chris Brown has been in a lot of trouble with the law in recent times that he could surely use some good news in his life right now! And who knows, the good news may even be here already and we just don’t know about it yet! According to several speculations, the Grammy award-winning singer may very well be on his way to becoming a father for the second time. The rumours started after the “Undecided” crooner dropped a comment on his rumored girlfriend, Ammika Harris‘ Instagram pictured that seemed to indicate he was calling her a “baby mama”. 25-year-old Harris in the photo can be seen holding a basketball while smiling and posing in front of a basketball set-up in an arcade room. In his first comment, Brown wrote, “Yup,” and then dropped a second that reads, “BM BAD”. Fans were quick to dissect what “BM” could mean and it turns out that most people seem to use those letters to refer to the term “baby mama”. With this speculation, should we be expecting to say congratulations to Brown in some few months because fans are already sharing their enthusiasm about the possibility that the beauty could be pregnant with Brown’s baby? Brown has famously dated pop star, Rihanna and reality TV star and aspiring model, Karrueche Tran. He currently has a daughter, Royalty whom he constantly flaunts on his social media page and adores.
