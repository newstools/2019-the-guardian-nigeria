Cisco, global technology leader, has reinforced its commitment to support the digitization of Africa’s communities, businesses and governments through several initiatives for skills and talent development, innovation and job creation. Cisco is set to launch a new Repair Centre, train one million new members of Cisco NetAcad and introduce Cisco Edge in Nigeria. The company made these plans known in a statement released in Lagos. By investing in repair centres in Nigeria, Cisco intends to contribute to job creation and skills development. The new repair centre will work as a partner program which aims to work with selected distributors who will repair and restore Cisco hardware and make high quality, refurbished technology accessible, especially for small and medium sized organizations. In addition to repair, Cisco intends for the centers to carry out testing, quality engineering, fulfillment, process management and procurement, as well as inventory control, serving Cisco’s customers in Nigeria. Commenting on the partner repair program, Olakunle Oloruntimehin, General Manager Nigeria and West African Countries, Cisco said, “ we are living in a world that is changing faster than ever imagined. “We are inspired by the prospect of an economy with abundant jobs, a place where entrepreneurs can thrive. Our goal is to enable small and medium businesses to accelerate their growth by helping them access our world class technology”. “Our goal is to create value through ‘glocal’ manufacturing and channel models. By glocal, we mean utilizing global manufacturing practices with local execution. We look forward to a Nigeria where everyone will have access to technology and utilize it for the growth of the economy”, Olakunle Oloruntimehin added. The repair centre is part of Cisco’s vision to have technology enable inclusion and opportunities for people, wherever they live and whatever their condition. For more than 20 years, Cisco has invested in educating and upskilling students, graduates and unemployed youth through its Networking Academy (NetAcad). NetAcad provides students hands-on digital skills to prepare them for careers in the digital economy. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
