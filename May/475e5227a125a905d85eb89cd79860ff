 Ahmad Lawan  Lawan, who is seen as Apc’s anointed candidate, is contesting Senate President’s position in an election that slated for June 11, 2019.He spoke yesterday during the 15 minutes screening of President Muhammadu Buhari’s nominee for President of Customary Court of Appeal, FCT Abuja, Justice Abaze Abubakar Sadiq. It all started when Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, who presided over plenary, read Buhari’s letter seeking Senate’s approval for the nominee. Ekweremadu had opened the floor for questioning but none of the lawmakers asked Justice Sodiq a question.Rather, Shehu Sani (Kaduna-PRP) and Barau Jibrin (Kano-APC) rose to commend Justice Sadiq for what they described as his ‘befitting’ resume and avowed ‘competence.’ Lawan said the judiciary was expected to be firm, fair and committed to the ideals that the country’s founding fathers worked and died for.“Ours is a society where people who have so much money buy judgements. I think that is not the type of society that we want. “We want a society where those at the lowest line; the vulnerable and disadvantage, can go to court and get judgement because they deserve the judgements regardless of their socio-economic status.“So, I pray that this nomination we are going to confirm will be a blessing and an additional advantage to the judiciary and this great country,” he added. In what could be called record time confirmation, the lawmakers, after standing down their rules to accommodate Sadiq’s confirmation, did not ask him any question as it is usually the case, before he was eventually confirmed.
