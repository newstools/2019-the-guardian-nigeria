 Popular Nigerian music star, Davido who undoubtedly been one of the most vocal celebrities about the Nigerian elections has reacted to the report that his uncle, Senator Ademola Adeleke, was arrested by men of the Nigeria Police Force yesterday, May 6th.   The news of Adeleke’s arrest was made known in a statement released by the spokesperson of the Nigeria Police Force, Frank Mba. In the statement, Mba said:   “Senator Adeleke is currently in police custody. He was taken into custody in the evening of today 6th May 2019 in connection with ongoing criminal investigations touching on his person.   “Meanwhile, in the best tradition of natural justice and fair hearing, he has already been served with the relevant charge sheet containing his alleged offenses in the presence of his Attorneys. He will be arraigned in a competent court of law tomorrow, 7th May 2019.”   In a series of post on his Instagram page, Davido condemned the arrest of his uncle while also saying he has given up on Nigeria’s democracy. According to the singer, arresting his uncle is tantamount to criminalising an election win in the country. He also urged his uncle to stay strong because God is the only one that has a say. It would be recalled that an election tribunal declared Adeleke the winner of Osun State’s 2018 gubernatorial election after he challenged the initial declaration of Gboyega Oyetola as the winner. However, Adeleke is being alleged to have forged his West African Examinations Council’S (WAEC0) result hence the alleged criminal charges against him.
