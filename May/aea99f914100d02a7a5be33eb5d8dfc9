 Police Area Commander, Mushin, Lagos, Aliko Dankoli during his visit to The Guardian’s Corporate Head Office in Lagos… yesterday 						             PHOTO: SUNDAY AKINLOLU  Dankoli, an Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), gave the assurance when he paid a courtesy visit to The Guardian headquarters at Rutam House, Oshodi-Isolo, Lagos, yesterday. The Area Commander, who resumed duty at the Command last Monday, stated that under his watch, the police would serve law-abiding citizens in the area diligently. “I am here to serve every law-abiding citizen within my area of responsibility wholeheartedly. My phone lines are open. I will not be tired of receiving complaints and any complaint I receive I will take action,” he noted. He said he would consult with the state Commissioner of Police, Zubairu Muazu, to develop workable strategies to tackle growing acts of lawlessness and criminality between the Toyota and Five Star axis of the Oshodi-Apapa Expressway. He, however, noted that a permanent solution to the problem would need the input of the Lagos State government. Earlier, a member of the Editorial Board and former editor of The Guardian, Mr. Martins Oloja, narrated to the police chief the ordeals of members of staff of the company in the hands of hoodlums. Oloja said: “This problem is not new at all. It spans over a decade. We have published several stories about it but there seems to be no respite. The state government and the security agencies need to work together to bring sanity to this axis. So, please take up this issue with the state government. It is not just about The Guardian but about restoring sanity in this area.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
