 FrieslandCampina WAMCO  Peak said the campaign is aimed at creating a counterculture through series of experiential and media-led activities, which reinforces the breakfast custom. The awareness campaign stormed key cities in Lagos, Edo, Enugu, Anambra, Abuja, and Oyo states, where children were surprised and served with sumptuous breakfast banquets during the Children’s Day parades across Nigeria. Commenting on the campaign, Marketing Manager, Peak Milk, Maureen Ifada, said in a statement, “A lot of working-class Nigerians do not bother about having breakfast and most of those who do often do not find the time. “ Therefore, in our steadfastness to supporting Nigerians to be unstoppable, our brand is committed to cultivating a breakfast tradition, which sets the tone of your day, from start to finish.” Ifada said by choosing a balanced breakfast, people can get off to the right start and fill-in the gaps likely to be missing in their diet. “Milk is a perfect breakfast complement, as it remains one of the richest natural sources of vitamins and minerals; enhancing growth and development of mental and physical performance. So, enjoy a Peak breakfast today – your guaranteed enabler to start well and end well.” Also, as a tribute to the local dairy farmers, whose raw milk is purchase and used in the production of Peak Milk, executives from FrieslandCampina WAMCO, and Nutrition Society of Nigeria (NSN) visited and served breakfast to dairy farmers and pastoralists in Iseyin and neighbouring communities in Oyo State. Being pioneers of the Dairy Development Programme (DDP) in Nigeria, the Peak brand prides itself as a product being sourced through an initiative, which emphasises gender inclusion and is significantly improving food and nutrition security in the country.
