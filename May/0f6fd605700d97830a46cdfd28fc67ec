Kano State House of Assembly Wednesday green-lighted the amendment of the local government and chieftaincy affairs law, paving way for the decentralisation of the Kano emirate council. The law will now allow for the creation of four more first class emirs in the state, which include Rano, Karaye, Bichi and Gaya emirates. The Guardian had earlier reported that the Kano State governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has promised to speed up the signing of the bill proposed to upgrade four district heads into first class emirs into law. A source said the governor may sign the bill into law later on Wednesday. “I am ready to sign the bill into Law without any waste of time because we believe it is a popular wish of our people – The people of Kano state,” Abba Anwar, Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, said in a statement on Wednesday. “This will also go a long way in hastening growth and development for the state,” he added. The Kano assembly amended the law following a petition filled before the house by one Ibrahim Chambers. The petitioner demanded the upgrade of some traditional rulers to the status of first class emirs. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
