 Airtel Office  According to an analyst, Jude Fajoku, “Free float worldwide is all about quantity of shares and not about market valuation. Let us go back to the basics. The NSE should remove this rule amendment immediately, ‘the value of its free float is equal to or above N40 billion on the date The Exchange receives the Issuer’s application to list.’  
 
“The price of a company’s stock should not be brought into the free float discussion. The core and only matter should be number of shares freely available to trade relative to total outstanding shares. Amend the rules so that any company with an intended or expected listing market value in excess of $500 million (N180billion), can only list by IPO. Listing by Introduction will not be allowed for companies with listing valuation expected to exceed $500 million. The NSE and SEC should never have approved a listing for MTN by introduction. The regulators had the leverage as this is an involuntary listing and they let it go to waste! 
 
“MTN Nigeria is dominating the Nigerian telecom industry; has a dominant stake on the NSE (20%), and is dominating the headlines in scandals ranging from disobeying regulatory directives, exporting cash to its parent market without required documentation and underpaying taxes by $2 billion to the Nigerian tax authority. MTN Nigeria has sued the Attorney-General of Nigeria for N3 billion in regards to the underpayment of taxes accusation. The cycle of serenading the bad and vilifying the good in Nigeria appears to be alive and well. MTN Nigeria’s listing has been added to a long list of what is wrong by action, while espousing what is right by words” he said  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
