 MultiChoice  This new feature forms part of the MTF initiative’s commitment to ignite Africa’s creative industries. According to the operator, the portal which was launched in March, is a pan-African, film and television digital marketplace for information on all aspects of the creative industry. The portal offers open, cost-free access to film creators across Africa to showcase their talent, access opportunities, stay up to date with industry news and expand their industry network. To date, the portal has over 15,000 registered profiles. Academy Director, MultiChoice Talent Factory Academy, West Africa, Femi Odugbemi, said: “Collaboration and knowledge-sharing is what our industry is built on and no one knows this better than MultiChoice, who collaborates with hundreds of creatives daily to feed our content platforms. Now that the world is paying even more attention to African stories, it’s important that we have our own platform that understand and support the complexities of making films and television in Africa.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
