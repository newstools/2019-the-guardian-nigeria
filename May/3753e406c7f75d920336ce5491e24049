 The building where the bodies were found  “Despite paying the sum of N1.6 million as ransom, the abductors refused to release the victims and nothing more was heard from them. The victims’ phones remained switched off. The Commissioner of Police Lagos State, CP Zubairu Muazu, detailed the commander, Special Anti Robbery Squad (SARS) to carryout an in-depth investigation into the matter with a view of rescuing the victims and apprehending the suspects. “Operatives from SARS Ipakodo base led by SP Godfrey Soriwei, arrested three suspects: Oluwatosin Olanrewaju, 40; Mayowa Olawuni, a.k.a. General; and Babatunde Idris, a.k.a. Aloma. The suspects confessed to the commission of the crime and led operatives to their den at Ikorodu where they dumped the bodies in a septic tank. Two locally-made single-barrel guns with five live cartridges, one locally-made gun with three ammunition, one locally-made revolver pistol with three live ammunition, one cutlass, one axe and some charms were recovered from them.
 
“Investigation revealed that the suspects had at various times used the abandoned company as their den, where all their targets are killed and dumped in the septic tank. As part of the investigation, four decomposed bodies were yesterday (Thursday) recovered from the septic tank for autopsy.
 
“The suspects confessed to have killed the other two rival cult members and dumped them in the septic tank before killing the two Bureau de change operators. They are currently assisting the police in the arrest of the other fleeing members of the gang. Investigation is ongoing and the suspects would be charged to court as soon as investigation is completed,” Elkana said.
