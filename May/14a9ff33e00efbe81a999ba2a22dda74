Capital market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), said it has commenced verification on behalf of Nigerians that “invested” monies in Dantata Success and Profitable Company, Kano. SEC said the verification exercise, which is part of the arrangements to commence the refund of their monies, will take place from Friday May 31st to Sunday June 2, between 9am to 4pm daily, to ascertain the level of their commitment to the company. Recall that SEC, pursuant to its powers under Section 13(w) of the Investments and Securities Act 2007, on February 6th, sealed the business premises of Dantata Success and Profitable Company (DSPC). The company was allegedly been involved in unlawful solicitation of funds from the public with a promise of inexplicable high returns to investors. The Commission therefore informed and reassured investors in DSPC that it is finalising plans for the repayment of investors’ funds (from assets so far being recovered from the company. A statement from SEC, yesterday, in Abuja, urged the “investors” to go along with the following documents: original receipt evidencing their payment or bank teller for deposit into the company’s account; valid means of identification (voters card, National Driving License, National Identity Card, international Passport etc), and investors bank account details. The action taken by the Commission is with a view to protecting investors, while warning the public to exercise utmost caution before subscribing to investment schemes by confirming the registration status of any company or individual, and the investment products they are offering before entering into any transaction with them. Information about entities registered by the Commission to provide investment services can be found on the Commission’s website: www.sec.gov.ng or at any of its offices nationwide.
