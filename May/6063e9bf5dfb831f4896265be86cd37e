Unknown gunmen in the early hours of yesterday kidnapped the Deputy Registrar (Administration) of the Taraba State University, Jalingo, Mr. Sanusi Sa’ad. The chapter chairman of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Dr. Samuel Shikaa confirmed the incident in the capital.He said the captive, who doubles as the institution’s Information and Protocol Officer, was picked from his residence within the staff quarters around 1:00a.m. Shikaa disclosed that the kidnappers gained access through the backside of the university that was yet to be fenced.A sibling of the victim, Alhaji Kalid Sa’ad, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the abductors had contacted him and demanded for ransom.He however, did not mention the amount, saying he was still negotiating with the captors. The abduction comes barely 24 hours after assailants took into custody the chairman of Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC), Mohammed Abubakar and his daughter, Yesmin while killing his driver at 3:00p.m. around Katari village along the Kaduna-Abuja highway on Monday. The duo has since been released. The police force confirmed their freedom yesterday via its Twitter handle.The statement read: “This is to bring to the knowledge of all Nigerians that Dr. Mohammed Mahmoud Abubakar, the chairman of UBEC and his daughter, Yesmin Mohammed, who were kidnapped yesterday (Monday) along Abuja-Kaduna expressway have been released. “Meanwhile, one male suspect has been arrested in connection with the crime. One AK47 rifle was also recovered. Investigation into the incident is ongoing.”Besides, the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar III, has stated that traditional rulers would not be party to abduction and the other forms of criminality plaguing the nation. He gave the assurance in his opening remarks at the Northern Traditional Council zonal peace meeting in Kaduna, which also had Governor Nasir El-Rufai, Secretary to the Government of Federation, Boss Mustapha, Inspector General of Police, Muhammad Adamu, and other prominent citizens in attendance.He described the security challenges facing the North as abnormal, as the region for long never experienced threats. He therefore sought collaborative efforts to tackle the situation. Moreover, the Minister of Defence, Musur Dan-Ali, yesterday said there were over three million small arms in the hands of non-state actors nationwide.The three million rifles in the hands of militants, according to him, translate to about 3,866 units using the United Nations benchmark of 776 personnel in a standard army battalion.He made the disclosure at same event. Also yesterday, the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Gen. Abayomi Olonisakin, charged military chiefs to “think out-of-the-box’’ and be “innovative’’ in proffering solutions to the security challenges.He gave the charge in a paper to the participants of Course 27 of the National Defence College (NDC) entitled “Military Leadership and National Security’’ in Abuja. In a similar fashion, Senate President Bukola Saraki yesterday announced at plenary that Acting IGP Adamu would appear before chamber on Tuesday, May 7 over the prevailing insecurity in the land.However, the police chief said government was poised to end the criminal activities that had led to abduction of 685 persons in parts of the north.
