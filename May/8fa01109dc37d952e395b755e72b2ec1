She will be the second seed at the French Open, which starts on Sunday, as she looks to improve on her previous best Roland Garros performance — a semi-final run in 2017. Osaka’s lead in the rankings remains in peril, although reigning French Open champion Simona Halep dropped down to third. Pliskova’s rise has seen three-time Grand Slam winner Angelique Kerber and Petra Kvitova slip two places and one spot respectively. Serena Williams returned to the top 10 after playing her first match since March in Italy, despite pulling out before her scheduled second-round match with sister Venus. WTA top 20 1.
