The opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) said President Muhammadu Buhari led administration should be held responsible for the fast-rising cases of despondency, depression, and misery in the country. “President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC administration has obstinately refused to allow any scrutiny of its books, knowing that they are catalogues of corruption, treasury looting, violations, impunity and acts that have brought our nation to its knees,” PDP spokesman Kola Ologbondiyan said in a statement on Sunday. “Most Nigerians have become downhearted in the face of an administration that wrecked our once robust economy and divided our people; in the face of worsening joblessness, piling bills, hunger, and diseases,” he added. Ologboniyan said the rising spate of suicide, slavery mission abroad, divorces, child abandonment and other social degeneration occur due to worsening economic hardship. He said the economic failure is evident in the shrinking of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to 2.1percent in the first quarter of 2019. Ologbondiyan affirmed that social vices like banditry, insurgency, marauding, bloodletting, and kidnapping with unmentionable ransoms, which  have almost become daily occurrences are a direct response to “bad governance.” He, however, noted that  what the “nation has witnessed is an official entrenchment and elevation of incompetence, deceit, propaganda, failure and cabal mentality on the corridors of power; a situation where the only achievement is the foisting of economic recession and mortgaging of the future of our nation with the accumulation of N24.39 trillion debt, with no tangible project to show.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
