The Nigerian Navy, NNS Victory Calabar, has handed over eight persons suspected to be involved in illegal conveyance of oil to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Uyo Zonal Office, including 105 drums of Premium Motor Spirit (petrol), and the wooden boat used for the illegal activity.
 
The suspects arrested onboard the boat are: Godwin Eden (Nigerian), Justice Ebanga (Nigerian), Effiong Gilbert (Nigerian), Manasseh Obani (Nigerian), Ambe Festus (Cameroonian), Alpha Emmanuel (Cameroonian), Sakwe Felix (Cameroonian) and Vasco Mekora (Cameroonian).
 
According to commander, M.D. Fefa, who handed over the suspects to the EFCC, the arrest was made on April 28, by a patrol team from his command. “My men intercepted the wooden boat laden with drums of Premium Motor Spirit, PMS, concealed under plastic drums of palm oil, at Oron Bar along the Calabar waterways, while they were transiting to Cameroon,” he said.
