Popular Nigerian singer, Naira Marley, who was arrested yesterday, May 10 by operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has opened up about his arrest. Shortly after his release from the anti-graft agency’s custody, the “Am I A Yahoo Boy” singer made a live video where he revealed that he has been arrested 24 times when he was still living in England. He said, “Lemme tell you, you don’t know me I have been arrested 24 times in England and I am not doing any other type of music, No slow songs, no love songs, just street music.” It would be recalled that the shortly after news went viral that the EFCC  had arrested the singer, the commission confirmed his arrest. According to Tony Orilade, an EFFCC spokesperson, Naira Marley whose real name is Afeez Fashola was nabbed by operators of the EFCC. Giving the reason for Naira Marley’s arrest, he said, “Yes, he is with us. He’s not the only person; he had some other persons also arrested alongside (him). They were arrested in relation to advance fee fraud — Internet-related cases and all of that. Give me a little time and I will get you the details.” Many have since connected Naira Marley’s arrest to his vocal support and defence of internet fraudsters popularly known as ‘Yahoo-Yahoo’ on social media and even going as far as to say that cybercrime is not a crime. We reported earlier that veteran entertainer, Ruggedman who is one of the critics and campaigners against yahoo yahoo said during a chat with City FM that he is happy about Naira Marley’s arrest because it would give him a reality check and also serve as a deterrent to those involved in cybercrime. However, Nigerian singer, Davido was one person who threw his weight behind Naira Marley following his arrest.
