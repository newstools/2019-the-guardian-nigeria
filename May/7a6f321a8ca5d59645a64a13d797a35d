It singled out the REC in Enugu State, Emeka Ononamadu, who was adjudged by his colleagues to have presided over the most peaceful election in the cycle and who had been so commended by INEC; and his Imo counterpart, Prof. Emeka Ezeonu. “Both men showed exemplary courage in ensuring that the elections were conducted in a manner that was free and fair in their states (of primary assignment).“Of course, these men are not the only resident electoral officers deserving of praise, but we are using them as examples of the type of service we need in the management of elections in Nigeria. We salute them and their colleagues that acted to protect the people’s mandate by ensuring that their true voice is heard,” CTA added.
