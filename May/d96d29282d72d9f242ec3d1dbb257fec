 Frenchman Felix Dorfin (L) arrives at a court in Mararam on the resort island of Lombok on May 20, 2019. – An Indonesian court on May 20 sentenced Frenchman Felix Dorfin to death for drug smuggling, in a surprise verdict after prosecutors asked for a 20-year jail term.

Indonesia has some of the world’s strictest drug laws — including death by firing squad for some drug traffickers and it has executed foreigners in the past. While prosecutors had not asked for the death penalty, Indonesian courts have been known to go beyond their demands. “After finding Felix Dorfin legally and convincingly guilty of importing narcotics… (he) is sentenced to the death penalty,” presiding judge Isnurul Syamsul Arif told the court. He cited Dorfin’s involvement in an international drug syndicate and the amount of drugs in his possession as aggravating factors. “The defendant’s actions could potentially do damage to the younger generation,” Arif added. Indonesia has not executed anyone since 2016, but a number of foreigners are still on death row including a cocaine-smuggling British grandmother and Serge Atlaoui, a Frenchman who has been on death row since 2007.
