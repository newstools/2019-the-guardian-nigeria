Veteran Yoruba Nollywood actor,  Ojo Arowosafe, better known as Fadeyi Oloro has cried out to Nigerians to help him before he dies. The ailing star who is in need of medical attention due to complications resulting from tuberculosis in a new interview has expressed that he needs helps. Opening up about his condition, he said, “I want people to stand up and help me now that I need help. I don’t want people to come to my grave when I am no more and come and be crying. It is now that they should come out and help me financially because I want to be back on my feet. I have a long way to go in this industry.” He added, “I am not okay, that is because I have exhausted all the money with me for treatment. This is not my house. It was when the whole thing started that my family brought me here to keep a low profile. I used to stay at Meiran, Lagos State. And I have been reaching out to the public, but I had to face my God. I was not like this before, I could not walk. But I am better now. Right now, I don’t have enough money for the treatment I need. I cannot work at the moment; my shoulder, hand and legs are not responding well. I cannot stand on my own, I am usually assisted whenever I want to stand or use my walk(ing) stick as support. I am just pleading with my fans and lovers to continue and stand up for support, some people have tried, but I need more financial support.” It would be recalled that it was not long ago that Nigerians came to the aid of veteran actor, Babatunde Omidina popularly known as Baba Suwe whose life was also in jeopardy because of a diabetes health condition. Recently, veteran Nollywood actress, Joke Silva opined that those who help actors should not make it public while also urging entertainers to start working towards their future.
