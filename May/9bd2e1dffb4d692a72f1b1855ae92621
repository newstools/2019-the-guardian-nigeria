Sanwo-Olu said this while delivering his inaugural speech after taking the oath of office at Tafa Balewa Square, Lagos. To avoid being ‘consumed by challenges’, Sanwo-Olu said the state must be prudent to ensure that the large population enjoys the economic prosperity and social security that the developmental agenda has to offer. “However, make no mistake, the success of our development agenda must be a shared and collective responsibility,” Sanwo-Olu said. He urged “Lagosians to rededicate ourselves to contribute our individual quotas positively and responsibility in this new drive to reform our society and take it to a higher pedestal.” “We must imbibe the spirit of being our brothers’ keeper in our daily lives at home, work, recreation and worship centres, and most especially on our roads.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
