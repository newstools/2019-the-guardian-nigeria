PHOTO: Aitor Alcalde/FIFA Nigeria’s Flying Eagles produced a dominant performance to thrash Qatar 4-0 in their first Group D match at the FIFA U-20 World Cup holding in Poland. Two goals in each of the halves ensured that Nigeria’s return to the competition after missing out of Korea 2017 ended on a good note in Tychy. The former African champions scored two goals inside 25 minutes with left-back Ikouwem Utin providing the assists on both occasions. For the first goal, Utin dumped his marker and unleashed a swerving shot, which Qatari goalkeeper Shehab Mamdouh could only push into the path of Maxwell Effiom, whose first-time volley broke the deadlock in the 12th minute of the encounter. A dozen minutes later, Utin brilliantly escaped four challenges down the left before cutting the ball back to present Okechukwa Offia with a comfortable finish from close range. In the 68th minute, Manchester City’s Tom Dele-Bashiru unleashed a sublime volley past Mamdouh after collecting a neat pass from the midfield to make it 3 – 0 for Nigeria. The fourth goal came through Aliu Salawudeen six minutes later. Flying Eagles will play their next match against the United States on Monday at the Bielsko-Bala Stadium.
