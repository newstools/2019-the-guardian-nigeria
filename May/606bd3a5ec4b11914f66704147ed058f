 Nigerian Stock Exchange  Last week, NSE’s All-Share Index and market capitalisation depreciated by 1.8 per cent to close the week at 29,212 points and N10.979 trillion respectively. Similarly, all other indices finished lower with the exception of the NSE Pension, NSE Insurance and NSE oil/gas that rose by 0.49 per cent, 1.30 per cent and 0.02 per cent respectivelyFor analysts, the trend is likely to continue ahead of this month’s inauguration of the President Muhammadu Buhari, expected to herald the new cabinet and policies that would correct certain anomalies and enhance the restoration of the much-needed confidence in the government. Specifically, analysts at Investdata believe that it is the number of ordinary Nigerians impacted by policies at this time that matter, rather than excuses for failure, intentions or needless regrets.
 
“The impact of Nigeria’s yearly budgets in recent times have not had the much expected trickle-down effect necessary to trigger economic growth and development on a large scale as expected, given that government is the biggest spender. “This has been blamed on the government’s disbursement and implementation style which hinders the flow of these resources. Construction and development of infrastructure drive the economy and create employment to oil the wheel of a progressive economy. “But unfortunately, the reverse is the case of Nigeria as the economy struggles despite the seeming improvement in economic indices. Nigerians, therefore, expect a new strategy from the economic managers from the implementation of the 2019 budget approved by the National Assembly last month, which is now awaiting assent by President Buhari,” they said. In a note from Afrinvest Securities Limited, the market, currently, is lacking drivers for a sustained bullish run, so the market would continue to trade sideways, with profit-taking and bargain-hunting activities dominating an equal amount of trading session over the short term.
