Alté scene pioneers DRB LASGIDI are back with a hot new song and music video titled, ‘Alté’.
This is the second single from their upcoming EP, ‘Pioneers’. The three-part collective consists of Teezee, Fresh L and BOJ. ‘Alté’ features a catchy up-tempo beat brought to life with visuals from the vibrant Lagos alté
scene. The new movement of cool kids freely express their individuality with fire verses from
Fresh L and cool flows Teezee. The bouncy 2Kriss beat, accompanied by BOJ’s catchy hook
quickly sets the tone for a new anthem for the new gen Naija. The ‘Alté’ music video, directed by Ademola Falomo with creative direction by DRB’s Teezee. The
video showcases the DRB boys, pioneers of the alté scene, surrounded by their eccentric friends,
expressing their creative freedom through fashion and lifestyle. A disco ball twinkling in the
lights, fairy lights and coloured hues reinforce the free-spirited and eccentric atmosphere. The
retro feel extends from the setting into the video with many parts shot with a camcorder, giving
old-school VHS tape inspired visuals. There are several cameos by artists such as Ycee,
Ajebutter22, and D-O in the video with multiple still shots of popular artists such as Wizkid,
Skepta, and Kida Kudz intersected throughout. Watch “Alté” via YouTube below;
