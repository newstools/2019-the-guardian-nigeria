PHOTO/OFFICIALEFCC/Instagram Nigeria’s anti-graft agency, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Wednesday said music star Naira Marley cannot be released because of ‘overwhelming evidence’ against him. “There is overwhelming evidence against Naira Marley; so we can’t afford to release him on administrative bail like Zlatan and the three others,” EFCC spokesman Tony Orilade said. “Naira Marley is still in our custody and will be charged to court soon and we will make the charges known in an official statement soon.” Naira Marley, real name Afeez Fashola, was arrested on Friday, May 10 due to his recent statements advocating activities of internet fraudsters, popularly called Yahoo boys. In a recent Instagram live session, Naira Marley urged Nigerians to pray for Yahoo boys saying internet fraudsters are the reason money circulates to the common man. “All you guys, all the money in your pockets, all the money you spend, you think it’s the government that is making the money go round?” Marley said. Asides Marley, EFCC also arrested another music star Zlatan Ibile with real name Temidayo Raphael in connection with internet fraud. The duo was arrested on Friday alongside Tiamiu Abdulrahman Kayode, Adewunmi Adeyanju Moses and Abubakar Musa in connection with an alleged case of internet fraud and money laundering. Zlatan was later released. But EFCC spokesman said his release does not mean he is free from the internet fraud allegation. “That Zlatan has been released does not mean they have been discharged and acquitted,” Orilade said.
