Ever since Rihanna confirmed plans for her ninth studio album earlier in 2019, the RIRI Navy has been stalking her every move. The 31-year-old Anti artist in an interview with the Times’ T Magazine, conducted by playwright Jeremy O. Harris talked about her trailblazing Fenty collaboration with LVMH, the highly anticipated forthcoming album, and much more. Rihanna says she remains hard at work on a reggae album, which remains without a release date, and admitted to be leaning toward R9 for the project’s title, since that’s all she hears from fans. “So far it’s just been R9, thanks to the Navy,” Rihanna stated. “I’m about to call it that probably, ’cause they have haunted me with this ‘R9, R9, when is R9 coming out?’ How will I accept another name after that’s been burned into my skull?” Rihanna also doesn’t see herself reuniting with Drake for this project. “Not anytime soon, I don’t see it happening. Not on this album, that’s for sure,” she declared. Items from her first Fenty/LVMH collection will debut through the Fenty online shop starting on May 29. “I want to be as disruptive as possible,” Rihanna explained of her business model. “The brand is not traditional. There is no runway show. It’s a new way of doing things because I believe that this is where fashion is going to go eventually.”
