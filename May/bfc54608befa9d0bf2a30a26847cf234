Of the 20.3 million South Africans aged between 15 and 34, 40.7 percent were not in employment, education or training, according to the data released by Statistics South Africa. South Africa’s unemployment crisis was a key battleground in the May 8 vote, which the ruling ANC party won with its lowest share of the ballot since the country embraced democracy with the fall of apartheid in 1994. “They were saying ‘president: we want jobs’… that is what we are going to do, we are going to work hard to create jobs for our people,” Ramaphosa told ANC activists on Sunday after the count gave the party 57 percent of the vote. Ramaphosa, 66, took over last year when the ANC forced Jacob Zuma to resign after nine years in office. A former trade union leader and a wealthy businessman, Ramaphosa has vowed to boost sluggish economic growth and attract foreign investment to tackle unemployment. “Within days of the election, the rise in unemployment figures is a stark reminder that without policy shifts and confidence-building initiatives, South Africa will continue to under-perform… and more ominously, will alienate its youth even further,” analyst Daniel Silk said on Twitter. Selected by lawmakers in parliament, Ramaphosa is set to be inaugurated on May 25. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
