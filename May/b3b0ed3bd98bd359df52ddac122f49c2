Ariana Grande has been adopted into the Givenchy family! On Friday, the luxury French fashion house announced that the 25-year-old popstar had been named the new face of the brand. “She naturally embodies the spirit of the Givenchy women with impertinence, generosity and a lightning wit — all cloaked in a touch of mystery” Givenchy shared in a press release. And Grande couldn’t be happier. The pop star went on to confirm the announcement on social media, sharing a variety of photos and videos of herself wearing a black Givenchy dress and a pearl-adorned hair accessory while standing with her back to the camera. Captioning all three posts with a singular black heart, the singer added the hashtags #Arivenchy and #GivenchyFamily. “I am so proud to be the new face of Givenchy. It is a House I have forever admired and to now be part of that family is such an honour,” she added. “I love this clothing and the confidence and joy it brings to the people wearing it. Not only is the clothing timeless and beautiful but I’m proud to work with a brand that makes people feel celebrated for who they are, and unapologetic about whatever they want to be.” See her posts below:    #arivenchy #GivenchyFamily @givenchyofficial A post shared by  Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) on May 10, 2019 at 6:00am PDT    #arivenchy #GivenchyFamily @givenchyofficial A post shared by  Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) on May 10, 2019 at 6:16am PDT
