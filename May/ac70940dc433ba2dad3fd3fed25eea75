Rivers United. PHOTO: Brila Enyimba’s victory run in the on-going Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) came to an end yesterday at the Yakubu Gowon Stadium, Port Harcourt where Rivers United defeated them by a lone goal. The Peoples Elephant, who occupy the second spot in Group A of the league, carved in to an Ossy Martins’ goal in the 13th minute of the fiercely contested game. Enyimba’s loss was Rangers’ gain as the Group A leaders beat Kwara United 1-0 at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium to widen the gap between them and the Aba side. Felix Ogbuke’s 10th minute goal was the decider. The victory moved Rangers to 34 points in Group A, six more than second-placed Enyimba and MFM, which forced Wikki Tourists to a 1-1 draw in Bauchi.
Wikki Tourists took the lead five minutes before the break through Franklin Anthony, while Joshua Abbah equalised for the visitors 15 minutes from time. In other games, Salib Dosso scored for Niger Tornadoes in the 79th minute to hand the Minna boys a 1-0 victory over Katsina United, just as Akwa United took their quest for a play-off spot with a 1-0 away defeat of Go Round FC in Omoku. Godspower Aniefiok scored the winning goal for the Group B leaders just before the final whistle. Plateau United defeated Gombe United 2-0 in Jos with goals from Sikiru Olatunbosun and Bernard Ovoke, while
Yobe Desert Stars held El-Kanemi Warriors to a goalless draw in Damaturu. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
