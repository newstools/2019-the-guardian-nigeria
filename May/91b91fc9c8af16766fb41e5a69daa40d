 Healthcare  The Taraba State chapter of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) stated this yesterday, at an interactive session with members of Course 41, Nigeria Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS), who were on a study visit to the state. The CSOs charged the study group to impress on the government to embark on quality health funding, as well as find ways of ensuring private sector involvement in quality health delivery. Chief Executive Officer, Women and Children Health Empowerment Foundation (WACHEF), Dr. Garba Danjuma said the CSOs have being contributing their quotas towards bridging the gaps of funding and complementing government efforts. Stressing the need to extend the insurance scheme to state levels, he urged the NIPSS study members to convince the government on the need to make vaccines available and free for the people. He said with the dwindling state of foreign funds, monies allocated to the health sector at all level should be constant. Director General, NIPSS, Jonathan M. Juma, promised to reach out to President Muhammadu Buhari and other key stakeholders in the sector to fine-tune ways to implement some of the suggestions.
