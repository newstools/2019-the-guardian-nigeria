Inspector-General of Police, Muhammed Adamu A Nigerian in diaspora, Mr. Callistus Chidozie Okafor, has petitioned the Inspector-General of Police, IGP Muhammed Adamu and President Muhammadu Buhari to order the arrest of a businessman, who allegedly swindled him of N15 million. Okafor is also pleading that the IGP prevail on the necessary police units to recover the money from his friend, one Odogwu, whom he claimed was using the connection of a powerful government official to frustrate police investigations into the matter. Okafor, who narrated his ordeals to newsmen, said his travails began in 2009 when the said Odogwu convinced him to purchase a land in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja for N15 million. He alleged that Odogwu presented him a document indicating that he purchased the land, “but when I came home in 2017, I went for verification of the land only to discover that Odogwu gave me fake documents and that he did not really buy a land for me. “So, I petitioned the Zone 2 Police Command, Onikan, Lagos, because Odogwu resides in Lagos and does his business at Trade Fair international market, Ojo area of the state. All efforts made to recover my money from Odogwu 10 years after have failed,” he said. He added that when he was finally arrested by the police, Odogwu allegedly confessed to the allegations of conspiracy, obtaining money by false pretence, stealing and forgery and pleaded with a written undertaken to refund the money to him but he never did.
