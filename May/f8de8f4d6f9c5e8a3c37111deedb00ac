Popular Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh has denied viral reports that she said in a 2012 interview that she can’t marry an Igbo man. The mother of one has taken to social media to deny the claims with a disclaimer. She wrote: “DISCLAIMER: I have heard and read a  couple of times about this topic and I am actually totally shocked at this!! I have never granted an interview saying such nonsense, I am practically Igbo. I always said it years back that I didn’t have any Facebook account and anything at that time that came from Facebook under my name was not from me. I only just joined Facebook a few years ago. Also I made a disclaimer eight years ago on Twitter about this issue. Also, as said by the invisible Tonto that I was raised by a poor father and had to sleep under bridges to make a living! Too bad. That’s far from my case, I came from money and lived an average childhood with everything I ever needed at my feet, went to the best schools in my community!! Don’t get deceived by the media, if I said it, I will boldly stand to it!! No media house can make claim to this interview so please my people these are not my words. #Enough is Enough.” This is coming on the heels of Dikeh being in a long war of allegations with her ex-husband, Olakunle Churchill. Their accusations and counter-accusations against each other have been extending for so long that the Actors Guild of Nigeria recently threatened Dikeh with a sanction if she doesn’t take her marital issues of social media.
