Buhari had in June last year, directed that from this year, Nigeria’s Democracy Day, marked every May 29 for the past 18 years, be shifted to June 12, to honour Nigeria’s Chief Moshood Abiola. Abiola won the June 12, 1993 presidential election but the results were annulled by former military ruler Gen.  Ibrahim Babangida on June 23, 1993. The minister said the decision to have a low-key inauguration for the president was taken at the meeting of the Federal Executive Council on May 8. He said, however, that invitations had been sent to world leaders to attend the ceremonies, marking the observance of Democracy Day on June 12. “Since the first observance of June 12 as Democracy Day falls into an election year and as a measure to sustain June 12 as Democracy Day, the celebration of the inauguration and the advancement of democracy in the country will now take place on June 12,’’ the minister said. According to him, the country can ill-afford two major celebrations within a two-week interval. He said that details of the events, slated for the two ceremonies would be unveiled at a world news conference, slated for May 20 in Abuja.
