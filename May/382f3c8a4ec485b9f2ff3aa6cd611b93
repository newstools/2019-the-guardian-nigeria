 Ibadan Poly  In a statement, the registrar, Mrs. Modupe Fawale, noted that a town and gown meeting held on Monday, May 6, at the North Campus Assembly Hall culminated in the decision to re-open the institution. The parents, guardians, communities surrounding the institution, traditional and religious leaders as well as landlords discussed with management the forms of indiscipline exhibited by the students. They urged the management to clip the wings of students found wanting and hand them over to law enforcement agents, if necessary. Each student, on resumption, is to pay N2,000 for fixing of damaged facilities in the institution. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
