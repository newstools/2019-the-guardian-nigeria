Domestic gas supply in Nigeria is set to increase by about 300 million standard cubic (MSCF) daily through the Asa North/Ohaji South (ANOH) Gas Processing Company, a partnership between the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), and Seplat Petroleum Nigeria Limited. With the development, Nigeria could bridge the projected shortfall in domestic gas supply, Group Managing Director, NNPC, Dr. Maikanti Baru, last week while inaugurating the company in Abuja. He said the project is an integral part of the Corporation’s Seven Critical Gas Development Project (7CGDP), adding that the move was designed to bridge the estimated 3.4 billion cubic feet of gas per day shortfall, which could arise as demand increases to about 7bcf/d by 2020. Baru urged board members of the company to sustain the momentum, and ensure timely delivery of the project below projected budget without compromising the industry best practices of zero incidences. ‘‘We believe that a private sector driven project should deliver much faster, hence we came up with a structure outside the existing Joint Venture with the intent of getting the appropriate entities to participate in the project.’’ He reiterated NNPC’s commitment to the project, adding that the dream would be kept alive to ensure smooth delivery. Chairman of the Board, Saidu Mohammed, who also doubles as NNPC Chief Operating Officer, Gas & Power, said the directors would work hard with the management to ensure attainment of projected objectives. According to him, the initiative is the first unbundled midstream company, which will run on its own from a JV operation.
