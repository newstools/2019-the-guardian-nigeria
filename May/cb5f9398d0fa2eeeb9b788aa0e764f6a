Not less than 160 applicants, including recently sacked permanent secretaries and substantive directors under grade level 16 are presently jostling for 33 vacant slots of permanent secretaries in Kano. Kano State Governor Abdullahi Ganduje hit top echelons of the state civil service with an unexpected shock when he relieved the entire permanent secretaries of their appointments. In a letter dated 9th May, Ganduje ordered immediate termination of all the permanent secretaries and call for fresh application from interested applicants including the relieved and substantive directors. The shocker was not unconnected with the involvement of some permanent secretaries in partisan politics, The Guardian gathered. The said serving permanent secretaries were allegedly found with credible evidence of membership of opposition party and played critical role to sabotage the victory of Ganduje in the last general election, a government source revealed. Beyond the allegation, Governor Ganduje during ceremonial iftar at the government house recently indicted some of the outgoing permanent secretaries accusing them of being too weak for his administration. “We realised that some of our permanent secretaries are very weak and in order to build vibrant civil service, the government will not work with weak ones. Only the right and competent people will be considered.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
