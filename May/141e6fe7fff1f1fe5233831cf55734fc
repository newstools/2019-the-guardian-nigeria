Solomon Dalung, Minister of Youth and Sport. Owing to the notice given by Sports Minister, Solomon Dalung to federations to hold their congresses to adopt and ratify their constitutions, the Muaythai Federation of Nigeria has picked July as date for its annual general meeting. Muaythai Federation of Nigeria President, Comrade Paul Egonu said yesterday that the federation’s constitution review was paramount in the agenda for the year, noting that it would chart a new course for sport’s development. Egonu disclosed that the federation was working hard to eradicate age cheating in all its competitions, saying that the federation in conjunction with schools would hold more age grade tournaments. This, he added, would help the federation to get the bio-data of Muaythai athletes to forestall any anomalies. Dalung recently at a meeting with federations’ presidents gave the bodies a time frame within which they must hold their congresses to ratify their constitutions. At the meeting, the Handball Federation of Nigeria was given up till October 31, 2019 to hold its congress, while the Hockey Federation has up till May 18, 2019 to do it. The Kickboxing Federation of Nigeria was given till July 31, 2019 to hold its congress, ratify its reviewed constitution and submit to the ministry. The Minister commended Federations that had complied with the directives, urging those yet to meet the deadline to ensure that they kept to the dates approved for their congresses.
