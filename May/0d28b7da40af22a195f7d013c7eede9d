It is preventable and curable. She explained that symptoms usually appear 10–15 days after the infective mosquito bite. The first symptoms – fever, headache, and chills may be mild and difficult to recognize as malaria. She advised early diagnosis is critical for recovery from malaria. On prevention of the disease Dr Abimbola made it clear that these parasites breeds on stagnant water and bushy surroundings, she encouraged participants to always clear stagnant water close to their habitat and keep their surroundings clean. <img class="size-full wp-image-926591 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Dr-Abimbola.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="771" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Dr-Abimbola.jpg 1080w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Dr-Abimbola-838x598.jpg 838w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Dr-Abimbola-487x348.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Dr-Abimbola-974x695.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Dr-Abimbola-320x228.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Dr-Abimbola-640x457.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Dr-Abimbola-600x428.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /> The walk featured entertaining moments as music and dance calibrated the mood of volunteers walking against Malaria, The event featured free malaria test, entertainment and refreshments.

Its Antibacterial and Anti-mosquito range is a combination of bacteria-fighting ingredients with mosquito repellent fragrances. The line was introduced to the portfolio to help reduce the rate of malaria in Nigeria by keeping mosquitoes at bay. World Malaria Day is a global event tied in recognizing efforts to end malaria hence it will serve as an opportunity to introduce the brand around that time, thereby creating awareness and communicating our solution to fighting the disease. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-926632 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_9195.jpg" alt="" width="940" height="951" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_9195.jpg 750w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_9195-591x598.jpg 591w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_9195-100x100.jpg 100w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_9195-487x493.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_9195-237x240.jpg 237w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_9195-474x480.jpg 474w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_9195-593x600.jpg 593w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" />Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Meditol-NG Instagram: @Meditolnigeria
