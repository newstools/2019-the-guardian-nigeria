Men of the Ogun State police command have arrested four suspected members of a notorious cult group for the role they played in the death of a 26-year-old man, Saibu Azeez, during a birthday party in Abule Lemode area of Ijoko in Ado/Odo local government area of the state. The arrest, according to a statement by the command’s spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, followed a distress call received by the police in Agbado Divisional Headquarters that one Oluwatoye Ogun was having a birthday party at her father’s house on Friday, May 24, when a group of boys suspected to be cultists stormed the venue of the party at about 2:00a.m. with broken bottles and unleashed terror on the people attending the party. Oyeyemi disclosed that the hoodlums stabbed the father of the celebrant on the head before they got hold of the deceased and stabbed him in his stomach. The suspects are Opeyemi Olalekan, Azeez Ologundudu, Emanuel Omoboriowo and Anigilaje Babatunde. The two injured persons were taken to the nearby hospital for treatment but Azeez died while receiving treatment. According to Oyeyemi, “preliminary investigations revealed that the deceased was likely to be a member of a rival cult group and his assailants came on a reprisal attack. The arrested suspects have all confessed been members of a cult group and body of the deceased has been deposited in the morgue for post-mortem examination.” Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, Bashir Makama, has ordered the transfer of the suspects to homicide section of the state criminal investigation and intelligence department for discreet investigation. Makama reiterates his earlier stance against cultism in the state and vowed not to rest until cultism is completely stamped out.
