 Atiku Abubakar  They reminded the panel that the judiciary remained the last hope for the growth and advancement of Nigeria’s democracy. The Special Adviser on Youths and Support Groups to the PDP presidential standard-bearer, Ambassador Aliyu Bin Abbas, made the appeal yesterday in a statement in Kaduna. According to him, the struggle to deepen the nation’s civil rule now rests on the judiciary after the contest. He urged the tribunal to exhibit neutrality in the dispensation of justice. Abbas said: “Honourable justices, as hearing of the presidential election petition is set to begin, I want to kindly remind you that, we, the Nigerian youths, have you as our last hope to restore democratic practice and principles in Nigeria and put the country back on the path of prosperity.” He recalled that in the history of nation, the judiciary, which is the bastion and the pillar of every democracy and the most sacred institution, has never been this pressurised and attacked. The aide continued: “This government has shown in some cases, flagrant disobedience to court orders thereby undermining the powers of the court, and this kind of behavior is very dangerous to our democracy. “We see you as our last hope to believe and have faith in the Nigeria of the future. In my travels outside the shores of Nigeria, I have come across several Nigerians who left the country because they have lost all hope in the leadership of the nation. “The last four years have been hellish to the Nigerian youths, as millions of them have lost their jobs.” Lamenting what he called a trying time for the country, Abbas explained that “it is only the honourable justices of the Appeal Court, set to listen to the presidential election petition, that can restore the confidence of the Nigerian youths.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
