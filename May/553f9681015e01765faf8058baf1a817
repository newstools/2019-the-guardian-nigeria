Woods, who missed the cut at last weekend’s PGA Championship, did not play a competitive round between his historic victory at Augusta National and the second major of the year at Bethpage Black and played just nine practice holes in New York due to illness. The 43-year-old was expected to play the Wells Fargo Championship before the US PGA but opted against it as the 15-time Major champion looks to manage his fitness with a limited schedule. Having celebrated his first Major in 11-years last month, Woods was not in perfect shape to contest the PGA Championship, defended by Brooks Koepka, but insisted there are no fears over his long term form and fitness.
“There’s no reason why I can’t get up to speed again and crank it back up,’’ Woods said last week. “I’ve got to start feeling a little bit better first before that happens. We’ll do that first and then start cranking it back up again. I just wasn’t moving the way I needed to. That’s the way it goes. There’s going to be days and weeks where it’s just not going to work, and today was one of those days.’’ Woods has won the Memorial, hosted by Jack Nicklaus, five times, last claiming the title in 2012.
