 Map of Katsina  The combined 16-year stint of Governors Umar Musa Yar’adua and Ibrahim Shema of the PDP ensured that potable water was piped to households in urban areas where the need was greatest but the four-year stint of the APC governor, Ibrahim Masari, tanked every good deed the PDP executed, and now plumbing works are rusting away all over town and isn’t Katsina the home state of President Muhammadu Buhari? If there were Katsina visionaries at all, they would have realised that a town on the edge of the Sahel is one that needs urgent water management culture and sustainable exploitation of groundwater reservoir-sources but this APC government covers up its gross incompetence by playing to the gallery in dishonest fashion. Now, all the efforts (time and resources) expended to put certain chieftains of the PDP down this past four years would have been committed to a national programme of potable water-works centred on the Niger-Benue confluence at Lokoja whence potable water would be piped to major urban centres in the far north; this is simple visionary planning that escaped the honcho at the top, and this is sad indeed. • Sunday Adole Jonah, wrote from Department of Physics, Federal University of Technology, Minna, Niger State To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
