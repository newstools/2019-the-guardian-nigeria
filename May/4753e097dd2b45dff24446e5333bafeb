   He said the State Government appreciates the importance of sports in wealth creation, job creation, and general economic development, and deemed it necessary to establish the LSSTF.He maintained that LSSTF subscribes to the philosophy that if the state is to achieve the goal of being a sporting hub in Africa, the funding of sports development should not be left to the government alone.
 
He said the Sports Trust Funds (STF) has been tested successfully in many nations like Australia, United Kingdom, and Ireland, and a host of others, with well-developed sports facilities and infrastructure and successful athletes’ development.  Pedro further assured that LSSTF plans to deliver 10 infrastructural projects, develop 10 athletes and couches in 10 different sports from grassroots annually, and will ensure that all projects and programmes executed are inclusive, and focused on the needs and expectations of stakeholders and Lagosians in general.He said the target funders, apart from the government, are sports-focused organisations, corporate entities, development institutions, faith-based organisations, high net-worth individuals, and the general sports-loving members of the public. In his remarks, Special Adviser on Overseas Investments to the Lagos State Governor, Ademola Abass, noted that the creation of LSSTF is to ensure that the funding of sports is taken completely out of the hands of government alone, and that the body has positioned itself as a non-governmental agency.
 
He maintained that the Fund is a bridge between the government and the private sector in the development of sports, and has engaged the services of KPMG, a foremost consultancy firm. Abass also assured of some tax incentives for foreign and local investors, who support sports development in the state, and urged the private sector to rally round the project.
