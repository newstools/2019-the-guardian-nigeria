The sector commander, however, advised motorists to cooperate with the traffic and emergency agencies working on the entire corridor to smoothen the motoring experience of all motorists. Oladele urged motorists to refrain from driving against traffic as violators risk impoundment of their vehicles and might be booked for dangerous driving which attracts the sum of N50,000 fine. He also said that traffic emergencies on the corridor could be reported on the FRSC toll free number, 122.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
