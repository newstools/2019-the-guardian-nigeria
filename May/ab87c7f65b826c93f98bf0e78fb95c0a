 [FILES] Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE)  Yesterday’s downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, among which are: Julius Berger, Zenith Bank, Caverton Offshore Support Group, UACN of Nigeria (UACN) and Nigerian Breweries.
   
Analysts at United Capital Limited said: “The major reason for the relatively lacklustre performance by the NSE can be attributed to lack of foreign interests, most likely as a result of uncertainties around the current administration as regards the team it will employ to implement its policies. There is also the current silence around who the next Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor would be, amid fears of a devaluation. Additionally, inactivity at the primary market segment has continued to make the market less attractive to FPIs.”
