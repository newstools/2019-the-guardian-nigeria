It seems either Jon Snow or Daenerys Targaryen needed a strong latte after all that dragon riding during the battle of Winterfell in the third episode of Game of Thrones. Fans on Twitter were quick to point out that the fourth episode of the series’ eighth and final season featured a scene in which the show makers seemingly left a Starbucks coffee cup in plain view. The disposable cup is only on screen for 2 seconds but is definitely visible if you’re looking for it. It is spotted during the celebratory feast following the Battle of Winterfell. Tormund Giantsbane is giving an epic toast to his friend, Jon Snow when the camera shows a glimpse of a sombre-looking Daenerys with the cup right in front of her. No, we are not making this up; we saw it too! See tweets from fans who spotted it below:
