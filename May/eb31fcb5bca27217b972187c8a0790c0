The outgoing governor of Lagos State Akinwunmi Ambode Wednesday morning has explained why he will be absent at the inauguration ceremony of the incoming governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu at Tafa Balewa Square (TBS), Lagos. Ambode, who congratulated and handed over to his successor- Sanwo-Olu on Tuesday, said the new governor deserves to enjoy his historic day without him sharing the glory with him. “The formal inauguration should have Mr. Sanwo-Olu as the star of the day. I don’t think that glory should be shared with him by my presence,” Ambode said in a statement by his media aide Habib Aruna. Ambode lost the APC governorship primaries to Sanwo-Olu, who was a former commissioner for establishment and training in the state. Trouble started for Ambode after a group loyal to the national leader of the party Asiwaju Bola Tinubu within the party called Mandate Group said they were not in support of Ambode for a second term and opted to support Sanwo-Olu. Tinubu said the Ambode performed well in office but was not a “good party man.” However, since Sanwo-Olu emerged Lagos State governor-elect after the elections, Ambode has solicited support for the incoming administration. “I have already formally handed over reins of power in the State to the new Governor in a most cordial and convivial ceremony at the State House yesterday,” Ambode said. Ambode, who noted he had quality time with Sanwo-Olu on Tuesday, said he is confident that government will succeed in the excellent tradition of progressive governance which Lagos State with support of Lagosians.
