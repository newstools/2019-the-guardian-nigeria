 President and Chairman of Council, Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria, Chief Cyril Ikemefuna Ede  “What we are doing is to refine the system and the process and to make sure that taxation is done in a civilized way and that people understand because once you know that tax is a must, the best thing for you is to learn it and do it very well,” he said.
 
While the institute’s yearly tax conference has come and gone, the tax expert said the body is now pressing the government to ensure that tax issues are appropriately stated in the nation’s fiscal plans.
 
“We have difficulties because tax laws are not reviewed for years. In fact, since the return to civil rule, only two times have the tax laws been adjusted. So, we want tax to be reviewed and tax to be included in a proper budget process so that each year, everybody will know what is on the table for tax and the government itself.
 
“Tax is law and you cannot impose any tax without passing a law on it. So the best way we suggested is to include it n the annual budget so that once you pass the budget, you pass the tax law that will reign for that year.
 
“Because tax is very dynamic, it cannot be left to last for a very long time, as taxation goes with the prevailing economic environment. So, if you are doing it on a yearly basis, you will be capturing the environment and the economic situation of the country and then you will be able to ensure that the tax is effective,” he added.
