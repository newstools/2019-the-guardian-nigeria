 Chief Executive Officer of Jumia, Nigeria, Juliet Anammah  To get these types of people, we needed to look far because we don’t have people like that in Africa. The industry is just seven years old. We don’t want the financial investors going out all the time because that can be very dangerous for the growth of the firm.  “So we need people who are long term oriented. Probably for the future IPO, we can consider the region, say Nigeria because by then people would have been better educated about the business of eCommerce.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
