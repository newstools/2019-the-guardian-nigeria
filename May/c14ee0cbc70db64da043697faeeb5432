HBO has released the first full trailer for the Drake-produced series, Euphoria, and starring Zendaya. The show, based on an Israeli series of the same name, centres around a group of teens dealing with substance abuse, sexuality, social media and more. Zendaya plays Rue, a drug addict attempting to change her life. “I promise you, if I could be a different person, I would,” she says in the trailer. “Not because I want it, but because they do.” In addition to Zendaya, Euphoria stars Maude Apatow, Sydney Sweeney, Algee Smith and Jacob Elordi. It was written by Sam Levinson. Euphoria premieres on HBO on June 16. Check out the trailer below:
