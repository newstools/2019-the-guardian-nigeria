The Dutchwoman became the first woman to win Madrid without dropping a set and climbed to a career-high ranking of fourth following the biggest title of her career. Angelique Kerber moved up one place to third, while last year’s Madrid champion Petra Kvitova slipped three spots to fifth. Switzerland’s Belinda Bencic continued her resurgence by jumping from 18th to 15th after beating Osaka on her run to the semi-finals. WTA rankings as of May 13: 1. Naomi Osaka (JPN) 6356 pts 2.
