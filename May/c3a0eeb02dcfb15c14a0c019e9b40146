Deputy National Chairman, North of the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC), Lawal Shuaibu has asked the party’s national chairman, Adams Oshiomole to resign. Shuaibu, in a six-page letter addressed to Oshiomole, said the APC chair has failed to add value to the party and should resign. “It is my honest opinion that your ability to ensure this party flourishes is deficient as you lack the necessary composure and you also don’t possess the capabilities and the requisite experience to run a political party,” the letter reads Shuaibu’s letter came after the APC lost of all Zamfara elected posts to the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP), in the just concluded general election. The APC candidate, Mukhtar Shehu won in the election, but the Supreme Court sacked the candidate as the winner for not being nominated via a valid primary election. The judge declared PDP Bello Matawalle as the governor-elect of Zamfara state and has been issued Certificate of Return.
