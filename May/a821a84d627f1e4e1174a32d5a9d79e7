A couple of months ago, Kylie Jenner and her longtime best friend Jordyn Woods stopped being friends after Khloé’s then boyfriend/baby daddy Tristan Thompson kissed her at a party. However, the awkward thing about the situation was that Jordyn was living with Kylie at the time and it wasn’t clear if she had temporarily relocated during the feud, was kicked out or had moved out entirely. And now, months later, we finally have an answer! According to TMZ, Jordyn is now fully moved out of Kylie’s place. Jordyn reportedly picked up her stuff a week and a half ago, and Kylie “was super chill about the situation.” In fact, the only reason that Jordyn had to move out her things was that someone in Kylie’s fam “recently noticed Jordyn’s stuff was still there and thought it was ridiculous and disrespectful … like she was using Kylie’s pad for storage.” After that, Kylie asked Jordyn to fully move out in order to “keep the peace” in her family. Just last night she shared an Instagram revealing that she’s moved into a new place:   finally my first piece of furniture arrived! designing homes is such a task but I’m having the best time doing it  what are some of your house hacks and favorite companies?
