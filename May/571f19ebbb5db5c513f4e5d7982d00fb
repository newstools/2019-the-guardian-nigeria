Everyone loves a dramatic cat-eye look. But we’d be lying if we said we had the patience to paint on a pair of wings everyday. And that is why you need this quick and simple makeup-artist trick to define your eyes without a lot of work. To do it, you need an eyeliner with a very small, skinny point. Look in the mirror and use your finger to gently lift your eyelid. Then you place the tip of the eyeliner below the roots of your eyelashes and dot in between the hairs. You’re essentially lining the upper water lines (taking care not to poke out my eye in the process). If you want a sultrier look, wiggle the tip a bit to distribute more ink. If this is your first time trying this trick, I suggest doing it to just one eye. Then to your other eye, take your liner and line above your upper lashes the way you typically would. You’ll see a difference right away. This makes your lashes will look thicker and darker, and your eyes will appear more pronounced, but not covered in makeup.
