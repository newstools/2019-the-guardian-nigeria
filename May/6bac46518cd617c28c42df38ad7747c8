In a preview for the BBC special A Royal Team Talk: Tackling Mental Health, which aims to help others talk about their emotions, specifically men, William, 36, opens up about his own experience with grief. “I think when you are bereaved at a very young age, anytime really, but particularly at a young age — I can resonate closely to that — you feel a pain like no other pain,” William says in the clip. “And you know that in your life it’s going to be very difficult to come across something that is going to be an even worse pain than that,” William says. “When you are bereaved at a very young age, you feel pain like no other pain.” — The Duke of Cambridge #ARoyalTeamTalk pic.twitter.com/OIIj7KSIbS — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) May 17, 2019  However, William notes that although losing a loved one can be very challenging to overcome, he found strength in sharing his story with those who experienced the same.
