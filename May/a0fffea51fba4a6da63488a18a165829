Hollywood Boulevard looked like ‘a whole new world’ on Tuesday evening when the biggest and brightest stars flocked to the Los Angeles premiere of Disney’s Aladdin. Held at the famous El Capitan Theatre, celebrities lit up the “purple magic carpet” – which Disney cleverly dubbed it- with dazzling ensembles and beautiful looks. As expected, Naomi Scott (Jasmine), Mena Massoud (Aladdin) and Will Smith (Genie) all showed up and showed out in over-the-top fits which caught everyone’s attention. For Will Smith, the special night more or less turned into a family affair as Jada Pinkett Smith, Jaden Smith, Willow Smith and Trey Smith all stepped out to show support. Dressing as loud as his Disney character Genie, the 50-year-old star donned an embroidered suit while his wife rocked a striking blue ensemble. Other notable attendees at the premiere included Nasim Pedrad (who plays Dalia in the movie) Christina Milian, Darren Criss and many more. See the entire photo highlights of the event below.
