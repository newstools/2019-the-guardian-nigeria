Nigerian Police Force Monday detained a vulture and its owner in Maiha, Adamawa State. The police authorities said it ordered the arrest of the woman and her vulture following a complaint against them by a man in Maiha. Adamu Madaki, Adamawa’s Commissioner of Police, said the man complained that the detained woman had brought a vulture and this portends an evil. “The last time someone brought three vultures into Maiha, the area was, a few days later, invaded by insurgents,” the complainant reportedly told the police. Madaki said since the community seemed to be ‘disturbed’ by the presence of the vulture, he advised the man to lodge a complaint with the Divisional Police Officer in Maiha. He said the police “were used to such types of complaints and had no option than to investigate to ascertain its credibility.”
