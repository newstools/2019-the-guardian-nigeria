Nigeria’s Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, on Tuesday, stepped in as a pacifist on his way to Ekiti State when he ran into protesters from Gbayi Village at Gossa in Abuja. The youths had barricaded the road while protesting the alleged invasion of their land by the Nigerian Military. Osinbajo got down from his car which was part of a convoy to ease the situation and to talk with the protesters. He engaged them and promised that he would meet the village heads on the best way to resolve the situation. Osinbajo was on his way to the airport to make the launch of the National Home Grown School Feeding scheme in Ekiti State. The vice presidents advised the youth to seek better and more diplomatic ways of tackling such issues. He said that the government of President Muhammadu Buhari is committed to Nigerians and that the dividend of democracy will be enjoyed by all. The protesters claimed that they had not known Osinbajo would ply that route. They said they would have acted differently had they known. The crowd that had gathered celebrated the vice president as he made his way back to his vehicle. One of the protesters hailed Osinbajo for how he handled the situation, stating that the vice president acted as humanely as possible. He further said Osinbajo empathetic to the plight of ordinary Nigerians. “Imagine that all Nigerians politicians are like Prof. (Osinbajo), this country would have succeeded since the 70s. He came down from his vehicle and he addressed us, in fact, we were happy that he accorded us so much respect. Gwatana Muktar, another protester, praised Osinbajo’s humility; he noted that they would not have granted any other politician audience. “You know during campaign he visited almost all the villages and we saw him first hand. He is a very humble man and God will continue to bless him,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
