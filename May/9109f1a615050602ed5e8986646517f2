 A completed side of the Oshodi Transport Interchange  This is following the launch of the new buses for public use under the Bus Reform Initiative (BRI) with free service on five routes, assuring that the development would redefine public transportation and make the state globally competitive. The free service was launched across five routes including Berger to Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS), Berger to Oshodi, Oshodi to TBS, Ikeja to Alausa and Ikeja to Oshodi to commemorate the Workers’ Day, after which normal service begins on May 2. Speaking at Ikeja bus terminal, one of the modern terminals constructed as part of the BRI, an official of the Lagos Bus Services Limited, operator of the buses, Mr. Timi Olajide, said it was a good thing the buses have now been finally launched for the use. He said out of the 5,000 buses planned for the initiative, the government was launching the scheme with 820 high and medium capacity buses, adding that aside the intelligent transport system component of the initiative, which will aid Lagosians to plan their journeys, comfort and safety of the people have also been factored into the process. “In each of the buses, we have six emergency exits and First Aid box, while every seat has a dedicated USB port for charging phones, free Wi-fi, television and CCTV cameras which are linked to our control centre to monitor everything going on in the buses, among other features. “We have also taken the issue of people with disabilities specially and there are seats reserved for them in the buses,” Olajide said.
