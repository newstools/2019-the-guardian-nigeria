Lagos State Governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode, in his remarks, congratulated Jakande and other award recipients, saying that AOCOED Fellowship, Diamond and Alumni awards are strictly meant for the best in the society. Ambode, represented by the Commissioner for Agriculture, Suarau Oluwatoyin, said: “I heartily congratulate Alhaji Lateef Jakande on this special honour and other distinguished personalities”. I understand that it is exceptional to be awarded a fellowship, diamond or alumni of AOCOED because of the stringent criteria for selection. This undoubtedly speaks volume about the credentials of the individuals honoured today. They are entering Hall of Fame, which is accessible to only a few and indeed the best in the society.” He stated that his administration holds the college in high esteem, having recognised that no nation can rise above the quality of its teachers.
