Greenbelt Police Department has revealed that murdered wife of Ghanaian actor, Chris Attoh, Jeniffer Bettie, was married to two different men simultaneously. Bettie was gunned down while leaving her office on Friday at about 5 p.m. at Ivy Lane, Maryland in the United States. She was reportedly shot in the head while she tried to run away from her attacker. “Waka Talent Agency is saddened by the death of Bettie Jenifer, who was married to our client, Mr. Chris Attoh. We would like to note that the family has requested to mourn in private and therefore will not be doing any press interviews or commenting on the death,” Attoh’s agency told NBC Washington. Police, however, said  Bettie’s supposed second husband, 47-year-old Kedrick Jenifer, is a convicted Baltimore drug lord who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for importing large amounts of cocaine into Baltimore from Texas. But Court records showed that Kedrick filed for divorce from Jennifer on April 9, 2018, which she reciprocated six days after. Meanwhile, Attoh married Jeniffer on October 6, 2018, after the Ghanaian actor’s marriage with Nollywood star Damilola Adegbite crashed. Before her death, there were speculations that her marriage with Attoh has hit the rock as he deleted all her pictures from his social media account. Police, however, said investigations are still ongoing as her killer is yet to be identified.
