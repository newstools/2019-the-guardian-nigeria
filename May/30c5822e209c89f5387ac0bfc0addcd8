The United Kingdom’s Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, on Thursday expressed his home government’s commitment to ensuring successes in Nigeria, during his visit. Hunt gave the reassurance to Nigerians in his response to questions sent to him from the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. “Nigeria’s success really matters to the U.K. As we leave the European Union, now is the time to redouble our efforts and commit to the partnerships we have with our African friends. “The opportunities we see right now in Africa are tremendous, with enormous potential to grow. “We must see African nations as partners and destinations for investment and trade,” he said. According to him, a free press is the first secure basis for prosperity in a world where innovation and technological advance are the central conditions for progress. The foreign secretary, who visited the North-East region of the country on Wednesday, also reaffirmed the U.K. government’s commitment to fighting Boko Haram and the Islamic State in West Africa. “The conflict here involving Boko Haram and Islamic State has displaced two million people. “U.K. support for World Food Programme has helped feed 1.5 million but we are also focusing on the long term solutions to improving livelihoods and opportunity,” he said.
