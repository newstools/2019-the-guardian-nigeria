The Serbian world number one widened his lead over Spaniard Rafael Nadal who was dumped out of the Madrid tournament by young gun Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece in the semi-finals. Tsitsipas lost the final to Djokovic but eased two places up the rankings to seventh on the strength of his recent show of form.
