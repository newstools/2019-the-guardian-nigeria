Ahead of his forthcoming “Ignorance Is Bliss” album that is set for release on Friday, May 31st, Skepta has released a video for his single “Bullet From A Gun”. The Nigerian-British singer has released two songs from the album so far having first released “Greaze Mode”. His latest video for “Bullet From A Gun” was filmed at Camden Town station on the London Underground and it sees Skepta sitting beside a baby stroller as the people of his city go about their days. It’s a low-key video but indicative of the slice of British life that Skepta is so adept at capturing. As the video plays, Skepta reminisces over a failed relationship, growing up, and the perils of fame. Watch and enjoy:
