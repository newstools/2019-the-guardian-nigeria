Corporate  Guard, a leading security and safety outfit based in Lagos, with operations in over 30 states across the country, has introduced a new security unit known as Female Security Pilot Scheme. With this new scheme, which is the deployment of females as pilot drivers, the status of females in the sector has been elevated, as they are now to play a major role like their male counterparts, who over the years are the only ones that are employed as pilot drivers by both public and private sector outfits. Speaking on this new scheme at its launch in Lagos, the head of Corporate Guard, Captain Cynthia Ojemudia, disclosed that the new scheme is in line with Corporate Guard’s matrix of adding value to the sector through constant innovation and changing the face of security in the country. Besides, she attributes the new service to the prevailing security situation in the country, which requires everyone, both male and female to be security conscious and alert in securing themselves and their environment. According to Ojemudia, the female security pilots are skilled drivers, trained and equipped with defence and security skills and tools. Adding that they operate with the added advantage of being able to “turn your car into a weapon when necessary in an emergency or threatening situation by ensuring that the passengers are safely piloted to a secured environment and out of danger and reach of their target.” The scheme offers opportunities for females wishing to pursue a career in the sector as it is open to females with school certificates and university degrees. Besides the educational qualification and other added proficiency skills, she disclosed that they are put through a two-month rigorous training in security and defensive drills, including professional and security driving by the training arm of the outfit.
