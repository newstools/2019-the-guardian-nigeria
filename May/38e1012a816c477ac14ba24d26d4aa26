The 35-year-old winger is set to leave Munich after 10 years at the end of the season and has been linked with clubs as diverse as Inter Milan and his hometown club Groningen. At a press conference in Munich on Tuesday, Robben said that he still didn’t know what life after Bayern held for him. “I am late making my decision because of my injury. I wanted to get back on the pitch first,” said Robben, who had been sidelined since November before returning to action against Hanover two weeks ago. “My wife would have preferred it otherwise, to be honest,” he said. “It is not an easy decision to make. If you decide that you are going to keep playing, you have to find a place where everything is just right, not just in terms of football but also for my family.” Asked whether he might stop playing altogether, Robben said it was possible. “It is an option, but I don’t know whether it will happen,” he said. The Dutchman won the Champions League with Bayern in 2013 and now hopes to win an eighth Bundesliga title in his last home game for Bayern this weekend. Bayern can wrap up a seventh successive league title if they beat Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday, and Robben said that he had “goosebumps” thinking about the game. “To be crowned champions on Saturday, after 10 years, in front of 70,000 fans at a full Allianz Arena. There is nothing better.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
