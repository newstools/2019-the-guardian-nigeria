He repeatedly accused MPs of deliberately postponing the ceremony, but lawmakers voted in favour of holding the inauguration on Monday with 315 backing the date and two opposing. The 41-year-old comedy actor, whose only previous experience in politics was playing the president in a TV series, crushed the incumbent Petro Poroshenko in a runoff vote held on April 21, in which he took 73.2 percent of the vote. Zelensky has promised to eradicate Ukraine’s widespread corruption and end the war with Russia-backed separatists in the east of the country, accusing the outgoing president of doing nothing to improve living standards and reduce poverty.
