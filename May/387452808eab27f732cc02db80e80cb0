Creative genius Kanye West is set to appear on the second season of David Letterman’s post-Late Show Netflix series titled “My Next Guest Needs No Introduction”. On that episode, courtesy of a new clip shared on Friday afternoon by his wife Kim Kardashian, we see West discussing the ongoing influence of his late mother and frequent songwriting inspiration he gets from her. “This would have been the funnest time of her life, to have those kids running around that house and being able to, like, go and buy them toys,” West said when asked about how her memory lives on today. “I remember my mother bought me a bear that was multicolored and I was very into Takashi Murakami at that time, on the third album Graduation. She said it kinda feels like Takashi Murakami and I was, like, ‘I don’t want that. That ain’t no Takashi Murakami bear’ and stuff like that.” A few weeks later, his mother Donda West died, prompting him to track down that bear and display it above all else. “I did everything I could to find that bear and place that bear on top of all the Takashi Murakami stuff I had in the house. But she’s here with us and she’s guiding us.” The full episode will air on Netflix later this month. Watch the clip of Kanye’s heartfelt revelation via YouTube below;
