A Migraine is a headache of varying intensity, often accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to light and sound. Migraine is one of the most common conditions in the world with over 1.5 million cases per year in Nigeria alone, according to the Migraine Research Foundation. Migraines can run in families with children and adults known to have them. Migraine headaches can cause throbbing in one particular area that can vary in intensity. Nausea and sensitivity to light and sound are also common symptoms.
Here are a few ways to get relief from a migraine; Apply Ice Pack Put an ice pack on your forehead, scalp, or neck to get pain relief. Although aren’t exactly sure why it works, but reducing the flow of blood might be part of it. You can also try a small towel or wash cloth that’s been rinsed in cold water. Acupressure Acupressure involves the application of pressure to specific parts of the body. Stimulating specific points of the body in this way is believed to release muscle tension and alleviate pain.
One popular pressure point is the LI-4 point in the space between the base of the left thumb and pointer finger and applying firm but not painful circular pressure to the LI-4 point may relieve headache pain. Stress management Stress is a common trigger for migraines. Stress can also create a cycle where migraine pain worsens the stress, which then triggers another migraine.
Finding outlets for stress, such as exercise, or meditation, may help to prevent future migraines altogether. Essential Oils Essential oils are often used as natural remedies or as an antimicrobial in homemade cleaning products. Lavender is an essential oil often recommended as a remedy for stress, anxiety, and headaches.
