A civil society organisation in Nigeria, Enough is Enough (EiE),  has filed a lawsuit at the Federal High Court Abuja against the Economic Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over its failure to investigate the bribery allegation against Kano state governor Abdullahi Ganduje. Other defendants in the suit include Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offence Commission (ICPC) and the Nigerian police. “The matter first came up for hearing on May 10th and has been adjourned to May 24th. We are committed to demanding that all who choose to serve and are elected into public office must be held accountable for their actions,” EiE assistant manager Tolulope Oladele said in a statement on Tuesday. Daily Nigerian, an online medium published four videos in October 2018 showing someone it said was Ganduje receiving wads of cash suspected to kickbacks from contractors handling state projects. Following the allegations, the Kano State House of Assembly set up a seven-man committee to probe the governor. But a high court in the state ordered the assembly to stop the investigation. Oladele, however, stated that the group has written to the ICPC, EFCC, and the Nigeria Police on December 17, 2018, to investigate the bribery allegation against Ganduje as the court of law suggested but all was to no avail. “We followed up with a reminder letter on April 2, 2019. Sadly, the executive arm of government saddled with the responsibility of investigating criminal offenses has taken no action,” he added. He noted that EiE is an organisation interested in nation building by promoting good governance, transparency, and accountability hence the demand from the antigraft commission to investigate the allegation against the governor To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
