Whether for a special occasion or for everyday use, adding these tips to one’s routine can help save money on beauty products, use less, and get the most out of every powder, cream, and potion owned. Here are six beauty tricks to improve one’s makeup skills. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-922962 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/A-model-with-a-flawless-face-beat.-Photo-Indy1000.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="1146" /> Often, people make the mistakes of curling eyelashes by merely clamping down the mascara wand and counting to three. Not only does this make an unnatural crease in one’s eyelashes, often times these curls do not last. Rather, a much suitable option that lasts longer is the pump technique, start at the base of the eyes, pump the wand three times and do the same at the eyelashes midsection. Finally, repeat these pumps at the tips. Talc powder. Photo Vogue Despite the cuteness of false lashes, they can, sometimes, be a pain to apply. Rather than having to glue on falsies, try using mascara and baby powder to make one’s lashes longer and fuller. After curling one’s eyelashes, apply one coat of mascara, dip a clean mascara wand or cotton swab into some baby powder and apply along the undersides of one’s lashes. Then apply another coat of mascara. The mascara adheres to the baby powder thus creating dark fibres which cause the lashes to look longer and fuller without falsies. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-922964 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/A-model-with-the-perfect-smokey-winged-eyeliner.-Photo-PicBon.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/A-model-with-the-perfect-smokey-winged-eyeliner.-Photo-PicBon.jpg 1080w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/A-model-with-the-perfect-smokey-winged-eyeliner.-Photo-PicBon-598x598.jpg 598w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/A-model-with-the-perfect-smokey-winged-eyeliner.-Photo-PicBon-100x100.jpg 100w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/A-model-with-the-perfect-smokey-winged-eyeliner.-Photo-PicBon-200x200.jpg 200w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/A-model-with-the-perfect-smokey-winged-eyeliner.-Photo-PicBon-487x487.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/A-model-with-the-perfect-smokey-winged-eyeliner.-Photo-PicBon-974x974.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/A-model-with-the-perfect-smokey-winged-eyeliner.-Photo-PicBon-240x240.jpg 240w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/A-model-with-the-perfect-smokey-winged-eyeliner.-Photo-PicBon-480x480.jpg 480w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/A-model-with-the-perfect-smokey-winged-eyeliner.-Photo-PicBon-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /> The eyeliner wing is a timeless makeup look that can make a girl’s eyes pop. The key to achieving this is avoiding harsh lines and achieving the perfect smudge. However, it could be a bit difficult to get the perfect wing with a thick eyeliner. Hence, try heating up the eyeliner by holding a lighter to its tip for about 2 seconds. Allow it cool for 15 seconds before applying with a brush. Facial Toner. Photo: pinterest A toner is highly ideal to tame both dry skin and oil patches. It works to sop up extra oil at night and is ideal for skin tone, texture and colour. To achieve the DIY toner, mix a half-cup of apple cider vinegar with one tablespoon of tea tree oil. Add one cup of warm water, all in a clean spray bottle. Spray the toner onto a cotton pad and swipe it over one’s face twice daily. If one’s skin is oily, simply add more apple cider vinegar. If it feels dry, on the other hand, increase the tea tree oil, then follow up with an oil-free moisturiser. However, if one has a normal or combination skin, try green tea as a toner. Brew a cup of green tea, let it cool, and then pour it into a spray bottle. It keeps for about a month and works wonders for calming redness. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-922980 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Kalab-Foundation-Brush.-Photo-Makeup-by-Kalab-1152x1152.jpg" alt="" width="1152" height="1152" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Kalab-Foundation-Brush.-Photo-Makeup-by-Kalab-1152x1152.jpg 1152w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Kalab-Foundation-Brush.-Photo-Makeup-by-Kalab-598x598.jpg 598w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Kalab-Foundation-Brush.-Photo-Makeup-by-Kalab-100x100.jpg 100w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Kalab-Foundation-Brush.-Photo-Makeup-by-Kalab-200x200.jpg 200w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Kalab-Foundation-Brush.-Photo-Makeup-by-Kalab-487x487.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Kalab-Foundation-Brush.-Photo-Makeup-by-Kalab-974x974.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Kalab-Foundation-Brush.-Photo-Makeup-by-Kalab-240x240.jpg 240w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Kalab-Foundation-Brush.-Photo-Makeup-by-Kalab-480x480.jpg 480w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Kalab-Foundation-Brush.-Photo-Makeup-by-Kalab-600x600.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Kalab-Foundation-Brush.-Photo-Makeup-by-Kalab.jpg 1252w" sizes="(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px" /> Liquid foundations could be applied with a blending foam. Yet, it might be a bit difficult to properly blend in one’s foundation using a blending foam. However, a much easier technique is to use a Foundation brush; a stipple brush, a round brush with flat bristles. Just dot the foundation over one’s face, use the brush to press it into pores, and then sweep to blend. It gives a nearly perfect airbrush finish with minimal product. Mega matte dark red lips | Pinterest Applying lipstick over chapped flaky lips is definitely not a great look. Because lips are made of thin skin, they are prone to drying out and flaking. Just as one exfoliates one’s face and body, one’s lips can use a little bit of that love as well. Use a clean, soft toothbrush to banish flakes for good. Just wet it and run it on one’s lips in a circular motion, taking care to be gentle (there’s no need to scrub). Then, make sure to moisturise well with a quality lip balm. For effective results, this should be done once a week.
