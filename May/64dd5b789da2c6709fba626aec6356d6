Nigeria Stock Exchange, Lagos The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), sustained a bearish run for the third consecutive day, occasioned by price losses in most bellwethers, resulting to a further depreciation in market capitalisation by N46 billion.

Wednesday’s performance was influenced by price depreciation in medium and large capitalised stocks, among which were, Dangote Cement, Mobil Nigeria, Guaranty Trust Bank, Nigerian Breweries, and Access Bank. Analysts at Afrinvest Limited, said: “With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of the ASI at 28.4, below the oversold region, and the strong investor sentiment, we anticipate a rebound in the near term.
