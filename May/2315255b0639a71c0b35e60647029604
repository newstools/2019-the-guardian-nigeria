The Igbo Movement, in Lagos State has urged the governor-elect, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to complete ongoing road construction at Ladipo Market and also ensure that projects left behind by the outgoing governor were completed before new ones are initiated. Leader of the movement in Lagos, Chris Onyekachi, at an interaction with newsmen at the weekend, urged the governor-elect to run an inclusive government, which he said would be of immense benefits for Lagos, with its multi-ethnic affiliation. “I appeal to him to see that everybody is carried along. We, Igbo, are business people, he should make our environment conducive since we pay our taxes. We will cooperate with Sanwo-Olu’s administration; we need a sense of belonging, last election, we went out and voted for him; God has made him our governor because it is God who crowns all,” he said. Onyekachi added that the Igbo were law-abiding and that when the incoming government felt there was anything to correct, they should approach Igbo leaders in the various markets to pass the information across, who would in turn pass it to the generality of all. Onyekachi added that the Igbo Movement was sure of the pedigree of Sanwo-Olu, which was why it campaigned for him vigorously in many markets to ensure his emergence as governor. “We campaigned in Ketu Market, Mile 12 Market, Ladipo Spare Parts Market and others to ensure his victory and the result was massive. Now that God has made him the father of Lagosians, he should carry everybody along and he should manage all. He should remember the Igbo people who campaigned for him,” he said.
