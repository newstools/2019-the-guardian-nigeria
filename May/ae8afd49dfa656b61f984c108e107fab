Other nominees were Sadio Mane, Bernardo Silva, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling. Sterling was named the Football Writers’ Association (FWA) Footballer of the Year. The PFA Fans’ Player of the Year award is determined by a public vote, which concluded on Monday. Hazard scored 16 goals and made 15 assists in the season. He is the first Chelsea player to win the award since Frank Lampard back in 2005. Hazard might be playing his last game for the Premier League club on Wednesday when they face Arsenal in Europa League final in Baku.
