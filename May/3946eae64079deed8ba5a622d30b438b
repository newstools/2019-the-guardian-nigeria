The command in a statement by its Public Relations Officer, SP Othman Abubakar on Tuesday said the ban became necessary to check the incessant use of motorcycle by criminals for kidnapping, banditry and communal clashes. It warned that the command would commence patrol to arrest anyone who violated the ban. “The Adamawa State Police Command wishes to inform the general public of the total ban of the use of motorcycles throughout the state, that is the 21 Local Government Areas of the state, till further notice. “This has become necessary because of the incessant use of such motorcycles in the commission of heinous crimes such as kidnapping, armed banditry, communal clashes and other criminal activities in the state. “By this announcement, the command will go all out on aggressive patrol and arrest of any defaulter of this directive.” It urged the public to be law abiding, support and cooperate with the police in its effort to protect lives and properties.
