But Jo has charged the present Eagles squad  to work hard  and aspire to become world-beaters.The Dutch-born tactician told The Guardian in Lagos that the 1994 Eagles were able to hold their own at the global level and also win the 1996 Olympic Gold in Atlanta because  the team were kept together and handled by a credible  coach, who was with the  Eagles for a long time. He noted that for the present Super Eagles squad to be that good, the team has to constantly play matches together with top rated sides.He expressed confidence in the Gernot Rohr led Eagles to excel at the Nations Cup, stressing that the team’s level of commitment has proved they can excel in Egypt. “The present Super Eagles need to work harder to excel at the AFCON and also be world champions. The 1994 set was successful because I was with the team for six years. I knew the strengths and weaknesses of all the players in the team. “If I needed to introduce a new player in any department, it was done tactically. I can’t say much about the present Eagles due to the fact that I am not close to the team. But my advice for the Eagles and officials is to remain together and play more games for a long while. “The present Super Eagles have what it takes to  excel in Egypt. I wish the team  the best. Nigeria has abundant talents,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
