Popular Nollywood actor, Alexx Ekubo has had it up to his neck with debtors and he is letting his frustration known by taking to Instagram to pen a message to them. The screen star who also doubles as a model threatened an unidentified debtor with witchcraft. According to him, the debtor has refused to pay up his money and when he asks, he was told to remember he is a man of God and material things are vanity. Clearly upset by the inappreciable response from his debtor, Ekubo in his post threatened to involve witchcraft to get his money back. He shared an image that reads, “When someone lends you money, it doesn’t mean they have alot. It means they thought y needed it more than them…. so learn to return people’s money with the same energy and smile u borrowed it with. ARGH!” He captioned the image, “I’ve been burnt beyond measure for the umpteenth time. One debtor had to nerve to say to me, “ah ah! Alexx ya a Man of God na, all these things are material things”  my hard earned money material thing okwaya! This one eh! I won’t even bother God, its Ogbakiri i will use & swear for you  . Share your own money experience, don’t tag the debtor o, just comment they would come & catch their sub. ” Ekubo is not the first popular face to call out a debtor on social media as it would be recalled that just recently, the owner of Escape Club, Richard Nnadi also called out his celebrity debtors and threatened to release a list of their names. His strategy to regain his money worked because he soon started thanking some of them who began to pay their debts in order not to be publicly shamed as a debtor.
