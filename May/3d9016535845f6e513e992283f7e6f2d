The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has berated the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, for resorting to hauling insults against it “to curry political relevance, ostensibly for his pecuniary interests.” The party, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said that by travelling to far away Mecca “at this Ramadan period just to meet with President Muhammadu Buhari and engage in gossips, invectives and diatribes against the PDP, Tinubu has further demonstrated that he has nothing to offer towards the development of our nation.” The party said: “It is atrocious that at the time other leaders are in the Holy Land offering prayers and supplications for our nation, Asiwaju Tinubu is in Mecca for photo-ops, playing dirty politics and hauling insults at other Nigerians just to curry relevance before President Buhari.” It alleged that Tinubu engaged “in unholy praises of a failed administration in a desperation to avert the purported threats by certain agents of the Buhari Presidency to expose him.” “This is the same Asiwaju Tinubu, who, in January 2018 at the 15th yearly Daily Trust dialogue berated the Buhari administration for its nepotism, incompetence, corrupt oil subsidy regime; blaming it for the high-level poverty in our country and counselled Nigerians to be guided by their conscience in electing leaders in the 2019 general elections,” the statement added. The PDP further claimed that “Asiwaju in criticising the Buhari administration, held rightly that “too much political and economic power resides in the hands of too few. This results in a society described by too much of unemployment, inadequate infrastructure, too little food, yet too much poverty.” It added that under President Buhari, “rather than becoming a joyous nation, Nigeria has become a cruel playground where the fears and concerns of the average person get exploited but their interests never get promoted.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
