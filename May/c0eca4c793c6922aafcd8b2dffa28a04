Herbalist arrested by EFCC Jamiu Isiaka The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arrested a 31-year-old herbalist, Jamiu Isiaka, for impersonating the group managing director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Maikanti Baru. EFCC, in a statement, said Isiaka also impersonated presidential spokesman Femi Adesina and other prominent Nigerians. The anti-graft agency said Isiaka and other suspects allegedly used the names of the senior government officials to scam a South Korean national, Keun Sig Kim, under the pretence of getting him an NNPC license that would enable him to purchase a company. The petitioner had paid over N30million into the suspect’s account as a fee to get the license. Keun Sig Kim said, “I transferred $4,285.071 to the United Bank of Africa, account number 2107575870 in the name of one Jamiu Isiaka, an associate of Mr Shola Adeshina. It is noteworthy that this account particulars have been provided severally for me to make transfer to.” Isiaka, during interrogation with EFCC officials, claimed that he used the money to perform a sacrifice on behalf of the petitioner. He claimed to have bought a vulture, elephant’s skin, elephant’s intestine, the skull of a lion, liver of gorilla and other items for the rituals. EFCC said the suspects will soon be arraigned in court while efforts are ongoing to nab other accomplices. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
