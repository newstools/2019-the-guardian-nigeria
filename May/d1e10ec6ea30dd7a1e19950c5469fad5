English singer-songwriter, Ed Sheeran has recently released a new track off his new album which seems to have a lot of hip hop influence. The latest release “Cross Me” features Chance the Rapper and PnB Rock. Sheeran took to Instagram this week to announce the release of “Cross Me”. The song serves as the second single off No.6 Collaborations Project, following the Justin Bieber-assisted track “I Don’t Care.”   My new song Cross Me featuring @chancetherapper and @pnbrock is out now everywhere. It’s taken from my No.6 Collaborations Project out on 12th July and available to pre-order now (link in bio) x A post shared by  Ed Sheeran (@teddysphotos) on May 24, 2019 at 12:00am PDT  “Cross Me” was produced by Fred Gibson.
