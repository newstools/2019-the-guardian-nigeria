Outspoken entertainer DJ Khaled dropped his latest album, Father of Asahd recently, and to celebrate he’s been sharing videos for some of the project’s notable collaborations but the most recent release has been for the track “Jealous” which features Lil Wayne, Big Sean and Chris Brown. Khaled has already released the “Higher” video featuring the late Nipsey Hussle and John Legend, “Just Us” with SZA, and “Celebrate” featuring Travis Scott and Post Malone. The video opens with DJ Khaled surrounded by bodyguards dressed in all white suits while he sits comfy in a cocaine white Maybach, before he meets with Jennifer Lopez. He eventually links up with his collaborators on the track in separate scenes. And as expected the artist is his usual eccentric self throughout the video and of course Asahd makes an appearance. Jealous was shot and directed by DJ Khaled & Eif Rivera. Watch “Jealous” via YouTube below;
