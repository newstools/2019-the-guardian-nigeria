The Police on Thursday arraigned a 36-year-old man Adesina Badmus, for assault, in an Ado-Ekiti Chief Magistrates’ Court for biting off a man’s finger during a brawl. The Police Prosecutor, Insp Johnson Okunade, told the court that Badmus, of no fixed address, committed the offence on Monday, at about 10:15 p.m., at No. 32, off Agric Road, in Ado-Ekiti. Okunade alleged that the defendant had an argument with one Ajanaku Adelegan, and assaulted him by biting off his left-hand finger. He said the offence contravened Section 338 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Ekiti State, 2012. The prosecutor, however, asked the court for an adjournment to enable him to study the case file and present his witnesses. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. His counsel, Mr Gbenga Bejide, urged the court to grant his client bail, promising that he would not jump bail. The Chief Magistrate, Mr Adesoji Adegboye, granted the defendant bail of N200, 000 with two sureties in like sum. Adegboye adjourned the case until June 17, for hearing.
