With the world now a digital sphere, the urge to create crisp content burdens many. This leads to one out of many tasks – choosing the best camera phone to achieve the aforementioned. Camera phone technology has improved in the last few years. It has finally come to the point that phones are no longer shirked by photographers but positively embraced as alternatives, especially with the advances in multi-camera capture. So if you need help making a choice? Allow our top picks listed below guide you through that decision: Huawei P30 Pro The Hauwei P30 PRO, released in April 2019, is simply the best camera phone around (so far). It’s a camera phone that has it all: superb low-light photography, unbelievable zoom capabilities (5x optical) and powerful specs like the four lenses on its rear, one of which is a ToF sensor. This means that its depth sensing is also fantastic. Even though many hoped for the price to be a little cheaper, this is still a good buy. Google Pixel 3 This is one of the best Android cameras – especially for low light. Like its predecessors, it uses just one lens on the back; its new Night Mode, which offers up stunning pictures in the low light, means that the Google Pixel 3 is simply a fantastic camera phone. Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium Released in September 2018, the Sony Xperia X722 Premium comes with some of the best video recording ever seen on a phone. It features much cleaner low light video than we’ve seen on most of the competition, while its video recording in daylight is top notch too. Perhaps the most exciting element is you can shoot slow motion video at 960 frames per second in Full HD, which is double the resolution of the Samsung Galaxy S9’s similar feature.
