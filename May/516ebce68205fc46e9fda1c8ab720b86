 Wheelchair indicating an individual of disabilities  HDI Programme Officer, Ajayi Samuel, speaking at a town hall meeting in Epe for stakeholders in the education sector, said: “We would encourage parents to allow their children to go to school because it is a violation of their rights if they are kept at home. It does not help them and the society because keeping them makes them more of a burden than an asset, but sending them to schools will transform these children with disabilities, to become assets to themselves and the society.” He nonetheless said government should do more and be sensitive to inclusive education, so that all schools can be accessible to all categories of children. “There is need for investment in building the capacity of teachers to meet inclusive education needs,” he stated.
