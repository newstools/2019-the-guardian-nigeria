The two commissioners were to appear and answer why April salary for state and local government workers was not paid till now when May salary was also due. Motion to summon them came under, “Matters of Urgent Public Importance” moved by Abdullahi Yapak (APC-Verre) and seconded by Hammanjoda Umar (APC- Jada/Mbulo).
