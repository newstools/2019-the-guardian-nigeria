 Ever busy Ladipo auto-spare parts market shutdown for business by Ladipo Central Executive Auto Dealers Association (LACEDA) to enable the traders to obtain their Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC), in Lagos… yesterday.   									      PHOTO: FEMI ADEBESIN-KUTI<br />  In a petition to the Lagos House of Assembly and Ministry of Local Government and Community Affairs, the groups noted that the Babaloja of Ladipo market, Alhaji Oladotun Abibu-Oki, was being unnecessarily harassed and intimidated by a rival association established by non-indigenes. The petition dated April 24, reads: “We appeal to the Lagos House of Assembly to come to our aid in terms of giving recognition to the Babaloja of Ladipo General Market in person of Alhaji Oladotun Abibu-Oki, who was installed by the late Alhaja Abibatu Mogaji on December 22, 2011.” The petitioners said Abibu-Oki had not been able to function well since his installation due to the negative activities of members of a rival body. They said the rival body and their thugs have violently attacked, assaulted and humiliated the Babaloja, his staff, property, warehouse and Yoruba traders in the market on several occasions.
