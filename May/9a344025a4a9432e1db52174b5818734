Impressed by the achievements, Buhari commended Amosun, saying the Governor’s performance confirmed that he prepared very well for governance. He praised the present system at the Senate, where seats are not based on population. The President’s visit was the second to the state within the last three months. He was in Abeokuta in February for his Presidential campaign. He said: “I congratulate Amosun for having the foresight and saving enough resources to ensure his footprint remains permanent, very clever person. The infrastructure he took me through, the flyovers, the bridges, the hospitals and this complex are first class. He has done very well for himself and for Ogun State.” Amosun explained that his government constructed the multi-billion Naira Judiciary Complex to replace the High Courts, which edifices where constructed four years ago. Conspicuously absent at the ceremonies, which held at different locations, were the Governor-elect, Prince Dapo Abiodun, Segun Osoba and other chieftains of the All Progressives Congress (APC). However, Governors Akinwunmi Ambode (Lagos), Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti) and Rotimi Akeredolu (Ondo) were among dignitaries that graced the occasion.
