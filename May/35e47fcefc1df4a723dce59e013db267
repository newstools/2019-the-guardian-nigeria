There are a few common reasons why men get cold feet before proposals. Once you figure out the reasons you’ll have a better handle on how to move forward. Here are the five most common proposal holdups I see in my private practice and how to tackle each one: A number of men have a vision of where they would like to be professionally before they walk down the aisle. He is unlikely to propose if his professional life isn’t where he wants it to be. Have a conversation about what he envisions for his career and what steps he feels are necessary before getting engaged, and then find out how you can best support him in achieving his goals. If he expresses this, let him know that you want to stand by his side, as his wife, while he continues to kill it at work. <img class="alignnone wp-image-919369 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/marriage_proposal-photo-credit-Boss-Bride.jpg" alt="" width="998" height="665" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/marriage_proposal-photo-credit-Boss-Bride.jpg 750w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/marriage_proposal-photo-credit-Boss-Bride-487x325.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/marriage_proposal-photo-credit-Boss-Bride-320x213.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/marriage_proposal-photo-credit-Boss-Bride-640x427.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/marriage_proposal-photo-credit-Boss-Bride-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 998px) 100vw, 998px" /> There’s the possibility that he’s undecided about whether he sees marriage in his future with you. Consider the aspect of your relationship that gives him a pause, and try to figure out whether it’s something that can change, that he can learn to accept, or that will end the relationship. Many men like to be able to support themselves and their partner before marrying. According to a survey, 47 percent of men want to be able to buy a home before getting married, and 40 percent want to be able to afford a tasteful wedding party. If money is what’s holding him back, sit down together and see where you can cut back expenses as a couple. In the meanwhile, don’t forget to focus on yourself. More often than not, In the quest for wife status, we lose our sense of self. Continue to grow emotionally, spiritually, and intellectually. And most importantly, pursue your own career goals and aspirations.
