Zendaya may have looked like a real-life Disney princess at the 2019 Met Gala, but Lindsay Lohan was definitely not impressed. The “Mean Girls” actress, 32, recently left a couple of shady comments under an Instagram photo of the 22-year-old star’s Cinderella-inspired Tommy Hilfiger ballgown, shared by a Disney fan. “Claire Danes did that with @zacposen already,” Lohan wrote, referring to the “Homeland” star’s light-up Met Gala look from 2016. In a second comment, she pushed the comparison even further: “@clairedanes you wore this dress so beautifully, I don’t know why someone thinks that they can be more chic. Ever.” <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-921904 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/lindsay-lohan-instagram-1.jpg" alt="" width="664" height="425" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/lindsay-lohan-instagram-1.jpg 664w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/lindsay-lohan-instagram-1-487x312.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/lindsay-lohan-instagram-1-320x205.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/lindsay-lohan-instagram-1-640x410.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/lindsay-lohan-instagram-1-600x384.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px" /> It wasn’t long before Zendaya’s fans jumped to her defense. “Seriously? Remind me, was #theparenttrap and #freakyfriday movies you did the original? Or did you remake something someone already did????” one fan asked. “@zendaya and @clairedanes both looked great!” “@lindsaylohan show us the dress you wore to the #metgala go ahead, I’ll wait,” another comment read, adding, “Go sit down somewhere.” Claire Danes in Zac Posen at the 2016 Met Gala (left) and Zendaya in Tommy Hilfiger at the same event in 2019 While Zendaya and Danes’ looks might appear similar at first glance, there are a number of key differences between the two. The “Romeo + Juliet” actress’ Zac Posen dress for 2016’s “Manus x Machina”-themed affair was crafted from organza woven with fiber-optic strands that allowed it to glow in the dark, and wasn’t overtly Disney-inspired. The “Spider-Man: Homecoming” star’s Tommy Hilfiger gown, on the other hand, incorporated LED strips and was clearly modeled after Cinderella’s iconic look, complete with “glass slippers,” a bejeweled pumpkin-carriage bag and even a fairy godmother (courtesy of Zendaya’s stylist Law Roach, who dressed in a coordinating cloak and illuminated his client’s look with a wave of his wand). Lohan has not attended the exclusive event since 2007.
