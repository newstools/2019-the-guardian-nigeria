Commissioner of Police in Lagos, CP Zubairu Muazu The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Muazu Zubairu, yesterday launched the Lagos edition of Operation Puff Adder. The police boss also paraded 159 suspects for armed robbery, kidnapping, cultism and other crimes in the state. Muazu, who paraded the suspects, said many dozens of ammunition were recovered from the suspects at various time. The CP further disclosed that prompt response to distress calls helped the command in foiling about 80 armed robbery attempts and 14 cases of suicide. He said: “Today marks another milestone in the history of policing in Lagos and we are here to witness a renewed vigour to tackle the security challenges confronting the state. “Of great concern are cases of cultism, traffic robbery, youth gangsterism and murder. We are therefore launching a special operation introduced by the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu Adubakar, code-named Operation Puff Adder, aimed at re-dominating and reclaiming the public space from heinous criminal elements that are bent on threatening the nation’s internal security order.” Muazu stated that the officers for the operations are drawn from Police Mobile Force (PMF), Tactical Units, Criminal Intelligence Bureau, Criminal Investigation Department, Rapid Response Squad (RSS), Taskforce and Conventional Policemen. “The men are charged to ensure zero tolerance to all forms of criminality and deal decisively with criminal elements in Lagos.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
