But Origi gave Liverpool hope with a seventh-minute goal at Anfield before Georginio Wijnaldum scored two quick second-half goals to level the tie, setting the stage for the Belgian to strike the decisive goal 11 minutes from time. Liverpool will face Ajax or Tottenham in the final in Madrid on June 1.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
