 Timi Frank  Dr. Saraki had dismissed the anti-graft body’s latest investigation of his tenure as governor of Kwara State between 2003 and 2011 as direct witch-hunt. However, the EFCC insists that the probe was launched in public interest, adding that Saraki was not above the law. Frank, in a statement in Abuja, pooh-poohed the EFCC’s claim that its never-ending investigation of Saraki was also for Saraki’s personal good. He called on the EFCC not to use its powers to settle personal scores. Meanwhile, the EFCC, Ilorin zonal office, has arrested a member of the Kwara State House of Assembly, Adebayo Mohammed, for allegedly obtaining about N4 million under false pretence. The 60-year-old lawmaker representing Ipaye/Malete/Oloru constituency, sometime in 2015, allegedly sold some plots of land that did not belong to him to a group of teachers, and issued receipts to the buyers in the name of a non-existent company. It was further alleged that he has so far resisted all attempts by his victims to recover their money. The complainants – Mary Kolade, Ezekiel Babatunde, Felicia Adebiyi, Grace Awolola, Julius Omole and Abiodun Balogun – alleged that the suspect sold plots of land to them, which was later discovered to belong to the Federal Ministry of Lands and Housing. The suspect will soon be charged to court. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
