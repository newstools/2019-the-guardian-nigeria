 Coach of Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries Football Club (MFM FC), Ilechukwu Fidelis  The match, a Match-Day 22 fixture of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) is slated for the Akure Township Stadium in Akure, Ondo State. A defeat would deny MFM a place in the Super Six, while Sunshine Stars would have their relegation to the lower division sealed. The Olukoya Boys are currently fourth on the log of Group A table with 32 points, after 22 matches while their hosts, The Owena Waves are in ninth position with 26 points. Consequently, the duel is expected to be tensioned-soaked as both sides must avoid being defeated. Speaking to The Guardian, yesterday, Fidelis expressed sadness over the situation that the club has found itself saying that the only alternative left was for it to come all out, attack and secure the important win. “It is going to be an open game for both teams with both sides having a 50/50 chance. But I know that it is going to be a very tough match. Hope is not lost yet for our qualification for the Super Six. “All I know is that we will do our best to ensure that we qualify for the play-offs. Though the fixture is very vital for both teams, but on our part we are very well prepared for it,” he said. The U-23 national team coach, who cited injuries to some key players as the major reason for its slump on the table explained, “I had issues with injuries to some of my important players during the first round, where we lost four keys players to injuries. And this period was when we played against big teams like Enyimba and Lobi Stars. “We had to resort to using players that were not tested in top flight action. It is sad that we had to go through this because if we had beaten these big teams we would have had the chance of qualifying for the playoffs,” he stated.
