The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) will today, May 31, 2019, arraign the controversial official of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Philomina Chieshe, who claimed that the missing N35 million JAMB proceeds in her custody was swallowed by a snake in Makurdi, Benue State office. Chieshe will be arraigned alongside five others before Justice Peter Afen of a Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court, Abuja. The JAMB official is being prosecuted following her refusal to furnish the board the true information on the financial status of JAMB e-cards supplied to the Benue Zonal office between 2014 and 2016.
