She said the government was still working out modalities before the implementation of the new allowance for the corps members. “Because by the Act they should earn at least the minimum wage and the NYSC also has to increase to that N30, 000,” Ahmed said. “So, because we have not done the negotiation with labour, I cannot give you the details of what we are projecting because it is simply on projections, at the end of the day, it is what we agree with labour that will be the amount that is due,” she said.

However, the finance minister said “there is also the consequential adjustment that we have to negotiate with the labour unions.” “The total implication of that would be worked out only after the negotiations and that would involve determining how much increase every other staff that is above the minimum wage would get. It could be a flat amount or a proportion. Corps members are currently earning a monthly allowance of N19,800. N18,000 minimum wage plus 1,800 as transport allowance.
