Sometime early in the year, the spokesman for Lagos State Police Command Bala Elkanah said persons wearing dreadlocks and tattoos are automatically profiled as potential criminals by the men and officers of the command. He believed tattoos and dreads were antithetical to the Nigerian culture. His comment immediately attracted an avalanche of backlash. That comment also motivated the former editor of Guardian Life and creative consultant Chidera Muoka to reach out to youths who have thriving careers who have tattoos and/or wearing dreads.

The result of her conversations with them is a five-part YouTube series tagged #MoreThanInkAndLocs. “Through this project, we are addressing society’s bias against appearances which are considered to be deviations from the “norm,” Muoka said. “Our belief is that our value and relevance are more than the symbols on our body and the style we wear our hair.” Eight persons from different industries were interviewed for the series done with Niyi Okeowo, a photographer and Kayode Idowu, a video editor.  The profiles of the persons interviewed are below. Funfere Koroye
