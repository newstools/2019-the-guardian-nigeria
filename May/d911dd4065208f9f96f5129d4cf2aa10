The Nigerian Navy said it intercepted a total of 25 smuggling boats cumulatively laden with about 26,984 bags of rice, of which about 5,500 suspects were arrested this year. The Service further revealed that 197 suspected smugglers operating in Akwa Ibom and Cross River states were also intercepted following its anti-smuggling operations. Chief of Policy and Plans, Naval Headquarters, Rear Admiral Begroy Ibe-Enwo, who made this revelation in Abuja, at a news conference on the achievements of Nigerian Navy in the past four years, further said the arrested smugglers, boats, and products were handed over to the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) for appropriate action. He attributed the success of the Navy in curbing smuggling activities to the renewed drive towards eradicating rice smuggling in support of governmentâ€™s policy on local rice production. Ibe-Enwo said the country relies on the sea for about 90 per cent of its import and export with oil being a major part of the trade.
