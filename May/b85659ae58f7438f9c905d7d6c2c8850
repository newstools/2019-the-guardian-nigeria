 [FILES] Osun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola  Isiaka Oyetola of the All Progressives Congress, who was recognised by the Independent National Electoral Commission approached the appellate court to review the tribunal judgement that sacked him as the duly elected governor of Osun in March. The tribunal, in its March 22, 2019 split judgment of two-to-one, nullified Oyetola’s victory to declare People’s Democratic Party governorship candidate Ademola Adeleke winner of the September 2018 governorship poll. Delivering the lead ruling of the three-man tribunal, Chairman Ibrahim Sirajo, said that the rerun election that held on September 27 was not necessary. The tribunal said Adeleke won the election at the first ballot on September 22, and the rerun that INEC devised to reach a final conclusion a week later was illegal. A three -member panel of the tribunal, dismissed the objections filed by Oyetola, APC and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Oyetola  moved to reverse the judgement by faulting the majority judgment on the grounds that it was perverse, replete with contradictions and not supported by evidence led by the petitioners. The Osun governor prayed the Court of Appeal to uphold his appeal, set aside the majority judgment and dismiss Adeleke’s petition at the tribunal.
