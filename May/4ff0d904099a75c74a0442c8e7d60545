 [FILES] General Church Council (GCC) of the Church of Christ In Nations (COCIN) has condemned Federal Government’s acquisition of a licence for a radio station exclusively for the Fulani.  Besides, COCIN also observed with dismay the news that government negotiated with Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) and offered it N100bn for appeasement or ranching. These were contained in a communiqué issued at the end of the 96th GCC of COCIN, held at its headquarters in Jos from May 20 to 24 and made available to The Guardian yesterday. It was signed by the COCIN President, Dr. Dachollom Datiri and General Secretary, Dr. Amos Mohzo. The communiqué also expressed concerns over increased suicide cases in the country in recent times, calling on the church and government to create awareness on the need for contentment, perseverance and hope, especially in these times of economic and social challenges. It noted that the number of election petitions already at the tribunal has reached an alarming record of 736, calling on election petition tribunals to uphold the principles of justice to all parties. According to the communiqué, attacks on communities have continued unabated, as it is not uncommon to hear ambushes and people being killed and wounded, urging government to take responsibility by taking stringent measures to curb the wanton killings.
