Lady Gaga took to Twitter on Thursday to announce that her Haus of Gaga store will officially open at the Park MGM in Las Vegas on May 30. The pop superstar tweeted out the black and white Haus of Gaga logo, with a pink neon sign that reads “Las Vegas” flashed across the centre; the launch aims to celebrate the return of her wildly popular Enigma residency. Little Monsters were quick to find a job listing posted to the MGM Resorts International career website which states the retail store is hiring part-time and full-time sales associates over 21 years of age. #HausOfGagaLV May 30th only at @parkmgm  pic.twitter.com/AOlq2iGZg2 — Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) May 23, 2019  “Become one of the stars behind the show and become part of the world’s most powerful entertainment brands,” the description reads. “Our Company has one exciting mission: To entertain the human race.” While Gaga has yet to reveal what will be sold at the store, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, there will reportedly be a range of Gaga-branded products available for purchase.
