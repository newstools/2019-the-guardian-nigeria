Though ‘Moremi The Musical’ has been modeled alongside some of Nigeria’s mega hits packing people into the theatre, the show has gone beyond a form of entertainment. It has become a key awareness to the present conversation about feminism and women leadership.
     
According to Ooni of Ife’s cultural ambassador to Queen Moremi Ajasoro (QMA), Princess Ronke Ademiluyi, women yearn for support from men, they want men to praise them but women themselves are not ready to assist one another to progress. 
   
She said that it was important for women to understand the need to express love and unity among one another. 
 
“To earn societal respect, be it in equality or in any other conversation, there is the need for them to show more love and togetherness. “This will help them to lift one another up and thus reduce their struggles.
