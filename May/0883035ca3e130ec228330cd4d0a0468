Kelly Clarkson definitely nailed her hosting gig at the Billboard Music Awards Wednesday night, and even performed her new song, “Broken & Beautiful.” Little did we know she was enduring severe appendicitis pain the whole time; she underwent surgery hours after the event to get her appendix removed. The songstress confirmed the news in a tweet on Thursday, writing, “Not gonna lie… I may or may not have broken down in tears after the show from pain.” “BUT thanks 2 all the amazing people @ Cedars-Sinai I flew home directly after the event, nailed the surgery early this morning, & feeling awesome now! Bye bye appendix #TheShowMustGoOn,” she continued. Clarkson opened the BBMAs with a medley of the year’s biggest hits, including Florida Georgia Line’s “Meant to Be,” Ella Mai’s “Boo’d Up,” Maroon 5’s “Girls Like you” and Zedd’s “The Middle.” Read her tweet below.
