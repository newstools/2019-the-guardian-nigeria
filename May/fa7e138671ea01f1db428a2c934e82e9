Other names reported in Italian media include Lazio boss Simone Inzaghi, Champions League finalist Mauricio Pochettino and France coach Didier Deschamps. “Rumours about my successors are part of the game,” said Allegri, who also won the league with AC Milan in 2011. “I am grateful to the chairman and he also said he wanted to continue with me. “I told him before Ajax that I would stay. I owe him and club.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
