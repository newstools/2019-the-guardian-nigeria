Ekiti State governor, Kayode Fayemi, has nullified all employments made by his predecessor Ayodele Fayose after July 2018 governorship election in the State. “All appointments made after the governorship election of July 2018, an exercise found to have violated due process, are hereby canceled and declared null and void,” the State’s Commissioner for Information Muyiwa Olumilua said on Wednesday during a press conference in Ado-Ekiti. “All 272 officers employed by the former Governor Fayose led administration who are still on manual payroll shall be considered for absorption into the civil service, but on a case-by-case basis and absorption will be conditional subject to availability of vacancies,” he added. Fayose towards the tail-end of his administration employed a total of 2,000 persons into the civil service. 600 teachers were recruited into the Teaching Service Commission (TSC) while 400 personnel were employed into the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) and 1,000 injected into the Ministry of Establishment. But Olumila said the ‘last minute’ employment made by the past administration lacked due process and were hurriedly done after Fayemi emerged the state’s governor. He said the nullification of employment was part of the earlier declaration by Fayemi before his swearing-in that appointments made after the governorship election would be discarded. The commissioner, however, noted that those employed during Fayemi’s first tenure, whose appointments were terminated by the Fayose administration, would also be subjected to same conditional consideration.
