The police and officials of the Environmental Health Officer of the Ejigbo Local Council Development Area (LCDA) yesterday caught a man dumping refuse on the road median in Ejigbo. As punishment for his improper act, he was made to clear all the refuse at that spot into his car and led the officers to his house to dump the waste in front of his building while he was also asked to explain his nefarious act to his neighbours. He was made to keep the refuse within his premises and asked to seek the assistance of an assigned waste operator to remove the refuse and register the premised for patronage. This is coming after a video went viral at the weekend showing officers of the Lagos Environmental Sanitation Corp (LAGSEC) and members of the public melting out punishment to a motorist who was caught dumping refuse illegally from a car at Airport road. She was forced to pick all dirt by the roadside into her car. While reacting to the video, one of the unit head of Lagos State Environmental and Sanitation Corps who pleaded for anonymity said: “We can’t do this work alone. The enforcement of the law has to be supported by well-meaning citizens. I am not saying what they did was right, but we have to keep Lagos clean. There is Private Sector Participation (PSP) everywhere, and more dumpsites are now functioning. “Sometimes it takes them 2-3 days to offload because of the queue. But now, they are back. Lagosians should know this. How much is the fee they cannot afford. I was on night duty recently and we saw some motorists come down from their cars with big new ‘Ghana Must Go’ bags loaded with refuse and then dumped by the roadside. We couldn’t nab them because they drove off immediately.” Meanwhile, some motorists who ply the Airport road, Oshodi and other suburbs in Lagos have lauded their admiration for the act, which will limit the incidences of waste dumping on the highway. A commercial driver popularly known as Ayan in Oshodi, said the punishment was well deserved and citizens will begin belting it out to anyone caught dumping waste on the road. “We even have some persons who like messing up the road with their urine.
