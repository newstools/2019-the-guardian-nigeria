The Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike Thursday accused the General Officer Commanding of the 6 Division of the Nigerian Army, Major General Jamil Sarhem, of  running an illegal oil bunkering squad. “The GOC is doing illegal bunkering, which he is using to finance his quest to emerge as the country’s Chief of Army Staff,” Simeon Nwakaudu, Wike’s special assistant on electronic media, said in a statement. “He has his own team that is making money for him through oil bunkering.” Wike said that any attempt to appoint the Sarhem as the Chief of Army Staff would spell doom for the nation’s already failing security. The Chief of Army Staff position is often occupied by the most senior commissioned officer appointed by the President of Nigeria. Wike said should he appointed as the Chief of Army Staff, Sarhem “will have a security meeting and he will release the details to criminals.” Wike also accused the GOC of compromising security in Rivers State through illegal actions. “We will have a security meeting and he will release the details to criminals, and the Chief of Army Staff will leave the man here because he is playing their role. “How will the security of the state be with such a man as the GOC? He will compromise when fighting to reduce crime. They sent us a GOC who destroyed the security architecture of the state.” Wike wondered what the Joint Task Force Operation Delta Safe would do when they encountered the illegal oil bunkering team of the GOC. He said that Rivers people stopped the GOC and his accomplices from imposing a governor on the state during the elections.
