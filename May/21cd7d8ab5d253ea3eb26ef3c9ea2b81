President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa, has withdrawn from the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja. The opposition People’s Democratic party and its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, asked Justice Bulkachuwa to recuse herself from the tribunal on the grounds that she is married to a senator-elect of the All Progressives Congress. Levi Ozuokwu, counsel to Abubakar, asked the Chairman of the tribunal to recuse herself over the likelihood of bias. After a prolonged sitting, the panel ruled against the application of the PDP for Justice Bulkachuwa’s recusal. Justice Peter Ige, a member of the panel who delivered the lead ruling on the application, said the fact that she is married to a Senator-elect of the APC is not enough to state she will be biased during the petition. Despite the ruling Justice Bulkachuwa proceeded to recuse herself for personal reasons. She said that she was glad the ruling was based on facts and the law, meaning another female judge will not go through the same ordeal.
