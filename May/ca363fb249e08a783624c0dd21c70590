Bayelsa State governor Seriake Dickson Wednesday said a ranking governor from the ruling All Progressives Congress must be elected the chairman of Nigerian Governors Forum. The governors are expected to elect a new leader to succeed Zamfara State’s Abdulaziz Yari later today. Dickson said in a statement signed by his spokesman Fidelis Soriwei People’s Democratic Party’s governors have no plans to be “disruptive’ when the election is held since it is traditional for the NGF chairman to be elected from the fold of the majority party. “The PDP Governors have no desire to be disruptive and expect that a ranking Governor from the APC, the party with the majority would be the next chairman,” Dickson said in a statement released by his spokesman Fidelis Soriwei. Both Ekiti State’s Kayode Fayemi and Kaduna State’s Nasir El-Rufai are rumoured to be eyeing the position. But Dickson insisted that since Yari is from the North, southern Nigeria should produce the next NGF chair. “I am calling on the governors who would assemble today to take a decision on the Chairmanship òf the Governor’s Forum to be guided by the time tested principle of rotation between the North and the South,” Dickson said. “Now that the Alhaji Abdulazeez Yari, Governor òf Zamfara State would be ending his tenure, we expect that the next chairman should come from the South.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
