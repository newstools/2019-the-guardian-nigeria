Mutharika of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won 38.57 percent against former evangelist Lazarus Chakwera of the Malawi Congress Party (MCP) on 35.41 percent — a gap of just 159,000 votes. High court registrar Agness Patemba told AFP the swearing-in ceremony would be conducted by Chief Justice Andrew Nyirenda at 2 pm (1200 GMT) in Blantyre’s Kamuzu sports stadium. DPP Secretary-General Grezelder Jeffrey has called on all party members to attend the swearing-in, in adverts broadcast on radio and television. Malawi won independence from colonial ruler Britain in 1964, and was then ruled by Hastings Banda as a one-party state until the first multi-party elections in 1994.
