Popular Nollywood actress, Foluke Daramola has joined the list of Nigerian celebrities to react to the case of embattled Nigerian singer, Naira Marley who was arrested by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in connection to cybercrime popularly known as yahoo yahoo. In her reaction to his arrest and arraignment, the Yoruba screen star condemned Nigerians who seem to be in support of fraud and cyber-crime. In her reaction to his ongoing trial, she shared a video shared on her Instagram page and asked people to stop justifying anyone committing fraud just to make money. She added that even though there is no money in circulation, people don’t need to turn to unsavoury methods. She shared, “Sometimes I wonder how our people think. One thing I want us to know is that two wrongs don’t make a right. Just because there is no money in the country, there is no work does not justify corruption, does not justify evil. Because our politicians are doing it does not make it right for us to do it. It is really sad when we try to paint bad as good. I don’t want to mention names and I am not going to tag anybody. We should under stand the implications, the depth of what we do.” It would be recalled that prior to his arrest, Naira Marley had urged fans to pray for internet fraudsters known as yahoo boys. According to him, they make money circulate in the economy and they are not criminals. He was later arrested alongside Zlatan Ibile, Rahman Jago and some others. Zlatan Ibile has since been released on bail while Naira Marley was arraigned in court on Monday over charges bothering on fraud and cyber-crime. He was slammed with an 11-count charge by the EFCC and was eventually remanded in Prison till May 30th when his bail application hearing will hold.
