Kit Harington is seeking professional help to deal with some ‘personal issues’. “Kit has decided to utilize this break in his schedule as an opportunity to spend some time at a wellness retreat to work on some personal issues,” Harington’s rep said in a statement shared with PEOPLE. The actor, who has portrayed Jon Snow on the acclaimed HBO series for the past 10 years, entered a “luxury rehab for stress and alcohol use” in Connecticut which costs over $120,000 per month,” Page Six reports. According to the reports, Harington has been receiving psychological coaching and behavioural therapy to help him deal with and manage stress and “negative emotions.” News of Harington checking into rehab comes a little over a week after GoTaired its controversial series finale on May 19.
