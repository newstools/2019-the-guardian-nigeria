Cardi B is addressing critics of her recent plastic surgery and defending her choice to take some time off from performing while she finishes healing. “You know, I hate canceling shows because I love money,” Cardi, 26, said in an Instagram Live video on Monday, which has since been shared on YouTube. “But like, health is wealth, so I have to do what I have to do,” she said. To the critics who said she should exercise instead of opting for surgery, Cardi said, “I do whatever the f– I want with my body.” “My job as an entertainer is a 24-hour job, bro. So, no, I don’t have time to work out,” she continued. “And I wanted specific things that I know that no matter how much I work out, is not going to get fixed. Like my boobs, no matter how much I work out, they’re not going to lift themselves. So yeah, I have to get f—- surgery. That’s right. All right?” The rapper explained that while her surface stitches have healed, there is still stitching internally that needs more time to heal. “My doctor was like, ‘Yo, you cannot be doing all these shows because you’re not fully healed.’” The rapper went on to apologize to her fans, adding that she had heard about fans in El Paso, Texas, who drove far distances to see her show, only to be disappointed that it was postponed. She said that she’s working with her team to let ticket holders know about postponements with more notice: “I told the people that book me like, let people know ahead of time that I’m going to cancel the shows.” “I gotta get better,” she said. “The way that my body be swelling up when I catch planes and s—, it’s so scary that I be freaking out. Like I really be freaking out.” Cardi announced last week that several of her scheduled concerts would be postponed.
