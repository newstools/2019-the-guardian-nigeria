The Lagos State police command yesterday debunked reports of alleged complicity in the death of an Okada rider who was said to have been chased to death by a police office. The Lagos State police command spokesman, Bala Elkana, told newsmen that there was no truth in the video, which has gone viral.
 
In a statement, he said: “The allegation is false and a complete misrepresentation of the facts. The fact is that on May 8, at about 6:05a.m. the police at Ago Okota Police Station heard a loud sound few meters away from the station and rushed out to ascertain what was going on. They found a motorcyclist, who lay down in the pool of his own blood with his motorcycle on the ground. The victim was taken to the hospital but eventually died.
 
“Inquiries from eyewitnesses around the scene, revealed that the motorcyclist was involved in a fatal accident with a vehicle along Ago Palace Way. An eyewitness known as Mr. Adedayo Benson, stated that this morning, he was standing in front of Century Hotel when he saw the Okada man, who was riding at a high speed and ran into a road bump/speed breaker. He suddenly applied his brake but was hit by a Camry car, who was driving behind.
 
“The driver of the Camry car ran before the arrival of the police. Investigation into the accident is ongoing to track and apprehend the driver of the car with a view of bringing him to justice,” he said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
