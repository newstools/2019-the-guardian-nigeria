 Osun State House of Assembly  The Chairman of the committee, Mr Debo Akanbi, gave the commendation after his committee paid an inspection visit to the site on Thursday. He said with what the lawmakers had seen on ground at the site, there was reason to believe that the project would be completed by 2020 and water would be supplied to people in Ilesa and its environs. He, however, used the opportunity of the visit to equally plead with the people of Ilesa to remain calm and patient, saying the water project would soon be completed. “I am appealing to the people of Ilesa that they should be a little patient with the state government to see to the completion of the good project,” he said. He added that the new water supply system that would be adopted after the completion of the project, would be metered so people would pay for supplies made by the water corporation. The Senior Consultant handling the project, Mrs Tawakalitu Willams, in her address assured the lawmakers that the project would be completed by December 2020. ” By the special grace of God, by the end of 2020, water must flow in Ilesa because necessary things had been put on ground for its execution. ” As at now, 16 kilometers of pipes had been laid and we have high level areas to accommodate our tanks for flowing conveniences, ” she said The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the N48.73 billion water project was flagged off in December 2017 by a former governor of Osun, Rauf Aregbesola. Aregbesola had said $65 million (N23 billion) had been sourced from the Islamic Development Bank in Saudi Arabia with a repayment period of 25 years. He said three reservoirs with capacity to produce 60 million litres of water per day would be put in place.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
