The Nigeria Police Thursday confirmed five persons missing as gunmen stormed Government Girls Secondary School Moriki, Zurmi LGA of Zamfara State. “No student was abducted as earlier reported by some media. However, two (2) caterers and three (3) of their children were later discovered missing,” the police public relations officer, Mohammed Shehu, said in a statement on Thursday. “The police are collaborating with the school authority to establish the whereabouts of the missing persons,” he added. The unknown gunmen reportedly broke into the school through the back fence with an intention to attack and abduct students. Shehu, however, stated a combined team of PMF/CTU and Civilian JTF personnel headed by the divisional police officer went to the school, confronted the armed men and prevented them from gaining access to the students’ hostels. Following the confrontations, the armed men retreated back to the bush without no student, but two caterers and three of their children were later discovered missing. Mohammed noted that “security has been beefed up in the school and its environment to forestall further happening.” “To this end, a search and rescue operation team has been dispatched to the surrounding bushes for an extensive bush combing,” Mohammed said “The Commissioner of police Zamfara state command uses this medium to call on members of the public to be very vigilant and report any suspicious character to the police for a prompt response,” he added.
