 Rapid Response Squad  A police officer who spoke on the condition of anonymity as he was not permitted to speak to the newsmen said: “When we saw the man moving suspiciously, we started monitoring his activity, but we saw him looking into the Lagoon; behaving as if he was saying his last prayers and we held him. We interrogated him and he confessed that he was tired of life.
 
“He told us he wanted to end his life because he has no job after many years that he graduated from the university. We arrested him and handed him over to the Adekunle police station. He was not acting. You know it is not easy to take one’s life. He was petrified and sweating profusely. He was shaking. You will know who is pretending. He was not. He is really frustrated, but the Adekunle police are investigating, after which we will know what to do. He may be charged for attempted suicide because it is a serious offence to take your life.” But someone else wasn’t that lucky to be prevented from committing suicide as a gospel artist with the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Michael Arowosaiye, took his own life. Arowosaiye, who regularly performed at RCCG programmes, was said to have hung himself with his belt on Tuesday afternoon at Sunnyvale Estate, Lokogoma District, Abuja, at the time the suicide of Chukwuemeka Akachi, the final year student of University of Nigeria Nsukka (UNN) was trending across the country on social media. It was gathered that the deceased, who recently ministered during a youth praise event at the church, was believed to be depressed over some personal issues, including accommodation issues. The acting spokesman, Federal Capital Territory Police Command, ASP Gajere Danjuma, confirmed the incident.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
