 Liverpoolâ€™s German manager Jurgen Klopp looks on before the UEFA Champions league semi-final second leg football match between Liverpool and Barcelona at Anfield in Liverpool, north west England on May 7, 2019. (Photo by Paul ELLIS / AFP)  The Reds trail 3-0 from the first leg and their odds of reaching a second consecutive Champions League final were further dented when Salah suffered concussion in the 3-2 win at Newcastle on Saturday. Firmino only made a cameo appearance in the first leg due to a groin injury and misses out with Origi and Shaqiri, who combined for the winning goal at Newcastle, given their chance to shine. Barcelona boss Ernesto Valverde has no such problems as he names the same side that started the first leg, having made 11 changes for the weekend defeat at Celta Vigo with the La Liga title already won. Lionel Messi captains the Catalans, while former Liverpool favourites Luis Suarez and Philippe Coutinho start on their return to Anfield.
