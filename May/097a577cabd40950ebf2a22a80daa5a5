Game of Thrones” series is sadly over. Despite its last season (season 8) receiving a mixed reaction from fans as well as the call to remake season 8, it was overall the best television series of all time with a record 19.3 million staying glued to their sets. Following the mixed reaction, a Morgan Freeman impersonator recreated the highlights of the entire Game of Thrones. “Well, that was really something, wasn’t it?” Morgan Freeman’s is heard saying. Uh-uh, we agree. Before we get carried away too, he goes on. “Look how young they were. Young and alive … and so very innocent…” he says. He says as some of the greatest moments pop up. And if you he think he’d forget to speak on all the lives that were lost, hit on the play button.
