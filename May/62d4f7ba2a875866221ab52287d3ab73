Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari Monday night admitted that the country’s security apparatus has declined, making citizens vulnerable to different attacks of insurgency groups. President Buhari, who begins his second term in office Wednesday, May 29, made the assertion in an interview aired on Nigerian Television Authority (NTA). “The security in relation to when I was in command has really gone down. I can not claim to know what happened after I left the military,” Buhari said. “They (police) were not giving the position and uniforms to impress anybody but to secure the people. In this, I feel the community leadership and police to some extent have failed this country.” The president, who expressed worry over persistent activities of kidnappers and arm bandits in some parts of the country, said police have shown its inability to arrest the criminals. He lamented that the rate of kidnapping is capable of discouraging foreign investors. “We are making noise that people should come and invest their money. But who will bring his money when his General Manager will be abducted? The government cannot build all the factories required and employ all the people and produce all the goods and services.” However, Buhari said he is ready to deal with identified lapses in the country’s security system in his second term. He stated that the police and the judiciary will be focused on for speedy delivering of justice to criminals. “I will try to make the police and the judiciary to be more efficient,” Buhari said. “There is no town where we don’t get a police station. They are supposed to be the front line of law and order.” He assured Nigerians that “the police will achieve absolute community security. To know the criminals around them and get them prosecuted.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
