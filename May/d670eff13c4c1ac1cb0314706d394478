The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has shifted the November 2, 2019 governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states by two weeks. In a statement yesterday in Abuja, the National Commissioner and Chairman, Voter Education and Information, Festus Okoye, said the decision was in response to several appeals by critical stakeholders in Bayelsa that the earlier date clashed with the state’s yearly Thanksgiving Day. According to the commission, “timelines for all other activities leading to the elections have also been adjusted to align with the new date.” Consequently, final list of candidates would be out on October 17.
