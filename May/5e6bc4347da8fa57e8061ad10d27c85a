Chief Folasade Tinubu-Ojo The Iyaloja General of Nigeria, Chief (Mrs.) Folasade Tinubu-Ojo, has described as untrue the rumoured appointment of a rival Babaloja (chief male market leader) in Ladipo auto parts market, Mushin. Her clarification followed the alarm raised by two groups, the Lagos State Auto-Parts Dealers Association (LASAPDA), Mushin zone and Concern Citizens and Stakeholders of Papa Ajao/Ladipo Community that a trader in the market was parading himself as Babaloja of the market. In the petition dated April 24, 2019, and forwarded to the Lagos State House of Assembly and Ministry of Local Government and Community Affairs, the groups noted that the Babaloja of Ladipo market, Alhaji Oladotun Abibu-Oki, who was installed by the late Alhaja Abibatu Mogaji on December 22, 2011, was being unnecessarily harassed and intimidated by a rival association established by non-indigenes. The petitioners said Alhaji Abibu-Oki had not been able to function well since his installation about eight years ago, due to the negative activities of members of a rival body led by one Monday. Speaking with newsmen on Thursday in Alausa, Ikeja, Chief Tinubu-Ojo said no rival Babaloja has been installed in the market. She noted that the person being touted as rival leader of the market was only appointed to oversee a section of the market, adding that the matter would soon receive proper attention with a view to engendering peace in the market. According to the groups, they want the state government to intervene before the situation degenerates into an ethnic crisis. “Many people have been injured on many occasions, which has led to many Yoruba Lagos State Auto Parts Dealers Association leaving the market because of the incessant attacks by the rival association, not minding the fact that we have several other tribes in the market.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
