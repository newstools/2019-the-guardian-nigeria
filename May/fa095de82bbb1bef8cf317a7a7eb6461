He left the hospital after five days and said he was “lucky” to be alive but had no immediate plans for the future. “The important thing is to be here… I don’t know what the future may bring,” he said. Casillas has 167 Spain caps, winning the 2010 World Cup and two European Championships, and also played more than 700 games for Real Madrid. He joined FC Porto in 2015 and recently extended his contract to 2020 with the option of an additional 12 months. He said Porto had told him they wanted to keep him until he turned 40.
