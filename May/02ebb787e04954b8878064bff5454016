Ayew, a son of Ghana football legend, Abedi ‘Pele’ Ayew, made his debut appearance in the Black Stars as a teenager in 2008. He captained Ghana’s junior side to win the Under-20 World Cup in 2009. The 29-year-old is replacing Black Stars all-time leading top scorer Asamoah Gyan, who recently had a row with Appiah over the captaincy position. Italy-based midfielder Kwadwo Asamoah has been named the deputy captain. A 29-man provisional squad will leave Accra for Dubai on June 1 for pre-tournament preparations, after which a final 23 will be named for the tournament, which kicks off on June 21. The Black Stars are in Group F with defending champions Cameroon, Benin and Guinea-Bissau. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
