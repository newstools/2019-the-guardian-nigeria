 Kogi State Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello.  A statement signed by the factional state Chairman Kogi APC, Hadi Ametuo, and made available to The Guardian in Lokoja, described the accusation as “faceless, incoherent and grammatically suicidal.” An online media platform, at the weekend, published a story, alleging that the Hadi Ametuo-led faction might have sold out after collecting a bribe of N50m from Bello to betray his members. But Hadi insisted there was no such meeting held at the Kogi liaison office, where he collected the said money from the governor as claimed by  those he referred to as “ghost writers.’ According to Ametuo, the write up was just “a fabrication of lies and the figment of the author’s imagination.” Meanwhile, former Senator representing Kogi Central Senatorial District, Senator Muhammed Salami Ohiare has also denied any involvement in the purported settlement between the Hadi Ametuo group and Kogi State government. A statement by his Special Assistant, Haroun Opotu Yussuf, said the ill- motivated news was just to smear the good and hard earned reputation of his principal. “It is, therefore, imperative to categorically state here that the carrier(s) or purveyor(s) of the said negative information about his involvement can best be described as a figment of their imagination and of course erroneous…” the statement  read. “Distinguished Senator Mohammed Salami Ohiare has always refrained from associating himself with anything negative or detrimental to his corporate image and by extension, Kogi State, hence not ready to compound the problems thereof…” the statement read.
