Speaking on his expectations in this season’s Premier League, Coach Yekini Adebayo of Niger United believes his boys were fully ready for the challenge at the championship. “We are the target of other teams because of our victory last year. Other teams will like to beat us, but we are ready for the challenge. It won’t be easy but we are technically and physically ready to give our best and defend our title,” he said. Also sure of success is Coach Amos Kumf Dashe of Plateau Peacocks, who said his girls have worked hard enough to earn another title this season. “We are well aware of the task ahead and we are hoping to continue from where we stopped last season and, that is, winning our games to emerge champions again. We have worked hard during the off season and we are sure the players will show all they have learnt when the league begins today.” “There will be no difference in our style, but we have added one new player to strengthen the team. We will do our best once the games start and leave everything to God. The Premier League is tough and we will approach our games with the seriousness they deserve,” Dashe stated.
