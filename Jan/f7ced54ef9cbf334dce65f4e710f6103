Enugu Rangers defeated Bantu FC 2-1 in the first leg of their last qualifying round for the Group stage of the CAF Confederation Cup in Maseru, but the Flying Antelopes are not resting on their oars. To the 2018 Aiteo Cup champions, the battle will only be won when they defeat the team from Lesotho in the return leg in Enugu on Sunday. Rangers have been preparing for the decisive leg as if the first match never happened. This, they say, is because ‘in football anything can happen.’Rangers Media Officer, Norbert Okolie told The Guardian ‘all registered and qualified players are good to go, except Akpos Adubi, who is suspended over accumulated cards. “The spirit is high and we are ready. We are not taking anything for granted though…you know this is football, but we are ready to make our fans happy.”Attacking midfielder, Chiamaka Madu, who revealed that Rangers would have recorded an even better first leg result against Bantu FC if they took their chances, said the team remained focused for Sunday’s game at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium. “We were able to curb Bantu’s play, we scored two goals and even had chances to better that result, but we will not complain with the 1-2,” Madu told a local website.“What we can achieve is very important and we hope to progress through to the group stage, but in football you never know what can happen. We will have to remain focused.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
