According to sources, the Kogi West Senator was taken away in an unmarked vehicle to an unknown location. Melaye was arrested last week by the Police after a siege on his home in Maitama, Abuja. The Senator locked away in his apartment, surrendered on the eighth day of the siege. He slumped while he was being taken into custody and was taken to the police infirmary in Garki. The People’s Democratic Party lawmaker was arrested for alleged criminal conspiracy and attempted culpable homicide. Melaye is currently standing trial in more than one suit. He has been accused of illegal possession of arms, gun running and sponsoring hoodlums in Kogi State. Police spokesman Jimoh Moshood said the shooting and injuries on a police officer by Senator Dino Melaye and his armed thugs in Kogi State on the 19th July 2018 warranted his arrest. He added that the police officer was yet to recover from the gunshot injury he sustained during the attack and was under intensive medical care. “The Police Officer, Sgt. Danjuma Saliu, is yet to recover from the gunshot injury he sustained during the attack and still under intensive medical care in the hospital.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
