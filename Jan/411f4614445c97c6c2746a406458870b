 [FILE PHOTO] Justice Mohammed Idris of the Federal High Court, Lagos, has convicted a former Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Administrative Secretary in Kwara State  “I find that the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt in the manner required by law. I, therefore, find the first and second defendants guilty as charged,” the judge said. However, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) re-arraigned Nwosu for accepting gratification from former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Mrs. Diezani Alison-Madueke. Nwosu had initially pleaded guilty to receiving N30 million bribe from Mrs. Alison-Madueke to rig the 2015 general election results, but changed his plea to not guilty. Justice Idris has adjourned sentencing until tomorrow and ordered EFCC to ensure his presence (Nwosu) in court.
