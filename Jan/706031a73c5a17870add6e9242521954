The Game has continued to make bold claims about the Kardashian-Jenner family. The Los Angeles rapper drew criticism this week over a sexually explicit track that included lines about Kim Kardashian: “I held Kim Kardashian by her throat, nigga,” he raps in the snippet. “I made her swallow my kids until she choke, nigga / I should apologize cause ‘Ye is my folks, nigga.” Read More: The Game Warned About Controversial Kim Kardashian Sex Lyrics Now the artiste has equally involved Kim’s little sister Kylie Jenner in the chaos as over the weekend DJ Akademiks posted another clip filmed during The Game’s studio session. An unreleased track is heard playing in the background, with some suggestive lyrics about the 21-year-old beauty entrepreneur. “Her sister made a billion in makeup. I used to make her Frosted Flakes when she wake up,” The Game raps. Neither Kim nor Kylie have responded to the slander. However, he defended his lyrics about Mrs West on social media Friday. “I said what I said,” he declared in an Instagram story. “I didn’t start rapping to be a nice guy. I speak my truths to my fans. If you don’t like it, don’t listen to it. F**k you.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-844043 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Game-instastory-I-603x1152.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="2445" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Game-instastory-I-603x1152.jpg 603w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Game-instastory-I-313x598.jpg 313w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Game-instastory-I-292x557.jpg 292w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Game-instastory-I-583x1114.jpg 583w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Game-instastory-I-126x240.jpg 126w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Game-instastory-I-251x480.jpg 251w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Game-instastory-I-314x600.jpg 314w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Game-instastory-I.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-844045 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Game-instastory-II-606x1152.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="2434" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Game-instastory-II-606x1152.jpg 606w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Game-instastory-II-314x598.jpg 314w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Game-instastory-II-293x557.jpg 293w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Game-instastory-II-586x1114.jpg 586w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Game-instastory-II-126x240.jpg 126w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Game-instastory-II-252x480.jpg 252w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Game-instastory-II-316x600.jpg 316w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Game-instastory-II.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> This isn’t the first time the rapper is making sexually suggestive remarks about the famous sisters as he previously claimed he had “fucked three Kardashians” in his 2016 track “Sauce.”
