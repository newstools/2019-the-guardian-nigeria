That cancer is the second leading cause of death around the world is no longer news. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that in 2018, there was 9.6 million recorded cancer deaths and 18.1 million new cases. It went further to report that one in eight men and one in 11 women will die from cancer. A group of Israeli scientists have said that the world should get ready for a major medical solution any moment from now. According to The Jerusalem Post, these scientists are laying claim to the “complete cure” to cancer which will be cheap and have minimal or no side effects. “We believe we will offer in a year’s time a complete cure for cancer,” Dan Aridor, chairman of the board of Accelerated Evolution Biotechnologies Ltd. (AEBi) in Israel said. “Our cancer cure will be effective from day one, will last a duration of a few weeks and will have no or minimal side-effects at a much lower cost than most other treatments on the market. Our solution will be both generic and personal.” AEBi is a biopharmaceutical company which concerns itself with therapeutic peptides that provide leads to difficult targets. Aridor notes that the drug is called MuTaTo (multi-target toxin) which they pride is “on the scale of a cancer antibiotic–a disruption technology of the highest order.” These peptides will be combined with a toxin that will target and kill the cancer cells. Thereafter, a DNA coding will be introduced as an antibody into a bacteriophage– “a virus that infects bacteria. The protein is then displayed on the surface of the phage. Researchers can use these protein-displaying phages to screen for interactions with other proteins, DNA sequences and small molecules.”
