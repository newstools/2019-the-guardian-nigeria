Pop star, Lady Gaga is known to always air her views especially when it concerns something that she is passionate about. The multiple award-winning songstress cum actress called out the Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence and his wife over the weekend. According to the “A Star Is Born” actress, they are terrible representations of what it means to be Christian. She made this view known when she was performing on Saturday, January 19  at the Park Theater in Vegas as part of her new residency. During her performance, the “Born This Way” crooner paused as she played the piano to talk politics and take some shots at the administration of President Donald Trump, especially the vice president and Second Lady, Karen. The entertainer first openly wondered if or when President Trump would reopen the government, which got a huge round of applause. She then launched into a tirade against the Pences over Karen resuming her teaching gig at Immanuel Christian School in VA which aims to ban LGBT kids and teachers supportive of them. She says, “And to Mike pence who thinks that it’s okay that his wife works at a school that bans LGBTQ, you’re wrong. You’re the worst representation of what it means to be a Christian.” Gaga continued, “I am a Christian woman, and what I do know about Christianity is that we bear no prejudice and everybody is welcome. So you can take all that disgrace, Mr. Pence, and look yourself in the mirror and you’ll find it right there.” Watch a clip of Gaga’s call out below: We need more people like Gaga to not be afraid and to speak up.
