But it has not yielded any dividend, as PTAD has continued to play on their intelligence, making them look stupid, he said.The pensioners expressed regrets that their hopes have been dashed with the ugly and unfortunate treatment meted in them by PTAD. According to them, 28 months after President Buhari approved their re-instatement to pension payroll in September 2016, it took 20 months for their files to be moved to Abuja, and another 10 months after the Federal Ministry of Finance had directed PTAD to verify and pay them their entitlements on April 19, 2018. “NNSL is the fore runner among other parastatals liquidated and the pensioners’ strength is currently about 800, with a total estimate of pension arrears of about N3 billion,” the pensioners said.
