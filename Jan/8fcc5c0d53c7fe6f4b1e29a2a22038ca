Chief Uche Nwosu • Directs Public Servants To Attend
All the public primary and secondary schools in the 27 councils of Imo State were yesterday allegedly closed, while the teachers, pupils and students were asked to attend the flag-off campaign of the Action Alliance (AA) governorship candidate, Chief Uche Nwosu, who is a son-in-law of Governor Rochas Okorocha. The event, which attracted a large crowd, took place at the Dan Anyiam Stadium on Wethdral Road, Owerri, the state capital. Teachers and public servants who came, clad in white and black clothes, told The Guardian that they wrote their names as attendees to escape sanction. One of the teachers, who craved anonymity, said: “We were directed to close schools and attend the rally. “We were also directed by the school head to write our names as having attended.” Nwosu, who had contested the primaries in the All Progressives Congress (APC) with others, including the party’s candidate, Senator Hope Uzodinma, was rejected by its National Working Committee (NWC) and consequently, defected to the AA with some of his supporters in the APC.
