 [FILES] Speaker Lagos State House of Assembly Mudashiru Obasa. PHOTO: TWITTER/LAHA  Commissioner for Budget and Economic Planning, Mr. Olusegun Banjo, yesterday disclosed that the state’s 2019 budget proposal, which Governor Akinwunmi Ambode forwarded to the House of Assembly on December 24, 2018 was N852.317 billion. But sources in the Assembly who preferred anonymity denied that the House had received the budget document. “How could the budget be presented after the House went on recess only for the Commissioner to say that the Assembly was verbally informed that the budget proposal would (have been) presented to the House on December 24, 2018?” he asked. This development is coming after weeks of keeping silent on the state of the 2019 appropriation bill, which fell short by 15 per cent compared to the 2018 budget of N1.046 trillion. In a statement, Banjo said Ambode had sent verbal communication to the House to present the budget on Monday, December 24, 2018 after the State Executive Council approval it on December 19, 2018, but the presentation was postponed, as the House was on recess. He explained that in order to present the budget, a letter was transmitted to the House on Friday, December 28, 2018, accompanied by copies of the budget. But the state government had failed to provide information about the budget presentation, even as government’s representatives and spokespersons were unwilling to give details on when the budget would be presented. However, the state government also failed to provide a breakdown of the budget figures, including the amounts proposed for capital and recurrent expenditures.
