Senate President and director-general of the Atiku Presidential Campaign, Dr Bukola Saraki Wednesday claimed President Muhammadu Buhari is not in charge of affairs in Nigeria. Speaking on AIT breakfast program, Kakaaki, Saraki said the President has shown lack of capacity to govern, leading to unprecedented unemployment in the country and insecurity. He maintained that the People’s Democratic Party, (PDP) Presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar will win the February 16 presidential elections. Saraki said Buhari cannot to lead the country to prosperity and noted Atiku’ background in public and the private sector gives him the advantage to lead Nigeria and attract the much needed foreign direct investment. The Senate President accused Buhari of gross incompetence that has placed  Nigeria behind Ghana as a more favoured destination for investment. He expressed confidence that PDP will go ahead of the APC in the Presidential election as more people in the north particularly the Northeast and Northwest now feel disappointed with the Buhari government. “There was no insecurity in the Northwest before this government assumed office, but now, the people are disappointed that there is no more peace. They want a change”. On their recent visit to the United States, Saraki said Atiku was invited on his merit to hold meetings in the US saying it is therefore laughable that the APC is lying to Nigerians that the former Vice President went to the US through Saraki.
