On Friday, Wall Street stocks rose for the fourth straight session, closing out a strong week on optimism over US-China trade talks. China said Monday its economy grew at its slowest pace in almost three decades in 2018, losing more steam in the last quarter. “But the impact of China’s GDP on the market was limited as the figures were within expectations,” Horiuchi told AFP. The market is watching the International Monetary Fund’s growth forecasts due later in the day, brokers said. The dollar fetched 109.55 yen in Asian afternoon trade, down from 109.72 yen in New York late Friday but still up from 109.36 yen in Tokyo on Friday. Panasonic jumped 3.30 percent to 1,093.5 yen and Toyota was up 0.27 percent at 6,817 yen after a weekend report that the electronic giant and the auto titan will set up a joint venture to manufacture batteries for electric vehicles. Nissan was up 0.43 percent at 917.5 yen amid reports the French government has told Tokyo that it wants a merger between Renault and the Japanese auto giant following the arrest of former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn. French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire on Sunday dismissed the reports of merger talks, saying “the subject is not on the table”.
