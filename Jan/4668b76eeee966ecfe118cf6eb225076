Call it what it is, Beyonce is the queen herself. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-710844 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Beyonce-on-the-cover-of-Vogue-September-2018-Issue.-Photo-Tyler-Mitchell-for-Vogue..-e1533570906508.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="722" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Beyonce-on-the-cover-of-Vogue-September-2018-Issue.-Photo-Tyler-Mitchell-for-Vogue..-e1533570906508.jpg 633w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Beyonce-on-the-cover-of-Vogue-September-2018-Issue.-Photo-Tyler-Mitchell-for-Vogue..-e1533570906508-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Beyonce-on-the-cover-of-Vogue-September-2018-Issue.-Photo-Tyler-Mitchell-for-Vogue..-e1533570906508-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Beyonce-on-the-cover-of-Vogue-September-2018-Issue.-Photo-Tyler-Mitchell-for-Vogue..-e1533570906508-281x158.jpg 281w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Beyonce-on-the-cover-of-Vogue-September-2018-Issue.-Photo-Tyler-Mitchell-for-Vogue..-e1533570906508-562x316.jpg 562w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Beyonce-on-the-cover-of-Vogue-September-2018-Issue.-Photo-Tyler-Mitchell-for-Vogue..-e1533570906508-531x299.jpg 531w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Beyonce-on-the-cover-of-Vogue-September-2018-Issue.-Photo-Tyler-Mitchell-for-Vogue..-e1533570906508-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Beyonce-on-the-cover-of-Vogue-September-2018-Issue.-Photo-Tyler-Mitchell-for-Vogue..-e1533570906508-487x275.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Beyonce-on-the-cover-of-Vogue-September-2018-Issue.-Photo-Tyler-Mitchell-for-Vogue..-e1533570906508-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Giving her successful life story as the lead of the Destiny’s Child in the 90s till date, she is one of the world’s celebrated artiste. For someone who is known all over the world, one Twitter user reaffirms that she did not relent until she achieved her status. If you examine Beyoncé between 2003-2009, she was hustling. She was hungry. She was extremely determined and she was everywhere, marketing wise. You couldn’t escape her and she had the consistency to match that determination. You just don’t see that much now. — Chris (@geminihazeleyes) January 28, 2019  However, a fan got the attention of the Beehive community after the Twitter user @itsVee opined that the mother of three should step aside that others can shine. Folk are gonna get mad at this but It’s almost about that time for Beyonce to pass the torch. — Pooch. (@ItsVee_) January 27, 2019  “Passing the touch” is not entirely a bad idea especially if there is a lot of mentees and if you have become an iconic standard. But with her performance at her tour and the Coachella which many termed Beychella (ahh, yes, the Beyonce effect), it is an entirely different matter.

That album and it’s singles were selling like hot cakes at the same time as girls like Ciara and Destiny’s Child. But y’all expect Beyoncé to slow down so your mediocre favs “can have a shot”. Stfu. — CCI  (@Coolness1994) January 28, 2019  Y’all allow 10,000 underwhelming male artists with no performance skills to repeat the same boring misogynist nursery rhymes and dominate the industry together. But when y’all talking about female artists it’s: “Beyoncé gotta pass the torch” Make it make sense. — House of Xpression (@AdrianXpression) January 28, 2019
