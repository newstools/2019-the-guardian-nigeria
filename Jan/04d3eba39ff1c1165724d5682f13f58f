A Lagos-bound Air Peace aircraft yesterday made air return in Abuja over a false alarm that it carried explosive devices. The claim, by an intending passenger, created confusion onboard and at the airport before further investigation proved the situation otherwise. Consequently, the alarmist was arrested. The pilot, it was learnt, received messages shortly after take-off that the facility might be carrying a bomb, and immediately alerted the passengers prior to return to Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. The airline’s Corporate Communications Manager, Chris Iwarah, confirmed the incident, adding that the crew acted professionally. “Passengers on board the flight were screened a second time and the aircraft thoroughly checked. At the end of the exercise, the information was found to be a hoax, as nothing was found on the it,” he clarified. He said the culprit was a passenger that could not make the flight on account of his being suspected to be mentally challenged. The plane was subsequently cleared to depart for Lagos and safely landed at the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos at about 11.44 a.m. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
