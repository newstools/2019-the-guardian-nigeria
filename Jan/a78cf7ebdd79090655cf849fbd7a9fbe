Chris Brown is undoubtedly one of the best R&B singers we have in this generation although his career is currently overshadowed by his quick temper. However, the award-winning singer who is on the way to proving himself once again is showing us that he is no longer throwing stones into the river but taking his career seriously. He is starting the New Year with an irresistible new music video release, “Undecided” and we are loving it. Although the video starts off on an arbitrary note with Brown messing with a supernatural balloon, the magic is felt when he is transported in a time-space continuum, Off his forthcoming album, “Indigo”, the magical music video is a catchy one which has the characteristic dance moves of Brown as he goes on a romantic canoodling around town with his love interest, Seraya McNeill from the hit TV series, “Empire”. It is easy to want to sing along with Brown as he sings, “I don’t wanna feel the way I do but I like it.” The video has a theme park, a massive moon, the ocean, carnival games, cotton candy, fireworks and of course we can’t ignore Brown and Seraya’s electric dance moves. Releasing the new song Chris Brown tweeted, “#UNDECIDED is available on all platforms now! Hope y’all love it. Thank you all my fans for the endless support over the years, I’m humbled and grateful to be able to keep creating for you guys. LIVE LAUGH LOVE AND BRING THE ENERGY. Video is out tomorrow!” Watch the good-vibe music video below:
