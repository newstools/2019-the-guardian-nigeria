Who remembers the lyrics of Beyonce’s Flawless  “……I woke up like this, flawless“. You too can wake up and look flawless with the tips below:  The worse thing you can do for your skin is to fall asleep with makeup on your face. In preparation of lazy days, you can keep facial wipes beside your bed. Makeup clogs the skin which can lead to skin breakouts or acne. Leaving makeup overnight on your face steals your glow the next morning. Often times after bathing, your skin may feel dry. It’s a good option to use a hydrating body cream before you fall asleep so you can wake up glowing. Exfoliating helps to get rid of dead skin and helps to make your skin pop. Ensure you exfoliate at least three times in a week.
