 [FILES] Super Eagles’ Manager, Gernot Rohr believes Nigeria has grown tremendously since its early exit at the Russia 2018 World Cup, adding, however, that there are still room for improvement.  The Eagles qualified for the 2019 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) by topping Group E during the qualifying series with a game left after missing the last two editions. The Falcons also qualified for the Women World Cup slated for France by winning the African Women Cup of Nations. Speaking to The Guardian yesterday, Lawal said with the unimpressive performance of the Super Eagles at the Russia 2018 World Cup, he would expect a better feat from the Eagles at the AFCON. “I was disappointed with the performance of the Eagles in Russia. But this year, I want them to prove their worth at the AFCON because this is one tournament that they need to stamp themselves as one of the big teams on the continent. This is necessary for them to erase what we saw in Russia. In all, we should expect better results from the team. “I expect the Super Falcons to do better than they have done at previous World Cups. But the resources available to the football federation definitely will determine the kind of support they will get. “The Nigeria Football Federation I read have lined up several friendly matches for them to attune them to the task ahead in France. So I hope the tournament this year will produce better results unlike the previous World Cup experiences aside the 1999 edition when we got to the quarterfinals,” he said. The former Eagles’ defensive midfielder, who also spoke on the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL), said he looked forward to a more structured and better-organised league.
