“Confident” crooner, Demi Lovato has called out popular social media platform, Instagram for allowing a disgusting ad fat-shaming women to end up on her feed. The award-winning “Sorry Not Sorry” hitmaker blasted the social media platform in several posts after a sponsored ad for a mobile game, “Game of Sultan” appeared on her feed and contained fat shaming content. In the ad, viewers can see a character on the left labelled as “obese” and the one on the right dubbed “pretty” but Lovato wasn’t having it and she didn’t mince words in making herself clear. It is noteworthy that Lovato has been very opened about her about her body image and food shaming herself so she feels the ad is wrong on so many levels because it can inflict pain and harm on those who struggle with eating disorders. Demi Lovato calls out Instagram | TMZ A rep for Instagram has since told TMZ the ad has been removed and adds, “We’re sorry. This ad was approved by mistake. We reviewed it again and removed it from future delivery in people’s feeds.” The company reviews millions of ads each week and sometimes mistakes are made and since the ad violates Instagram company policy, it was taken down. It would be recalled that just recently, Lovato revealed that she is grateful to be alive in a reflective post about 2018.
