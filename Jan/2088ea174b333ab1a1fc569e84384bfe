Secretary Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, the governor of Plateau state, Simon Bako Lalong, and the governor of Adamawa state, Bindo Jibrilla, all bid their farewell to late Air Vice Marshall Alex Badeh, who was buried today. The service which was held at the Pentecostal church Air Force base in Abuja, on Wednesday, was witnessed by dignitaries who came to pay their tribute to the late service chief. Alex Badeh died on the 18th of December, 2018. He was assassinated by gunmen who attacked him in his car, while returning from his farm along Abuja-Keffi Road in December 2018. The murder, which raised a lot of concern about the security situation in the country, occurred after Badeh’s Toyota Tundra truck was riddled with the killers’ bullets, leaving only him dead out of the three occupants of the vehicle. However, the Police arrested some suspects in relation to the murder. The former defence chief was laid to rest at the National Military Cemetery in the nation’s capital. In an address led by group Captain Dogo Gani titled “The lost axe head”, he praised the selfless qualities of the late Chief of Defence staff noting his dedication to service to his nation. Badeh was the 18th Chief of Air Staff in October 2012 and was appointed Chief of Defence Staff in January 2014 until his retirement in July 2015.
