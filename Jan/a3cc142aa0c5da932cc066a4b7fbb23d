 Burna Boy  The concert also witnessed ground breaking performances by some of Nigeria’s finest artistes such as Davido, Wizkid, Tuface, D’banj, Timaya, Duncan Mighty, and Patoranking with support from popular DJs: DJ Consequence and Dj Spinall. The show, which was anchored by popular hype men Shoddy and Jimmy, saw Burna Boy mesmerise the audience while letting out hit tracks from his rich collection including, Heaven’s Gate, Yawa, Like To Party and a host of many others. True to its “Shine On” tagline, Star Lager beer added some spice to the event with its Star corner. The corner was definitely a sight to behold with its signature blue design, which gave it a beautiful ambience. The beer brand pulled no stops in providing the atmosphere to match its very ambitious brand narrative. It was indeed a night of glitz, glamour and great music, combined with ice cold Star Lager Beer.Speaking on Star Lager’s sponsorship of the concert, Marketing Director, Nigerian Breweries Plc., Emmanuel Oriakhi said; “Innovation is what drives Star Lager as the brand is always at the forefront making beer drinking easier and fun in every space.” According to him, “The innovation approach is geared at breaking new grounds for consumers to enjoy Star Lager. Also, Nigerian music has over the years showcased its progressive and extremely expressive streak. This explains why we have this rich assemblage of Nigerian music stars who push boundaries and do things differently like Star Lager Beer.” The launch of the Star Music App and ‘Star The Winner Is’ are other avenues through which the beer brand has used music as a vehicle to engage with its consumers. Before now, STAR also achieved a similar effect through ‘Star Quest’ which provided the platform for the discovery of several established Nigerian musicians such as KCee who won the inaugural Star Quest in 2002 as part of the twin-act KC Presh.
