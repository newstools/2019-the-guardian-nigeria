Some people have alabaster skin that makes it seem like you have scaly skin in contrast to theirs. Achieving glowing skin is desirable but difficult. Some stars with the glowing skin on the cover of magazines have religious routines that make their skin appear smooth like butter. To get glowing skin here are a few tips to follow: Close-up of a woman drinking water from a bottle The human body is made up of 70 per cent water and it is important to maintain that volume because it has an effect not just on the well-being but on the skin. Drink a lot of water daily which helps to make the skin get rid of toxins in the body. The skin needs water to hydrate it and make it glow. <img class="size-full wp-image-828031 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sun-screen-Photo-YouTube.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sun-screen-Photo-YouTube.jpg 1280w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sun-screen-Photo-YouTube-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sun-screen-Photo-YouTube-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sun-screen-Photo-YouTube-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sun-screen-Photo-YouTube-281x158.jpg 281w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sun-screen-Photo-YouTube-562x316.jpg 562w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sun-screen-Photo-YouTube-531x299.jpg 531w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sun-screen-Photo-YouTube-487x274.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sun-screen-Photo-YouTube-974x548.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sun-screen-Photo-YouTube-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Some people are of the opinion that certain skin types do not need protection from the ultraviolet rays of the sun. But UV rays affect all skin types, so to ensure your skin does not turn to animal hide, use sunscreen or products that have SPF in them. It is important to know your skin type and what allergies you have to a certain product. It is tempting to use a product that everybody swears by but remember all skin types are not the same. Do a skin test and discover what best suits your skin or that product being sold as the best thing will turn your skin to the scales of a hideous reptile. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-828036 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Man-Exfoliating-Photo-Healthline.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="750" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Man-Exfoliating-Photo-Healthline.jpg 732w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Man-Exfoliating-Photo-Healthline-320x240.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Man-Exfoliating-Photo-Healthline-640x480.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Man-Exfoliating-Photo-Healthline-487x365.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Man-Exfoliating-Photo-Healthline-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /> Exfoliate your skin at least once a week. It’s difficult if you have a busy schedule but take out a day and get this done. This helps to get rid of the dead skin cells and rejuvenates the skin. You can opt for natural exfoliating products like honey, milk, bananas, avocados etc. but ensure you do a test first to be sure what best suits your skin. Stress doesn’t just affect your mental and emotional health, it also affects the skin. Find out your stressors and avoid them because stress wrinkles the skin and even causes pimples and can even hasten ageing. Use cleansers to cleanse the skin of dirt, extra oil and makeup. This should be done daily and then use moisturiser to keep the skin from being dry and flaky. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-828033 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Fruits-and-vegetables-Photo-Berkeley-Wellness.jpg" alt="" width="988" height="380" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Fruits-and-vegetables-Photo-Berkeley-Wellness.jpg 988w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Fruits-and-vegetables-Photo-Berkeley-Wellness-487x187.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Fruits-and-vegetables-Photo-Berkeley-Wellness-974x375.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Fruits-and-vegetables-Photo-Berkeley-Wellness-320x123.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Fruits-and-vegetables-Photo-Berkeley-Wellness-640x246.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Fruits-and-vegetables-Photo-Berkeley-Wellness-600x231.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 988px) 100vw, 988px" /> Take food rich with antioxidants, vitamins and selenium. This helps to enrich the skin and make it glow. Avoid sugary and junk food as they may cause breakouts. Touching the face and attempting to pick blemish on the face is not a good idea. The hands often come in contact with dirt and germs which may be transferred to the skin especially the face.
