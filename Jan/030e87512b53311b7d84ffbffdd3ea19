The governor, going round the 12 wards in the LGA, accompanied by APC chieftains and candidates, said voting for the partyâ€™s candidates to fill positions at the national and state assemblies would allow for better representation. Obaseki said that his administration had focused on governance for the past two years to make issue-based campaigns easy. He said that if the APC had representation at the National Assembly, there would be better collaborations and more dividends of democracy. The governor said that for the purpose of effective grassroots campaign, wards with over 20 units would be split into two or three. He split Oredo Ward 2 with 36 units into three wards, Oredo ward 5 with 30 units into 2, and Oredo Ward 4 with 28 units into 2. He assured the ward members that after the election he would discuss with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to formally recognise the new ones. The governor also pledged to continue road projects in the LGA as well as build a primary school and an ultra-modern health centre at Ward 6, a ward which had no primary school. Addressing journalist on his electioneering promises, APC Edo South Senatorial candidate, Mr Patrick Obahiagbon, said he would ensure community-based governance. Similarly, the APC candidate for Oredo constituency at the State House of Assembly, Mr Osaro Obazee, pledged to focus on sponsoring bills that were people-oriented. The various chairmen of the wards thanked the governor for his developmental strides and for leading the campaign train to the LGA.
