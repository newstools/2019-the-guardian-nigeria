We are all familiar with New Year resolutions. However, it can easily become cliché when we do not achieve our often-unrealistic goals.
Yet, we know, if we are being honest, there are habits that just need to go with 2018 if we must aspire higher. ticking now on check boxes on blackboard Yes, you know this one. You are probably giving excuses right now and there are perhaps, “a good deal of research” findings on why procrastination applies to the intelligent. Procrastination not only alters your productivity level, but it also piles up unfinished workload. Every time you feel like procrastinating, spare a thought to think of if you will rather rest or work on something that would have been done yesterday. How you respond to a situation determines its turnout.

Understand that you are important and whatever it is you are bringing to the table is important. In 2019, bending our backs to please people who do not appreciate us is not happening.

It is alright to be selfish with your peace of mind especially when the energy has implications that can ruin your mood, your day and opportunities.
