Enugu Rangers had to come from 0-1 down yesterday to beat Bantu FC of Lesotho 2-1 and qualify for the group stage of the CAF Confederation Cup on a 4-2 goals aggregate.Rangers won the first leg in Maseru 2-1, giving their fans the assurance that the Flying Antelopes would complete the job at home at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium, Enugu. But they were given a rude shock at home by the Southern Africans, who opened scores in the 13th minute through Lehlohonold Fothoame. Rangers, however, responded in the 19th minute through Ajani Ibrahim, while Aguda Godwin deflated the boys from Maseru in the 21st minute. Yesterday’s game was expected by many to be a walk over for Rangers, who totally outclassed Bantu FC in the away leg. But the Flying Antelopes met a different team, which had ambitions of their own. They swamped on the home team, looking for a shock win. But they met a superior side, who switched to a higher gear when it became obvious that the Southern Africans had ‘bad intensions.’Speaking at the end of the game, Rangers Coach, Gbenga Ogunbote said he would continue to work on his side to get them ready for the group stage, “where we will meet tougher teams.”CAF is expected to conduct the Confederation Cup’s group stage draw this week.
