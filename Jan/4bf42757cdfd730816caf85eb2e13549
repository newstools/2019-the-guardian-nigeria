Mariah Carey says she was betrayed by her assistant, Lianna Shakhnazarian, who secretly recorded her doing embarrassing things. The music star claims that her assistant threatened to release the videos unless the singer paid her $8 million(N2,912,000,000), TMZ reports. Mariah says she hired Lianna in March 2015 as an Executive Assistant. The music star claims Lianna went to town with her credit card, buying personal stuff and using Mariah’s name to get discounts. Mariah says unknown to her, Lianna was secretly recording her personal activities which would be damaging to both her personal life and profession. Lianna was paid  $327,000( 119,028,000)  but was fired in November 2017, and that’s when Mariah claims the blackmail began. TMZ reports that the lawsuit does not say what’s on the videos, however, some are described as  being intimate. Mariah is suing for damages in more than $3 million.
