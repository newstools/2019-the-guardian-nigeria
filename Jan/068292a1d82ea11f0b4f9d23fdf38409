 [FILES] Kaduna town. PHOTO: YouTube  Both children, men, women, old and young were seen scampering to safety in Ungwan-boro area of Chikun local government area of Kaduna when a three phase unit transformer blew up, which many mistook for a bomb blast. The incident threw up residents in the area into shock due to the hail of dust that accompanied the blast, in the area less than two kilometers from Kasuwan Magani. The vibration from the blast forced many out of their shelters. An eyewitness said it was a traumatizing experience. The eyewitness account also said no casualty was recorded but people, especially passersby and motorists were running over fear of another explosion as they abandoned their vehicles. They later discovered that the blast was caused by flying birds and doves that jumped on the wires. Despite the explosion, power supply remained intact in some part of the area connected to the transformer, to many peopleâ€™s amazement. When contacted on phone, the spokesman of the Kaduna Electric, Idris Mohammed could not respond  at the time of filing this report.
