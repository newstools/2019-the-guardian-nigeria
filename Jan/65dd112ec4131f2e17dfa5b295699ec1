Oluwarotimi Akeredolu on Administration and Policy Planning, made the call in Akure at a press conference to herald the Ondo State Security Summit slated for Thursday. Ogunmusire, who is also the Chairman of the planning committee on the summit, explained that it became imperative to hold the summit in the face of the security challenges in the state. “In light of the developmental efforts of the Ondo state government to attract capital inflow to the state, it is imperative that we create an enabling environment for investors and their investments. “The geographical location of Ondo State is such that people with criminal tendencies make an inroad into the state from neighbouring states,” he said. He also said no fewer than 500 participants  had been invited for the summit with the theme: “Improving Security Architecture in Ondo State for Sustainable Peace and Development.’’ “Eight other sub-themes have been built around this main theme and security experts have been sourced from across the country to critically examine all security issues pertaining to the summit. “It is our hope that ideas and recommendations that will emerge from this summit will be harvested, processed and packaged into a draft security policy document that will be submitted to the governor for the consideration of the State Security Council,” he said.
