Despite yesterday’s meeting between the Federal Government and labour unions, the organised body has insisted that it will hold its planned protests and rallies across the country today. The protest is to draw attention to government’s inability to transmit the N30, 000 new national minimum wage bill to the National Assembly. Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, and his counterparts in the Ministery of Finance and that of the National Budget and Planning, had led the Federal Government team to a crucial meeting yesterday, which the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Trade Union Congress (TUC) and other labour unions attended. Speaking with The Guardian, Deputy General Secretary of the United Labour Congress (ULC), Chris Onyeka, said today’s protest is a national day of mourning. General Secretary of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Dr. Peter Ozo-Eson, stated this in Abuja yesterday that labour would announce a date for national strike, if it becomes absolutely necessary, saying: “When a date is decided for the commencement of a strike, we will inform the public appropriately.” In Delta State, Chairman of the NLC, Jonathan Jemirieyigbe, in an emergency State Executive Council (SEC) meeting yesterday, also dismissed rumour of strike. He said the rally would involve walking on major roads in the state capital, Asaba to Government House, where a letter would be delivered to the state governor. Similarly, the General Overseer of thee Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG, Worldwide), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has appealed for dialogue to avert a looming strike by labour unions. While urging labour to be patient, he asked the federal and state governments to come up with an appreciable minimum wage that would enhance the standard of living of the masses. He made the plea at the headquarters of the RCCG, Throne of Grace, Ebute-Metta during the Annual Thanksgiving Service with the theme: “Cloud of Glory.” The General Overseer, who spoke through the Assistant General Overseer, (RCCG), Pastor Johnson Odesola, expressed reservation on the position of the government on the contentious minimum wage. He further called on the Federal Government to do the needful to end the strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU).
