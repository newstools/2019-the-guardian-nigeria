Women In Social Impact and Women In Technology make up the final two sectors of this very exciting competition. It really has been a very difficult process to narrow it down to these lists, and we thank the section of the public that is supporting these accomplished women by nominating them in the first place. There will only be one final winner per category, however, every woman on our lists of nominees is a true winner who will enjoy well-deserved international recognition in coming months. We hope these women will encourage more investors into Nigeria. As always, we’ve kept their role descriptions (in brackets) deliberately brief, as these women have their main professions, but they are taking things further by driving social change so they may be engaged in other activities. Most of our nominees for Technology, for instance, crossed over into the Social Impact space, and the Social Impact nominees stem from a diverse variety of sectors ranging from Medicine to The Environment. We need more of such women in Nigeria – women giving back – and we are very proud to see the work being done so far. These women are setting encouraging examples. A huge congratulations to everyone on these final two lists and we commend you for the impact you are making. Please note, that the nominees are listed in alphabetical order, not according to how many nominations they received. The Women In Social Impact category recognises women who have made very significant contributions in the sphere of social investment and development of the country as a whole, and have demonstrated that they are committed to the improvement of the quality of life of Nigeria’s people, especially its women. The real contenders who made our shortlist were those women who have contributed to the facilitation of access to financial inclusion and/or health and/or education for all.
We now consider the final list of women, Women In Technology. Technology can make the near-impossible possible in Nigeria. It connects the dots, and applies to all walks of life. This category recognises women who have made significant contributions to create or drive innovative technology that enables, for example, Social Entrepreneurs, The Government and Impact Investors to drive the development of the country as a whole. These women are creative and have excelled in the research and development of the types of technology needed to advance and improve Nigeria’s overall infrastructure. They are true problem-solvers who go that extra mile to drive e.g. web and/or mobile-based solutions to overcome the social problems Nigeria faces, and are contributing to access to technology for all across the country. We were looking for women who are experts or drivers in Fintech, technology for healthcare, or trailblazers for STEM education. Nominees also demonstrated a contribution to the elevation of women working in the Technology Sector in Nigeria. Technology is everything. Women In Social Impact

During the course of us working on the list of nominations for our last two sectors, we found that Dr Maymunah Kadiri (Pinnacle Health Radio Founder), was nominated for Women In Social Impact. However, after careful consideration we deem that she is better placed as a contender for the Women In Health & Wellness Award, due to her service in the area of mental health, an ever-increasingly recognised area of our health and wellbeing. Congratulations to her for her service in this sector, and for also being recognised by voters for having a social impact during the course of her work.
