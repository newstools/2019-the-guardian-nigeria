Burna Boy has finally responded via his Instagram stories to people trolling him for his “African Giant” statement to the Coachella organisers. He further explained that his remark “didn’t come from a place of pride or entitlement” but rather from his “Vision of the future of AFRICA not just AFRICAN music.” He stated that “he represents a whole generation of SOLID African CREATIVES GOING Global. Not the soft, low self-esteem Africans with the slave mentality” he also said he would grant an interview soon to make himself understood. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-825876 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0756-532x1152.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="2165" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0756-532x1152.jpg 532w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0756-276x598.jpg 276w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0756-257x557.jpg 257w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0756-515x1114.jpg 515w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0756-111x240.jpg 111w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0756-222x480.jpg 222w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0756-277x600.jpg 277w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0756.jpg 946w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /> Although he has tried to clarify the situation, fans are still upset stating that he overreacted and that was the standard design for Coachella lineup. They further pointed out that last year when Wizkid was set to perform, his name was written in a similar font so Burna Boy’s complaint wasn’t justified. We would simply have to wait for him to have the interview he mentioned so he can offer clarity and further insight to what he really meant.
