The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has released the list of successful candidates for 2018 recruitment exercise. The forces’ Public Education Officer, Bisi Kazeem, made this known on Thursday in reaction to the allegations that FRSC carried out “secret recruitment”. “There is nothing like secret recruitment. Successful candidates have been contacted via the e-mail they applied through,” Kazeem said. He stated that the process was transparent, adding that the successful candidates have already been contacted. “Again, only successful candidates were contacted as it is expected and rational,” he said. When asked to give more details on the matter, he noted that the new recruits were already receiving training in locations across Nigeria. “They are currently in three locations. These are the FRSC Academy in Enugu, the Training School in Jos (Plateau State) and our camp in Kotagora (Niger State),” he said.
