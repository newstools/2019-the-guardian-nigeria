Allianz Nigeria, a global leader in insurance underwriting and asset management, has rolled out plans to be a strong contender for best workplace in 2019. This is even as the company has put in place policies that will distinguish it as well as encourage its workforce to give out their best while satisfying customers.Among the initiatives put in place were flexi-hour, dress policy and, benefits and remuneration On the flexi-hour, the employees can choose to resume as early as 7am or as late as 10am provided they put in the required eight hours of work (plus a one-hour lunch break). So if a worker resumes by 7am, he can hit the close of work by 4pm.On dress policy, the company said daily traditional attire is allowed. The Human Resources Manager, Ifeleke Aboyeji, explained that the company wants its people to ‘dress the culture’.She said: “This contributes greatly to the ambience of the workplace. Employees are free to put on traditional attires that are both trendy and comfortable. “In my interactions with employees, I detected that people are generally happy about this flexibility in our dress culture”, she concludes.On benefits/Remuneration, Aboyeji said Allianz Nigeria may not boast of the most robust incentive package out there, but as an employee puts it, “the timeliness of our monthly remuneration is as dependable as sunlight.” She said that Allianz Nigeria has a standing policy of paying out monthly benefits on the same day each month. Where the day falls on a weekend or public holiday, payout is the working day immediately before. On the likelihood of abuses by some employees, the  Executive Director of the company, Owolabi Salami replied: “There are however, concerns about the abuse of such a policy. We really don’t care. For us it is substance over form.“We trust our people to do the right thing even when no one is watching, and for the past two years our people have made us absolutely proud of the decision to make flexible work hours a company policy”.
