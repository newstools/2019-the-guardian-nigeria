According to confirmed reports, Ycee is no longer signed to the Nigerian music label known as Tinny Entertainment.
The rapper made this known on his Twitter page earlier today, January 14, 2019, in response to a fan who asked if he was still signed to the label.  After his signing with Tinny Entertainment, Ycee rose to acclaim in 2015 with his Condo Single which featured Patoranking and he has since followed with chart topping singles like Jagaban, Omo Alhaji, Link Up, Juice etc.
He also released his first body of work “The First Wave” E.P. which was released by Sony Music Africa, through Tinny Entertainment.. There are no confirmed reasons for this development but claims have emerged that the founder and director of Tinny Entertainment- Arokodare Tinny Timilehin made this decision from a financial stance. Ycee’s announcement is coming in the wake of the upcoming release of his new single, expected on January 29th with a project, under the title, ”Ain’t Nobody Badder Than” (#ANBT) due sometime in the year.
