An Osun State high court sitting in Osogbo, the state capital, on Thursday, sentenced a middle-aged man, Sunday Palms, to death by hanging for murder. The convict was arraigned on December 8, 2014, on a one-count charge of murder, a punishable offence under the law. According to the charge sheet, the offence was contrary to section 316 and punishable under section 319 of the Criminal Code Cap 24, Vol 11, Laws of Osun State, 2002. The prosecution team led by Solicitor General of the state, Mr. Dapo Adeniji, called three witnesses and tendered several statements, which were later admitted in evidence as exhibits. The prosecution told the court that the convict committed the offence on August 20, 2006, when he killed one Isiaka Rafiu, a motorcyclist. He said the body of the deceased was later found some days later on a footpath and it was obvious he had been in a fight with someone before he was over-powered and killed. In his confessional statement, the convict admitted killing the deceased, saying: “I saw the boy ridding Okada. I stopped him to carry me to the farm along Gbogan road, Ikire. On getting to the farm, I asked him to stop. Before leaving my house, I carry a knife and kept inside a poly bag, later I fell him down and I brought my knife and cut his neck. After I saw him dead, I left him and went away with his motorcycle”. In her judgment, the Chief Judge of Osun State, Justice Adepele Ojo, said the prosecutor has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt and thereby sentenced him to death by hanging.
