To promote convenience and deepen the country’s foreign exchange (FX) market, Turtlewax BDC, a foremost Bureau de Change operator in Nigeria, and KiakiaFX, have opened the first digital BDC office in Lekki, Lagos State.The promoters say it would provide Free-Wifi to customers, who perform their FX transactions via channels that promote virtual and digital trading, in which no physical cash is handled.
 
While declaring the office open, the Southwest President, Association of Bureau de Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON), Taiwo Ebenezer, commended the management of Turtle Wax BDC and KiaKiaFX for the feat.
 
“Turtle Wax BDC has been unrelenting in its commitment to changing the Bureau De Change operating landscape in Nigeria and Africa, and what we are witnessing today is a further step in that direction and it deserves commendation,” he said.
 
Speaking, the Managing Director, Turtle Wax BDC, Olatubosun Sanyaolu-Oyo, noted that the essence of the Digital Office is to further bring convenience to its customers, and reduce the difficulties and stress involved in foreign exchange transactions to the barest minimum.
 
His words: “At Turtle Wax BDC, we continually think of innovative ways to make the customer journey easier and seamless, while also delivering unequalled value to all our stakeholders.”
 
Turtle Wax BDC is licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), as a BDC operator, and has been at the forefront of promoting convenience and seamlessness in the foreign exchange business.
 
Its recent partnership with Kiakia FX, an Indigenous Fintech company, has enabled hundreds of customers to buy and sell foreign exchange, conduct transactions in foreign currencies including settling school fees, and other bills from the comfort of their homes, and offices on their desktops, laptops, tablets, and other mobile devices.
 
The Managing Director of KiaKiaFX, Abisoye Coker, said partnering with Turtle Wax BDC in creating innovative cash management technology frameworks that promote near cashless processes in the BDC segment, would eliminate the threats of theft and high insecurity for operators and customers.
