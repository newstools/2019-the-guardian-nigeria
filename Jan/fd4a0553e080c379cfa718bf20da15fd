If you had an important appointment that requires you cross state-lines, your most likely means of transportation would be by air. Well, media personality Nancy Isime thinks that Nigerian airlines cannot be trusted. She took to her insta-stories to rant about how Nigerian airlines cancel flights without notice. According to the HipTv presenter who also doubles as an actress, Nigerian airlines don’t care if your trip is an emergency or a work trip. The star was in Enugu state over the weekend for a film premiere and judging from her rant, she must have had a horrible experience as she goes on to add that Nigerian airlines usually don’t give a good option when flights are cancelled as passengers have to wait for the rescheduled date or book another flight. Ironically, she blamed Nigerians as the cause of the problem and not the government writing, “If the body of the fish is rotten, you sure know the head must be rotten.” It would be recalled that Isime is not the only celebrity who has complained about the state of things with Nigeria’s aviation sector in recent times. Recently, Nigerian music legend, Tuface Idibia appeared to throw shades at the Nigerian government over the state of things with Nigeria’s airports after visiting Accra.
