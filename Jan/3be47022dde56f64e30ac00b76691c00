Kanye West ended 2018 with a very stern and direct message for Drake and it is that the latter should not follow his wife, Kim Kardashian on Instagram. The “Ye” hitmaker issued the message yesterday, December 31, 2018 by saying, “Who’s bright idea was it to tell Drake to follow my wife on Instagram? This person is not Drakes friend.” He then followed it with, “I don’t have beef with no one. Love everyone but don’t follow my f***ing wife on Instagram.” This warning comes just a few days after West allegedly discovered Drake was following Kim. When he made the discovery, he posted and deleted, “I never knew till this morning that Drake followed my wife on Instagram back in September. I had to bring this up because it’s the most f-ked up thing of all and I just saw it this morning.” It would be recalled that earlier in December, the duo of Kim and Kanye issue a warning to Drake when they accused him of threatning their family during a phone call. The call was between Drake and West but Kim also got by saying, “Drake Never threaten my husband or our family. He paved the way for there to be a Drake.” Drake has still yet to respond, other than with a bunch of crying laughing emojis during West’s first Twitter message.
