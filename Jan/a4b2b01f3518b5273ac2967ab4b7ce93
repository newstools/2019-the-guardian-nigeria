University of Lagos (UNILAG) on Thursday became the first Nigerian campus to own a television state when UNILAG TV commenced airing operation. The same university pioneered campus radio broadcast with Radio Unilag 103.1 FM in December 2004. “The new and the first campus television station would fly on the platform of StarTimes digital broadcast Channel, 184. The TV station which boasts of state of the art technical facilities would deliver premier local, national and international news as they unfold,” UNILAG deputy registrar Adebisi Seth Dare said in a statement. Dare said, “The new station, will also serve as a reference point in sports, documentaries, quality entertainment, and as an instrument of educational advancement.” The deputy registrar, who expressed optimism in UNILAG TV to meet audience needs with standard production, said the university “aims to make the new campus television the most trusted news source in Nigeria by being impartial, creative, factual, credible, timely and innovative.” UNILAG Pro-Chancellor, Dr. Wale Babalakin, urged the university to be the source of outstanding intellectual discourse, accurate news and solutions to societal problems. “I hope this station will be the centre of very interesting discussions. I am hoping that it will be a centre of correct and accurate news and will begin the end of fake news in Nigeria.” “We are hoping that it will bring back the vibrancy of intellectual discourse and become a great centre. I really look forward to you providing what is missing today,” Babalakin said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
