Football star, Cristiano Ronaldo has been ordered to pay N7,633,500,000 ($21 million) fine as punishment in his tax fraud case. This should not be such a huge amount of money for the star who earns around N32,715,000,000 ($90 million) a year to cough out since it means he won’t have to serve a 23-month prison sentence. We learn that the 33-year-old appeared in court in Spain earlier today and was seen holding hands with his girlfriend, Georgina Rodriguez with a smile plastered on his face. It was as if he knew that today’s case was no big deal as he had previously agreed to a plea deal with prosecutors and today’s court date was just a formality to make it official.

He was facing a 23-month prison sentence but he was able to secure a deal to pay the fine and move on with his life. It also came in handy for him that a first-time offender in Spain is sentenced to less than 24 months in prison and can serve probation instead of being locked up. This is just one of Ronaldo’s many legal issues as it would be recalled that he has been sued in the United States by a woman who claims he raped her in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009. With police still investigating, he continues to maintain his innocence. Read More: Cristiano Ronaldo To Submit DNA In Vegas Rape Case
