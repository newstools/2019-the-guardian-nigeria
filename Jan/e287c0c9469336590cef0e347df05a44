The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Tuesday denied that its operatives raided the Abuja residence of Chief Justice of Nigeria Justice Walter Onnoghen in order to arrest him. “This is not only a figment of the imagination of the purveyor of the fake news, but an evil machination by the creator and carriers of the news aimed at creating anarchy in the country,” EFCC’s spokesman Tony Orilade said on Tuesday. A former minister of aviation and a chieftain of the opposition People’s Democratic Party claimed earlier on Tuesday that EFCC agents surrounded Onnoghen’s residence in Abuja to arrest him. “Why have the EFCC surrounded the home of CJN Onnoghen and why are they seeking to arrest him,” Femi Fani-Kayode tweeted. “These people want Nigeria to burn! Buhari call off your dogs before it is too late! This is a democracy and not a gestapo state! In the name of God let this madness stop.” The Nigerian government is suing the CJN for “refusal to declare his assets in breach of the provision of the Code of Conduct Bureau Act.” “He is also being accused of maintaining domiciliary foreign currencies account which comprised Dollars Account, Pound Sterling Account and Euro Account which are alleged to be contrary to relevant laws, especially for public office holders.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
