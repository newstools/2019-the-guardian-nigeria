An unusual fear greeted Friday morning in Ikorodu area of Lagos as a tanker bearing petroleum product fell and spilled its content on the road. The Guardian gathered that the tanker fell after discharging some of its content at a filling station in Ebute area of Ikorodu and was heading to another filling station in Ikorodu town when it lost balance. The spillage of the content happened immediately after the tanker fell at about 5:30 am Friday. Security officials were quick to prevent further havoc on the road as policemen on duty along Ikorodu General Hospital road barricaded the road from motorists and pedestrians. Motorists and pedestrians had to suspend their movement along the major road to and fro Ikorodu-Ebute rout to use Solebo road to connect to Ikorodu from Ebute and vice versa. The diversion in movement made motorists increase transport fares. Ebute to Ikorodu which costs N50 was hiked to N100. This forced some person trek their way to Ikorodu town.
