A former aide of ex-Presidents Goodluck Jonathan and Olusegun Obasanjo, Doyin Okupe, Friday tweeted a fake picture to distort the reality of what really happened during the People’s Democratic Party’s campaign at Dutse Jigawa state. The flag-off of campaigns by the party in Jigawa State was held on Thursday with the party bigwigs – former governors of Jigawa, Niger and Kaduna – Sule Lamido, Babangida Aliyu, Ahmed Makarfi and Ramalan Yero respectively in attendance. Okupe posted an image on his Twitter page to show massive turnout at the campaign with the caption “Pdp governorship campaign rally in Dutse Jigawa state 3rd Jan 2019” <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-826781 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image-1-336x598.png" alt="" width="336" height="598" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image-1-336x598.png 336w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image-1-313x557.png 313w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image-1-135x240.png 135w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image-1-270x480.png 270w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image-1.png 405w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" /> He has since deleted the picture from his handle. The image, which has garnered 45 retweets and 129 likes as at report time, is a recycled picture that has been on the internet before January 3, 2018. The Guardian observed that the image was not showing any flag, banner nor party shirt of the PDP. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-826782 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Doyin-fake-1062x475.jpg" alt="" width="1062" height="475" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Doyin-fake-1062x475.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Doyin-fake-487x218.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Doyin-fake-974x436.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Doyin-fake-320x143.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Doyin-fake-640x286.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Doyin-fake-600x269.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1062px) 100vw, 1062px" /> We found that the same picture most likely first appeared online on September 10, 2017, to illustrate in preparation of “Ambazonia Independence.” A Facebook page, BBCC HAUSA NG, on 19 February 2018 also used it. What is certain, however, is that the image did not come from PDP governorship campaign rally in Dutse Jigawa state.
