The suspended Chief of Nigeria Justice Walter Onnoghen has appealed the ruling of the Code of Conduct Tribunal, ordering his suspension. In the appeal, Onnoghen pleaded that the chairman of the CCT and a member Julie Anabor defiled the law and violated the Constitution when they ordered his suspension. He also affirmed that they violated his fundamental right to a fair hearing by not giving him a room for fair hearing. The embattled CJN asked the court to void the ruling of the CCT asking for his resignation as the Chief Justice of Nigeria and chairman of the NJC. Nigeria president Muhammadu Buhari on Friday swore in Ibrahim Tanko Muhammed as the new acting Chief Justice of Nigeria to replace embattled Onnoghen. His swearing-in followed Onnoghen’s suspension by the president, who acted based on an order by the Code of Conduct Tribunal. Onnoghen is facing a six-count charge of non-declaration of assets when he became the chief justice of Nigeria. Buhari said the allegations against Onnoghen were “grievous enough”. Onnoghen’s suspension sparked reactions from Nigerians including the U.S. and Uk government. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
