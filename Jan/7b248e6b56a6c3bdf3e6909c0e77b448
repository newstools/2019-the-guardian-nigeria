 Yemi Osinbajo  The vice president gave the assurance yesterday, while responding to requests made by the Bagii of Saki, High Chief Adegoke Ghazaal Abdul-Rasheed. Osinbajo said: “Oke-Ogun is very important and strategic. Oke-Ogun deserves a Federal institution. They have seen what Chief Awolowo saw.    We need to elect honest people if we want progress. We may be prayerful but we need to elect credible and honest people to engender development. “ Let’s look at the Trans-border Market, it is part of Free Trade Zone. It is very important; it will be in budget. I will hang it on the Minister of Communications, Barrister Adebayo Shittu. “Corruption and greed are the problems, not the lack of ideas. But we must realise that achieving development comes with pains. That’s what you’re seeing but the future is great and bright. Nobody supported Awolowo but chided him when he started the free education policy. Now we can see the benefits of the policy. We are still enjoying what Awo left behind. We need to leave something behind. The foundation and starting point of a good thing is always painful. Very soon we will see the gains.“Right from the days of Chief Obafemi Awolowo of Action Group (AG), Oke-Ogun people had been progressives, and they are not going back.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
