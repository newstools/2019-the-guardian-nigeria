That’s one of the reasons that I’m here, to try and help that to happen. “I’m ready to go, I’m excited and I can’t wait.” The 32-year-old will be expected to spark a Fulham team who are deep in a relegation battle after losing 2-1 at fellow strugglers Burnley on Saturday. The Cottagers have scored only 20 goals and won just three of their 22 league games despite splashing out around £100 million ($127 million) on new players in the summer following promotion from the Championship. Babel made 146 appearances during his three-and-a-half year spell with Liverpool. He left Anfield in 2011 and played for Hoffenheim, Ajax, Al Ain and Deportivo La Coruna before joining Besiktas in 2017. Fulham vice-chairman Tony Khan added: “Ryan has excelled at playing attacking football on both the club and international stage, and we welcome that experience as we build our squad for a strong second-half push.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
