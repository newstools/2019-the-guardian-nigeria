Few days after criticizing artists like Drake, Tyga, and Kanye West, the “Crank That” rapper created more drama over the weekend by labelling Ariana Grande a thief. The accusation seems to stem from Grande’s newly released single “7 Rings,” which has been compared to Soulja’s 2010 hit “Pretty Boy Swag.” The rapper became aware of the comparison, and shared an Instagram video that played clips of the songs back-to-back with the caption “Arianaaaa?????? Ariana?!” Soulja Boy is 100% convinced that his flow was stolen and on on Saturday, the rapper responded to one of Grande’s tweets in which she thanked several of her friends for inspiring “7 Rings.” Soulja, realizing his name wasn’t included, demanded recognition for the track. <img class="size-full wp-image-838728 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TWEET-1.jpg" alt="" width="1242" height="969" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TWEET-1.jpg 1242w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TWEET-1-766x598.jpg 766w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TWEET-1-487x380.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TWEET-1-974x760.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TWEET-1-308x240.jpg 308w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TWEET-1-615x480.jpg 615w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TWEET-1-600x468.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1242px) 100vw, 1242px" /> His tweets became bolder as Soulja tweeted to Grande to “stop stealing his swag,” and also responded to her Mac Miller tribute post by calling her “a thief.” <img class="size-large wp-image-838730 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TWEET-2-1216x1152.jpg" alt="" width="1216" height="1152" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TWEET-2-1216x1152.jpg 1216w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TWEET-2-631x598.jpg 631w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TWEET-2-487x462.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TWEET-2-974x923.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TWEET-2-253x240.jpg 253w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TWEET-2-507x480.jpg 507w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TWEET-2-600x569.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TWEET-2.jpg 1242w" sizes="(max-width: 1216px) 100vw, 1216px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-838732 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TWEET-3.jpg" alt="" width="1242" height="585" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TWEET-3.jpg 1242w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TWEET-3-1062x500.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TWEET-3-487x229.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TWEET-3-974x459.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TWEET-3-320x151.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TWEET-3-640x301.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TWEET-3-600x283.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1242px) 100vw, 1242px" />
