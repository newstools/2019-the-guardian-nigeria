Yakubu Dogara.<br />Photo: Twitter/HouseNGR<br />  Dogara, in a New Year message, also urged the citizenry not to despair but look to the future with optimism and absolute faith in the Almighty God as the country moves into 2019. The Speaker, who noted that 2018 was characterised by unprecedented spate of needless killings, decline in the nation’s economy, unemployment, insecurity and other acts of lawlessness due to poor governance, said he was hopeful that 2019 would offer Nigerians a unique opportunity to renew their faith and hope in God and the country, as well as take full control of their destiny. He challenged Nigerians to be patriotic and committed to their civic responsibility by turning out en-masse to elect leaders that would be sensitive to their yearnings and aspirations, provide the requisite security for their lives and property. “The year 2019 presents a unique opportunity for us to take full control of our nation and our destiny. It is also time for us to take responsibility for our own lives, rekindle the spirit of community and strive towards making Nigeria work again in all its ramifications. “On behalf of the leadership and the entire members of the House of Representatives, I wish all Nigerians a happy and prosperous New Year even as I pray that God Almighty will lift our nation to greater heights in the New Year,” he said.
