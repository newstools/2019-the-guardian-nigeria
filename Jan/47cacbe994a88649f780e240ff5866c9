The Premier League home games against Watford, Newcastle and Leicester will all be at the national stadium as the finishing touches are put on their new 62,000-seater home. The Champions League last-16 home leg with Borussia Dortmund on February 13 will also be played at Wembley. Chairman Daniel Levy has apologised to supporters and hopes to provide a further update in the next few weeks. The club are working with contractors and local authorities to determine a schedule for further testing and sign-offs, including the official test events. Spurs are confident they will move into their own ground this season, with the home game against Crystal Palace in the middle of March a potential date. “I should like to apologise to our fans and thank you for your continued patience,” Levy said in a statement on the club’s official website. “The response from those who attended the familiarisation event was great to hear and reinforced our commitment to deliver an exceptional match-day experience for everyone.” Spurs, currently third in the Premier League, were originally due to move into their new home for the start of this season before putting that back to September. They have an agreement with Wembley to stay there for the rest of the campaign if necessary. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
