Hell was let loose when Lifetime aired its docuseries on singer, R. Kelly with the docuseries having many of his alleged sex slaves coming forward to speak on their experiences. Now, one of Kelly’s alleged victims, Asante McGee victims is putting out a challenge to the singer to test if he is, in fact, telling the truth. She wants him to take a lie detector test and do it live on national television. Celebrity gossip site, TMZ spoke with Asante McGee, one of the women who made allegations against Kelly on “Surviving R. Kelly” and according to her, one of the first thing that needs to happen to save other girls she claims are trapped in the “I Believe I Can Fly” crooner’s clutches is simple, folks need to wake up. She goes on to say that his longtime fans must stop supporting him and pull back so they can see what’s really going on then hold him accountable for his alleged crimes. It is right after this that McGee went on to make the big request that Kelly undergo a polygraph on TV, where the results can be seen live and no funny business can go down. It would be recalled that McGee was one of the first targets of a now-defunct Facebook page, “Surviving Lies,” which painted her as a liar with “evidence” it claimed proved she’d told conflicting stories about Kelly. Facebook removed the page entirely, shortly after it went up. It waits to be seen whether Kelly will take up her challenge to prove his innocence since he has been maintaining that Lifetime painted him bad in the docuseries. You can watch a clip of McGee from the docuseries below as she speaks about her experiences with Kelly.  It is noteworthy that shortly after the docuseries was released, a spike in Kelly’s music sale was witnessed despite Kelly saying he would go ahead to sue Lifetime for the docuseries.
