Senator Shehu Sani, representing Kaduna Central, has accused Governor Nasir El-Rufai of promoting hate speech against him through comments by his wife. He asked the governor to caution his wife over her comments on his hair. In a statement, he said Hadiza, the governor’s wife, always talks about his hair whenever she is out campaigning. He noted that she has been actively involved in the re-election campaign of her husband ahead of the March governorship election. “I appeal to Mr. Governor to caution his wife to stop talking about my hair everywhere she goes on campaigns. Everywhere she goes it’s all about my hair. It’s not my fault if her man is not blessed with hair. I consider it as hate speech. “I will report her to Sheik Gummi or Council of Imams, if she doesn’t stop. Haba Jammaa,” he said.
