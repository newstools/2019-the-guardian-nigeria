Future has joined the bandwagon of celebrities commenting about Surviving R.Kelly. The rapper, Future, stopped by the Power 106 studio for his studio album The Wizrd.  The radio Host, J Cruz, then asked him if he would record with R. Kelly? Future replied: Man, who is that? I thought we had forgot about that? We giving it too much attention. When you give things too much attention, they blow up. That’s why he gon’ blow up. That’s why his music gonna do what it do. If you stop talking about it, it’ll go away. However, Future’s statement offended some people as they said not giving attention means that the allegations will die down and sexual predators will keep going free.  Future’s 2012 Parachute track features R. Kelly and, unlike artists like Lady Gaga and Omarion, the rapper hasn’t made any mention of withdrawing the track with R. Kelly from various steaming platforms.
