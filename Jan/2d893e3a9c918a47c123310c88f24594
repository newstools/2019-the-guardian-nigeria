One of the most notable highlights of summer 2018 was the rap beef between Canadian rapper Drake and G.O.O.D music O.G Pusha T. Although fans thought the game was over after Pusha T exposed Drake’s secret son with ex-pornstar Sophie Brussaux, things seem to be getting heated up again as King Push took to Twitter to send a firm, and final warning to his opponent, promising dire consequences. “You tried, you failed,” he begins. “I’m hearing you wanna try again, this time I’m not gonna play with you, any of you.” Though he’s not calling out names per se, the message is quite clear. After all, the feud was never properly resolved, and there is definitely still some animosity lingering on both sides. The fact that Drake failed to respond after Pusha T delivered what most people viewed as a fatal blow with his diss track Story of Adidon the whole fiasco was obviously getting “deeper than rap.” Perhaps Pusha T has been catching wind of a thing or two that isn’t sitting well with him and has forced him to speak out. Since there has been no public war of words, we are forced to believe that there must’ve been some behind the scenes shenanigans that transpired. Although most people consider the beef to be over and done, it is likely that there just might be a visitation as one camp seems to be geared up already.
