A young man in his early 30s yesterday escaped being lynched to death by angry youths after hitting an okada rider before running into a Diamond Bank branch at Iyana Ipaja area of Lagos State. He was rescued by policemen who were promptly mobilized to the scene to avert a disaster. Narrating what led to incident, the unidentified man who was mobbed, said while walking home, the Okada rider wanted to knock him down and when he tried cautioning the rider, he slapped him, which resulted in him retaliating by hitting him with a phone charger, which caused blood to gush out of the rider.
 
The Okada rider was immediately taken to a nearby hospital for treatment while friends and colleagues of the limping rider stormed the premises of the bank demanding to see the man who hit the rider. Attempts to lynch the man were however thwarted by efforts of policemen and security personnel attached to the bank. It would be recalled that a middle-aged man was nearly lynched by an angry mob for allegedly selling ladies’ pants in Mgbakwu, Awka North local council area of Anambra State at the weekend. The suspect, simply identified as Ifeanyi, a native of Enugu State, was caught in students’ residential quarters while attempting to steal the undies. The suspect confessed to stealing over 58 female pants before he was caught by a lady in the early hours of the fateful day.
