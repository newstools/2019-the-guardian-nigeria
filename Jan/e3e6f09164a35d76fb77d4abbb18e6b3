Mother of three Kim Kardashian is making a lot of progress in her campaign to ensure that a huge difference in prison reforms is made and she has been able to achieve that once again. The reality TV star played a major role in helping to get clemency for Tennessee inmate Cyntoia Brown. Cyntoia, imprisoned for 15 years for killing a man who was allegedly using her as a sex slave when she was 16 has been granted clemency by Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam and is set to be released on parole supervision come August 7. It is learnt that Kim recruited her attorney, Shawn Holley to help Brown’s clemency campaign. The campaign started gaining traction when Kim and other stars like Rihanna, LeBron James and Snoop Dogg started bringing attention to her case. Holley offered support, resources and called the District Attorney’s Office on Brown’s behalf. The clemency was granted yesterday, January 7 following a long legal battle. Afterwards, Brown issued a statement saying, “I am thankful for all the support, prayers, and encouragement I have received. I am thankful to my lawyers and their staffs, and all the others who, for the last decade have freely given their time and expertise to help me get to this day. I love all of you and will be forever grateful. With God’s help, I am committed to living the rest of my life helping others, especially young people. My hope is to help other young girls avoid ending up where I have been.” Kim Kardashian and Donald Trump | TMZ It would be recalled that Kim went to the White House last year to meet with President Donald Trump and talk clemency and prison reform.
