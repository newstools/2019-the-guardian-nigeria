He said the essence of the W&YPC team is a political innovation that will take President Buhari’s reelection campaign to the grassroots and household to household. According to him: “The W&YC Team is to support and complement the Presidential Campaign Council (PCC). As we know, the PCC is headed by President Buhari himself, co-chaired by the able and esteemed national leader of the party, former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. “The W&YPC team is also ably headed by Aisha Buhari, wife of the president as chairperson, with Mrs. Dolapo Osinbajo, wife of the vice president as co-chair.” He added this is definitely a new addition to the political lexicon in Nigeria for two presidential campaign organisations, for the same platform, to run side by side. This is innovative, imaginative and strategic and will enhance the potency of the campaign as a whole, he explained. Similarly, Marwa has enjoined former President Olusegun Obasanjo and former Head of State, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, to back the re-election bid of President Buhari. Marwa, who spoke with reporters in Abuja, said that Buhari’s campaign team would persuade the duo for their endorsement as they embark on a household campaign across the country.
