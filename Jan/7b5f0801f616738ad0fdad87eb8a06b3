Award-winning Nollywood star, Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde is loved by many, not just for her acting skills but also her kind heart. Popular referred to as Omosexy, the screen star has made a difference in the lives of so many widows and orphans through her “Give and Let Give initiative”. As a way of rounding up 2018, the mother of four surprised a widow identified as Folashade Chijioke in a good way by helping to renovate her home in just four days. The widow was nominated after many entries via emails by another widow. Some of the criteria for selection were that the widow being nominated must be a working woman, giving back to the community and raising her kids. It is gathered that Folashade’s home was given renovated with new furniture, a new paint job, bathroom fittings, an upgraded kitchen, bunk beds and cosy mattresses, a TV, fridge, and gas cooker. They were then taken back to their home from the hotel they had been staying at during the renovation and they were shown their new home on the 31st of December. Check out the photos below:
