German coach Imke Wubbenhorst had the perfect answer to a sexist question asked by a journalist. She responded sarcastically that she selects her team’s list based on the penis size of the players. Imke Wubbenhorst, who is the first female to coach a male team in Germany’s fifth tier side BV Cloppenburg, said this while responding to questions from journalists. She told a German TV Welt how one journalist had asked her whether she warned players to put their pants on when she entered the dressing room. “Of course not, I’m a professional,” she responded, sarcastically. “I pick my players based on their penis size,” Wubbenhorst said. Wubbenhorst, who is a former German youth international, is not the first female coach to face condescending or sexist questions. When former Sweden women’s team manager Pia Sundhage was asked in 2014 whether a woman was able to coach a men’s team, she replied: “Well [German chancellor] Angela Merkel runs a whole country.” Sundhage had already won two Olympic golds as manager of the United States. Fortunately, Cloppenburg’s owners are more forward thinking, saying “We only looked at quality.” “It was an easy decision to let go of gender in the evaluation process,” said board member Herbert Schroder. Wubbenhorst, 30, had been in charge of Cloppenburg’s women’s team but the club decided she would be better placed helping the relegation-threatened men’s side. Cloppenburg currently sits bottom of the league. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
