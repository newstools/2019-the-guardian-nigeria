 Vimbai  TheVimbai.com is every African girl’s big sister and a movement of inspired thinkers, dreamers and game-changers. Specifically created for African women by African women, the website is home to cutting edge editorial content as well as original video series that speak to the real-life issues we are all talking about behind closed doors. Speaking on what inspired her to embark on this project, Vimbai says: “I became known as the “table-shaker” last year when I posted a truth in passing. After receiving thousands of emails from across Africa as a result of this post, I realized that not only are people hungry to start having so-called taboo conversations in public, we are also ready to have a platform to learn, analyse and dissect unpopular truths in our society. My platform is an enlightened place for women to do so.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
