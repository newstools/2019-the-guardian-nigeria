About 20 officers of the police were at Melaye’s residence on Friday, December 28 to arrest the lawmaker representing Kogi West senatorial district. But he did not surrender to the Police, saying he was not in Abuja. Melaye is currently standing trial in more than one suit. He has been accused of illegal possession of arms, gun running and sponsoring hoodlums in Kogi State. In a sperate trial, he was accused of a six-count charge, bordering on attempted suicide, attempt to escape from custody and damage of police property. Police spokesman Jimoh Moshood said the shooting and injuries on a police officer by Senator Dino Melaye and his armed thugs in Kogi State on the 19th July 2018 warranted his arrest. He added that the police officer was yet to recover from the gunshot injury he sustained during the attack and was under intensive medical care. Melaye, however, challenged the police to be responsible for securing the lives of Nigerians, rather than seeking the arrest of an innocent citizen like himself. He told the Nigeria Police that the siege laid on his Abuja residence by security operatives was uncalled for, saying he is not a criminal. An Abuja high court had on Thursday refused to grant Dino Melaye’s application to order the removal of police blockage on his residence.
