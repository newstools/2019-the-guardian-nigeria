Ace Nigerian comedian Seyi Law has spoken about those he considers to be his greatest enemies in life. The 35-year-old laugh master took to his Instagram page to disclose that the people he has trusted the most in his life have been his greatest enemies. He also reflected on how one of the most profound lessons he has learnt in life is that strangers will have limited chances of harming a person if close relatives do not talk. He shared, “Yesterday, my wife spotted my first grey hair and I began to ask myself what wisdom have I gained from life. One of the most profound lessons is, if those who live indoors with you don’t talk, those outdoor will have limited chance of harming you,” he wrote. “It took Judas to sell out Jesus. It took Joseph’s brother to sell him to slavery and it took Ahithophel to destroy David’s house, but in all of these with all their evil, there is a fulfilment of purpose despite the hurts. “Those who I have trusted the most have been my greatest enemies, always talking without been asked or succumbing to lies about me, but as I leave them behind, God always opens a new chapter that celebrates His Grace and Glory in my life that they always wished they were a part of.”
