[FILE] Car crash Photo credit: Instagram An inconsolable social media user, Temitope Hammed has shared on Facebook details of how a drunken yahoo boy killed her seven friends on Friday night while they were performing ablution at a mosque along the Moshood Abiola way in Abeokuta, Ogun State. According to Hammed, the Toyota Avensis car, which the said drunk yahoo boy was driving lost control after a tyre burst, somersaulted and crushed four students of the Government Technical College and one other person to death. The spokesperson for the Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE), Mr Babatunde Akinbiyi, who confirmed the incident, said that the accident occurred around 10:40 pm. He said, “the vehicle lost control due to tyre burst and speeding, somersaulted and went to meet people sitting down outside a house instantly killing five of them and injuring two others — four female college students and a little girl.” “We learnt they were students of Government Technical College, Abeokuta. They came for a Muslim programme called Tahajjud, which was to start by 12 am but were still outside around 10:30 pm, waiting for 12 am to enter a nearby mosque where the programme would take place before the incident happened. “Alcoholic drinks were found in the car and unfortunately the driver of the car could not be located, ” he added. However, Hammed, who is an older sister to one of the four girls crushed to death by the drunken driver, Misturat Titilope Hammed, pointed accusing fingers at the “Yahoo-boy”, and claimed that it was a kind of sacrifice. She stressed that her reason stems from the fact that there was no single drop of blood at the scene of the accident, despite the fact that the remains of the victims were seriously wounded and mutilated.
