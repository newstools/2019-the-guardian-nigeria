Secondus made the statement, yesterday, at the Kannywood movie industry’s interactive session with the party’s presidential candidate, Atiku  Abubakar,  whose candidature was endorsed by the movie industry. He  gave assurance that Atiku would unlock young Nigerians’ potentials in Kannywood and Nollywood when elected, adding that  PDP has established a ‘Generation Next’ platform to ensure youths’ capacity is developed. Atiku said one of his priorities is to bring back the support earlier denied by the present administration, while providing jobs for youths. The presidential hopeful represented by his Campaign Director General, Senate President, Bukola  Saraki recalled that the last administration under President Goodluck Jonathan pledged to support the movie industry with $200m, but unfortunately, the Buhari led government revoked the support. Meanwhile, his wife, Dr. (Mrs.) Jennifer Douglas-Abubakar yesterday led thousands of Delta State women to pray for peace and unity in Nigeria. She called on them to be courageous and rise in defense of the nation’s democracy, despite the current political tension generated by the suspension of the Chief Justice ofNigeria (CJN), Mr. Justice Walter Onnoghen. Douglas-Abubakar, while praying for peaceful general elections in Asaba, said, the country could not afford to go to war, despite all provocative tendencies in the country.
