The third edition of the 2019 Soundcity MVP awards was all shades of lit. The awards show which held at the Eko Hotels saw celebrities stun in all their glory with their outfits and had artistes such as Slimcase talk about his collaboration with Cardi B and Rihanna. Although the awards show started early into the morning, viewers and the audience were treated to hit songs and live performances. The awards saw many surprises as Patoranking clinched the “Video of the Year” for Heal the world; Busisa took home the Best Female MVP and Burna Boy’s mother promising us more “madness” in 2019 after two wins.
