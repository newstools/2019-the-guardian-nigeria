Screenshot of Surviving Lies Facebook page The drama of allegations is getting intense as there continues to be a back and forth between embattled singer, R. Kelly and his accusers who allege that he made them sex slaves. In a new report, it has been learnt that Kelly is reportedly set to tell his side of the story via a new program tagged “Surviving Lies”. This move is coming after Lifetime’s docu-series “Surviving R. Kelly” with victims coming forward to talk about their experiences of sexual abuse from the singer in what he has since called a move  to tarnish his image The RnB legend was accused of horrific abuse by multiple women in the docuseries but he maintains his innocence and intends to “expose” his accusers via a new website called survivinglies.com. We gather that Kelly and his team are in the middle of launching the site and it will reportedly attempt to expose his accusers as liars and expose the motivation behind their allegations. At the moment, the website is not live, but there is a Facebook account with the same name. Asante McGee and R Kelly | Manchikoni We reported earlier that one of the victims, Asante McGee challenged the singer to take a lie detector test on national TV to prove his innocence about the allegations. The website now appears to make her the first target to be discredited and exposed by Kelly. The Facebook page “Surviving Lies” shared a video linked to YouTube. The video features an audio conversation that allegedly features McGee’s daughter and ex-boyfriend exposing her accusations. The people on the audio have not been verified, but the page is claiming that it is McGee’s daughter and ex-boyfriend. It would be recalled that prior to airing the docuseries, Kelly threatened to take legal action against Lifetime should they go ahead to air the docuseries which he claims paints him as a bad person.
