The technology debt-free people are waiting for is here (or not.) China Daily has reported that North China’s Hebei province is taking VERY bold steps to aid you better. Higher People’s Court of Hebei’s aid comes in no other way than a roadmap called “a map of deadbeat debtor” which shows you where your debtors are. People who are familiar with the WeChat platform will understand how this works. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-837214 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Deadbeat-Map.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="674" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Deadbeat-Map.jpg 796w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Deadbeat-Map-487x256.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Deadbeat-Map-320x168.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Deadbeat-Map-640x337.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Deadbeat-Map-600x316.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> The app goes further than this. It shows you where they are within a 500-meter radius, their names, ID numbers and why they are on your list. According to China Daily, this feature is to “make it easier for people to whistle-blow on debtors capable of paying their debts.” A spokesman of the court also adds, “It’s a part of our measures to enforce our rulings and create a socially credible environment.” In 2017 Xinhua News Agency reported that Chinese China had ordered that authorities to “establish online platforms to expose debtors who fail to honour their credit obligations.” “The online platforms will be developed and maintained by local news organizations on the basis of a database provided by local courts.”
