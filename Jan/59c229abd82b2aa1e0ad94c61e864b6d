The Japanese star, who burst to prominence with her eventful US Open final win over Serena Williams, made 26 unforced errors and was broken three times in a disappointing display. She said after the match that she didn’t know how to cope once things started to go against her. “If I’m being really frank, I just feel like I had the worst attitude today,” she said. “I feel like I didn’t really know how to cope with not playing well. “I was sulking a little bit, and like there are moments that I tried not to do that, but then the ball wouldn’t go in, and then I would go back to being, like, childish and stuff. “I feel like last year I did a lot of that,” she added. “I’m trying to change it more, and I think I have.” But Osaka said Saturday’s loss was probably a better learning experience than if she had made the final. “I think today I learned… what I can do to improve the situation,” she said. The 29-year-old Tsurenko, who will now rise to a career-high world ranking of 24, said she had adopted a new game plan during the off-season. “I feel better with my serve and that I am moving well,” she said. “I feel more strong now, so I can kind of handle every kind of pressure on court, even when someone like Naomi is playing really strong. “I can really stay there and I can be aggressive also.” Tsurenko will play either fifth seeded Czech Karolina Pliskova or Croatia’s Donna Vekic in Sunday’s final.
