Regina Daniel has slammed President Muhammadu Buhari in an Instagram post. The teen star who was recently appointed Youth Campaign Coordinator for the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, called the president a myriad of lies. The Nollywood star further disclosed that she has accepted her appointment as a Youth Campaign Coordinator for Atiku. She disclosed that the land bleeds from hunger and inertia. According to her, it is time for Nigerian youths to join her and vote Atiku/Obi 2019 to protect the future. In her Instagram post, she wrote, “I’m Regina Daniels. Proud to be 100% Atikulated with Atiku Abubakar who is in the race to become Nigeria’s next President. I accept my appointment as Youth Campaign Coordinator For Nollywood with humility and youthful zeal. Atiku is a youth-friendly leader who has assured that every 4 out of 10 of his cabinet will be a youth. The drift is brazen. The nation is at crossroads. The land bleeds from hunger and inertia. It’s time to steer the ship away from caput. From Bama to Bori, Aba to Abuja, kaura Namode to Kaduna, the sky is gloomy.
Time for Nigerian Youths to join me and vote Atiku/Obi 2019 to protect our future.”
