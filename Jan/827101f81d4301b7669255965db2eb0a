Two days into the New Year, a Nigerian Disc Jockey (DJ), Seun Omogaji better known as DJ Xgee among social circles committed suicide throwing both the entertainment industry and Nigerians at large into shock. The Lagos-based DJ reportedly took sniper insecticide with several reports claiming he took his own life due to some marital problems he has been having. In an update to the tragic occurrence, his family is shutting down viral rumours surrounding the death of the popular disc jockey.  In a statement the family released, they totally denied that a marital problem is behind his suicide. Read their statement below, “Our attention has been drawn to several publications based on false insinuations and accusations following the demise of our beloved son, Oluwaseun Omogaji of blessed memory. Whilst we sincerely appreciate the concern, love and support shown through this very difficult period, we categorically state that our son, Oluwaseun of blessed memory was happily married to his wife, Omobolanle Omogaji and up to the time of his demise, their union was not estranged as wrongly purported. We hereby appeal to the general public to respect the memory of our late son Oluwaseun Omogaji and the privacy of his widowed wife, children and family he has left behind to grieve and to heal. We thank you again for your support. SIGNED BY THE OMOGAJI AND AJAO FAMILY.” It would be recalled that in his last note on Instagram, he requested that people wear white rather than black when committing him to mother Earth.
