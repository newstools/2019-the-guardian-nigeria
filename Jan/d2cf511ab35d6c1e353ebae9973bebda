The crème de la crème of the rap game have been invited to sessions for Dreamville’s Revenge of The Dreamers III, a rap camp where the goal is to get a lot of talented individuals in one big studio and create another installation in the Revenge of the Dreamers compilation series. J. Cole took to Twitter early Saturday morning to share what progress has been made during the sessions, writing , “Shed tears tonight writin a verse shit was beautiful. Revenge sessions going down in history.” <img class="size-full wp-image-832678 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/J.-Cole-tweet.jpg" alt="" width="1242" height="963" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/J.-Cole-tweet.jpg 1242w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/J.-Cole-tweet-771x598.jpg 771w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/J.-Cole-tweet-487x378.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/J.-Cole-tweet-974x755.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/J.-Cole-tweet-310x240.jpg 310w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/J.-Cole-tweet-619x480.jpg 619w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/J.-Cole-tweet-600x465.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1242px) 100vw, 1242px" /> Revenge of The Dreamers III is coming three years after the Dreamville label dropped the second compilation effort, in 2015. The first installment in the series, Revenge of The Dreamers came in 2014. As expected all the Dreamville members have been present at the sessions: Ari Lennox, Bas, cozz, EarthGang, J.I.D, Omen and Lute. A number of other artists have been invited too such as T.I., Vince Staples, Meek Mill, Saba, Tay Keith and more. It is also worthy of mention that J.cole along with fellow Dreamville artist Bas, was in Nigeria last year, April 2018 for the Castle Lite Unlocks concert where he essentially performed his latest album KOD for the first time in front of an audience and he was shocked to find out that he had such a fan base in the country.
