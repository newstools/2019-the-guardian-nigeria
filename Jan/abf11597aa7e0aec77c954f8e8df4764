We reported last week that rapper The Game is set to drop new music and a preview of some of the new songs was released on Instagram. While fans are excited about his upcoming project, he had everyone riled up when one of the songs has a controversial lyrics of him reportedly having sex with the reality TV star, Kim Kardashian. The said song paints a graphic picture of the rapper having sex with Kardashian as he raps, “I held Kim Kardashian by her throat ni**a/I made her swallow my kids until she choked ni**a/I should apologize, ’cause ‘Ye my folks ni**a/This for all my Vicelords and locs, ni**a.” It appears that she is not the only one from her family he mentions as he brought her sister, Kylie Jenner into the mix, too and apparently did it on the same track. In another clip of Game’s song shared yesterday by DJ Akademiks, he raps about taking care of Jenner with the lyrics, “Her sister made a billion in makeup. I used to make her Frosted Flakes when she wake up.” We have now learnt that Game had plenty of people warn him about dropping the graphic lyric about sex with Kardashian but he chose to stick to his guns, despite risking very personal relationships with members of the Kardashian family. He wouldn’t budge either when business partners and close friends told him not to use the lyrics because of a possible/likely ferocious reaction from Kardashian’s husband, Kanye West. TMZ reports that Game was advised at the very least to reach out to West before dropping the track, but he didn’t feel a heads-up was necessary. He rather chose to rap his truth regardless of the consequences. This is knowing full well that West comes down hard on other rappers for bringing up anything about his wife. It would be recalled that West slammed Drake and Nick Cannon heavily in 2018 for bringing up Kardashian. So far there has been no reaction from West or Kardashian-Jenner about Game’s lyric.
