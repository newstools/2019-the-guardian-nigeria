Photo/twitter: Police  ACP Frank Mba, the Force PRO, disclosed this on Wednesday while appearing on Channels TV programme Sunrise Daily. “What we are doing now is to correct the abnormality, restore order and bring the Police closer to the people,” Mba said. “This is just a tip of the iceberg among very many reforms IGP Mohammed Adamu is bringing in the Force,” he added. Mba opined that the decentralisation of FSARS will bring the police close to the people and reduced bottleneck. The Guardian reported how the acting Inspector General of Police (IGP), Muhammed Adamu, Monday ordered the immediate decentralisation of operations of the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS) unit. Immediate past IGP, Ibrahim Idris, had centralised operations of SARS into FSARS at the force headquarters and placed it under the Deputy Inspector-General of Police (Operations), as part of the reforms of the squad. The decentralisation has since generated controversies. Unfortunately for those celebrating, #EndSARS #ReformPoliceNG just got reborn with this chaotic pronouncement. We are back to where it all started,” Segun Awosanya, ENDSARS convener tweeted on Monday. “This rearrangement is just going to fuel corruption and lure the Commissioners of police into deploying SARS as political party Thugs,” he added. But Mba said the reform will be holistic, noting that the  “reforms on SARS is [sic] not going to be cosmetic.” “We are not going to deal with just nomenclature issues. We are going to carry out deep-rooted reforms that are designed to make not just SARS operatives but the entire officers and men of the Nigeria Police Force to become citizen-centered in the discharge of their duties.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
