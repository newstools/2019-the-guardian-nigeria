The action was to protest against the suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Walter Onnoghen, by President Muhammadu Buhari. A statement at the end of the meeting reads in part: “NEC resolved that members should boycott all courts for the next two days starting from January 29 to 31 2019.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
