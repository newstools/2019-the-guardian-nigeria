 Ndoma-Egba<br />  In a chat with journalists in his Calabar residence yesterday, the former senate leader said he had to point it out because of his detractors who accused him of not being able to attract any project from the NDDC to the state. “Let me say it again; whatever road you see anywhere in the state tarred in the last two years, chances are that 90 per cent of them were done by the NDDC or the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs. “We have roads right from Calabar south and Bakassi to Obanlikwu. I want to be challenged on that. “If you see any school renovated in the last two years with new building and new furniture, the chances are that 90 per cent was done by the NDDC or Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs. So those are the achievements. Until we are challenged, those remain our achievements,” Ndoma-Egba insisted. Enumerating what the state benefitted under the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, the APC senatorial candidate said: “A lot in area of road rehabilitation, worthy to be mentioned was the Calabar/Itu/Ikot Ekpene road, which links Cross River and Akwa Ibom states; the Calabar/Ikom/Obudu road, which was rehabilitated by the NDDC, despite the paltry 28,000 votes given to the president during the 2015 general elections by Cross Riverians.” With these roads rehabilitated by the NDDC, according to him, one can afford to travel the length and breadth of the state under some few hours against the number of hours travel from Calabar to Uyo and Calabar to Ikom and Obudu before the rehabilitation. He added: “In the area of health, we have supplied vaccines to health centres and educational materials to Cross River schools.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
