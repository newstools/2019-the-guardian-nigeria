 Rangers International Technical Adviser, Gbenga Ogunbote  Rangers are currently languishing at the bottom of the NPFL Group A league table with no point after a match, while Enyimba have recorded four points in three games. Today’s encounter, an Oriental derby, however is a battle of two neighbours in one of today’s NPFL’s fixtures. Speaking to The Guardian yesterday on today’s epic match, Ogunbote said he expects his boys to have a better game as against their outing in Lagos when they played NPFL Group A log leaders, the MFM FC, which they lost 0-1 to. “I expect that we raise our game and get ourselves the three points. I know is a local derby, and it is going to be a tough one. Be that as it may, I think we should be able to handle it if we can manage it properly. “We have players who can do the job for us. When the league commences you want to see all the players play, otherwise what is the justification for bringing them into the team. And besides, some of them had played couples of games, and they needed to rest. I mean a passive rest,” he said. The former coach of Enyimba FC, who was disappointed by his team’s result to MFM FC despite dominating the encounter, which he felt they should have won right in the first half of the duel, said: “Players that would feature today depend on availability and readiness. It is only those who are ready that will get to play in the match from among the crop of players we have with us. “However, on behalf of the team, my appeal goes to our supporters. I want to plead with them as regards the loss in Lagos. I still enjoin them to come out en masse and support their darling team to victory in today’s encounter,” he stated.
