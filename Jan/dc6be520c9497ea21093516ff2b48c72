Weigl, usually a defensive midfielder, slotted into defence at centre-back in Leipzig as cover for the Swiss Manuel Akanji, who is sidelined long-term, and was magnificent as Axel Witsel’s first-half strike gave Dortmund the three points. Zorc described Weigl’s performance against Leipzig as “flawless”, even though he was playing out of position, as more than 95 percent of his passes hit their target. US midfielder Christian Pulisic will join Chelsea in July, but Zorc had ruled out the sale of any other Dortmund stars in the current transfer window, which closes in Germany at 1700 GMT on January 31, as “we don’t want to let go of the players we need to achieve our goals”. Reports emerged last week that Weigl has been in contact with PSG’s former Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel, who gave the 23-year-old his Bundesliga debut in 2015. In December, AS Roma and Arsenal were both also reportedly interested in signing Weigl, who has made five appearances for Germany. Dortmund host second-from-bottom Hanover 96 next Saturday and Zorc says club captain and playmaker Marco Reus is expected to only be out for “one or perhaps two weeks maximum” after picking up an injury in training on Friday.
