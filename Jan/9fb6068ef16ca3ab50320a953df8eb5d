Enugu State chapter of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has expressed support for Ohanaeze Ndigbo’s endorsement of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar. The NLC political committee chairman Ikechukwu Ekere and secretary Pat Eze in a statement said that Ohanaeze reserves right of opinion, free speech and freedom of electoral choices and warned the Anambra state government of the consequence of isolating the people of the state from the wider Igbo. “We, the Igbo, especially our younger ones should learn how to respect our elders which is in tune with our tradition, culture, norms and values of an average Igbo man. On this note we vehemently pledge our loyalty and unalloyed support for the leadership/Ohanaeze Ndigbo, belonging to where they belong,” NLC said. Prior to this, the endorsement of Atiku had split the Igbo communities. Anambra state governor Willy Obiano was alleged to have criticised the leadership of the Igbo community for engaging in partisan politics. Before the public endorsement of Atiku, Ohaneze had said it would not engage in partisan politics. Reacting to the criticism of Ohaneze by governor Obiano, NLC, said, “It is embarrassing and disgusting to learn and hear the utterly vacillating statements made against the leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief John Nnia Nwodo and Ohanaeze in general. The Enugu State NLC said it remained in support of the decision of Ohaneze Ndigbo leadership to support Atiku for the general election.
