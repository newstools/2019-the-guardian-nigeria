Tech giants Samsung has announced it has begun to replace plastic packaging with eco-friendly materials due to criticisms from multiple environmental groups for the inadequacy of green gestures as well as noticing its rivals, such as Apple and T-Mobile who have already started lowering their carbon footprints. As from the first half of 2019 and onwards, the company will use bioplastics, recycled plastics and paper instead of regular plastic as the material of boxes for phones, appliances and other items. The company also decides to redesign products in order to reduce waste. Reportedly, phone chargers will be coated with matte so that plastic protection films will not be needed to keep them unblemished while transporting. Besides plastic, paper will be replaced as well with a more inexhaustible alternative certified by environmental groups and the conversion is set to be completed within two years.
