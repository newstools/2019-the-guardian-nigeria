Cardi B had a great 2018 so much so that she was judged to be the Queen of Rap for the year in question and it appears she will be having a fantastic 2019 as well. The rap star who is already working on new music much to the delight of her fans has now made another major move in her career. It is learnt that she is about to join a rarefied group of superstars, including Michael Jackson, Beyonce and Britney Spears to don Pepsi’s red, white and blue for the company’s Super Bowl ad campaign. According to the celebrity gossip site, TMZ, the mother of one is officially locked as this year’s Pepsi celeb spokesperson and the ad has already been shot and will air during SB 53. The Pepsi spot is considered the premiere commercial during the big game, which is watched by hundreds of millions and has a long afterlife. It would be recalled that American supermodel and actress, Cindy Crawford did the honours last year, and her predecessors include music acts like Pink, One Direction, Madonna, Mariah Carey and The Spice Girls. The Pepsi’s ad is not the only thing Cardi B has going on for her as she is also set to put on a show with Bruno Mars in the days leading up to The Super Bowl, which is expected to be the biggest party of the weekend. It had been early speculated that Cardi B was in talks to join Maroon 5 during the halftime show but negotiations fell apart. It is safe to say that even though we won’t be seeing Cardi B perform on the Super Bowl stage this stage, the monumental Pepsi commercial has ensured that she is still a part of the epic TV moment. Just recently Cardi B slammed the president of the United States, Donald Trump for the partial government lockdown in the country.
