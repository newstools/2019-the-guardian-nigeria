Award-winning comedian and comedian, Kevin Hart has issued another apology to the LGBTQ community once again. This is the second time the screen star is doing this since dropping out of hosting the 2019 Oscar Awards. Hart was on his Straight From the Hart podcast yesterday, January 7th where he got into a deep discussion about his past homophobic jokes and tweets. He admitted that his prior apology to the LGBTQ community had been “chopped up.” During yesterday’s show, Hart said, “Once again, Kevin Hart apologizes for his remarks that hurt members of the LGBTQ community. I apologize.” It would be recalled that it was several years ago when Hart tweeted, “If my son comes home & try’s 2 play with my daughters doll house I’m going 2 break it over his head & say n my voice ‘stop that’s gay.'” Hart also said in one of his comedy specials, “One of my biggest fears is my son growing up and being gay.” We reported that last week Hart appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and DeGeneres seemed to say the gay community is fine with Hart’s vague apology back in 2014 and his more recent post in 2018, in which he said, “I sincerely apologize to the LGBTQ community for my insensitive words from my past.” She also said she reached out to The Academy and they are willing to have Hart host the 2019 Oscars. As at the time of reporting this, however, there is still Still no word on whether or not The Academy has had a change of heart and will ask Hart back.
