Your manuals have also been seen as outstanding and we believe that that is the way to go for the aviation industry. “The DG NCAA is fully aware that everything has come out successfully. We want to wish you the best and we plead that you stick to the regulations. It will help you and it will make out work easier. We look forward to working with you always.”In his response, Leadstream Accountable Manager and the Chief Executive Officer, Engr. Roland Ahmed, expressed gratitude to the NCAA and the certification team. “On behalf of the management of Leadstream Aviation Training, I want to say thank you to the authority. I want to thank the NCAA team headed by Engr. Ameh. At a time, we felt overburdened. “During the process, we were told that the process needs to be balanced. We were told that ‘we are doing this so we can do it right’. At the end of the day, from my heart, I appreciate it. Where we need to go back and forth, we were guided all through,” Ahmed said.
