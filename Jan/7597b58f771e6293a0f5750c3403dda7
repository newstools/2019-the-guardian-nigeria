Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential hopefuls, Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi were on the hot seat today, the 30th of January at the last edition of “The Candidates” which sees presidential candidates defend their strategies ahead of the forthcoming general elections. The defiant interviewer, Ahmed Kadaria was in her usual pose questioning each strategy as Nigerians watched with keen interest for obvious reasons. Atiku and his running mate Obi are the major contenders for the seat of the presidency. However, Kadaria came under attack for allegedly asking tough questions to the hopefuls compared to the incumbent president. I don’t know what @KadariaAhmed is doing with the program. It is looking like an inquest or a trial. I am interosculating the process here with the previous ones. I believe GMB’s was a more friendly chat for obvious reasons. #NgTheCandidates pic.twitter.com/023CtlDMs7 — SEGA L’éveilleur® (@segalink) January 30, 2019  Kadaria is a lightweight, over-hyped journalist who has no knowledge of policy or interrogation skill. Her engagement with Atiku/Obi shows tonight. — Great Oracle (@AbdulMahmud01) January 30, 2019  Where was this energy that Kadaria is bringing with @MBuhari and @ProfOsinbajo though? #NgTheCandidates — Sandra Ezekwesili (@SEzekwesili) January 30, 2019  See their reactions below: Atiku and Obi exceeded my expectations tonight, especially Atiku. I personally didn’t even know he was this sound. As for Peter Obi, mans brought India, Rwanda & S.A into his analogies today since APCists don’t want us to be as great as China. #NgTheCandidates #AtikuObi2019 — FAVOUR ONYEOZIRI (GCFR) (@Rouvafe) January 30, 2019  Nah, I don’t like the combative posture of the interviewer, but Atiku and Obi are holding up well. How many jobs has Buhari created in Katsina State & how much impact has Buhari had on Katsina? #NgTheCandidates — Onye Nkuzi (@cchukudebelu) January 30, 2019  The Money to run the Economy according to @PeterObi will actually be raised by cutting the amount of Money that Government has to raise by itself to fast track development! very deep mindset and a smart way of thinking! And he has actually done it before!#NGTheCandidates — Chinedu Abili-Mordi (@freakiChinedu) January 30, 2019  Atiku: When you reduce Coporate tax, it creates incentives to investors that then employ more people, the people that are employed get taxed. Pardon my French: That was Fucking brilliant!!! #NGTheCandidates #NGcandidates — Adetutu Balogun (@Tutsy22) January 30, 2019  Peter Obi made Kadaria realize she scored an own goal by saying that Atiku is the second highest employer of labour in Adamawa State after the state government  smart as fuck #NGtheCandidates — Ebube Favour (@EbubeFavour4) January 30, 2019  However, some think otherwise: Good call by Kadaria as Peter Obi reels out lies again, claiming that the APC promised a Naira to a Dollar. She says: let’s focus on what you’re doing. #NGTheCandidates — Johannes Tobi W. (@Johannxs) January 30, 2019  I banter a lot but this is not just banter, Peter Obi lies too much for a people’s leader. Someone he respects needs to look him in the face and tell him. — SoulJah (@jeffphilips1) January 30, 2019  #NgTheCandidatesKadaira: Are you saying that all that Obasanjo wrote in his letter to you were lies?Atiku: I'm not hear to answer thatIn his mind: this girl has passed her boundaries pic.twitter.com/SjzjhPLoEZ — Name cannot be blank (@da_ra_01) January 30, 2019  Peter Obi is like that uncle you used to look up to when you were young. Confident, successful and exposed. You know he adds the occasional white lie here and there just to make his stories sound better and you really don’t mind. — Olawale Adetula (@thetoolsman) January 30, 2019
