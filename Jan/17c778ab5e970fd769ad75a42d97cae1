 Gbgoyega Isiaka  Isiaka gave this assurance yesterday in Ota during a rally held to round up a three-day campaign tour of the council, his second in recent weeks. Addressing the crowd of supporters in Igbo-Olori Square, Ota, the ADC flag bearer vowed to pursue his seven-steps to abundance manifesto vigorously and by extension create a working environment for businesses to thrive. He lamented Ota, regarded as the industrial hub of the state, lacks adequate infrastructural development commensurate with its status as the biggest contributor to the state’s internally generated revenue (IGR). He described the council as one with huge economic potential, assuring that his administration, if elected, would “leverage on all opportunities and possibilities around Ota. We have to bring significant development to Ota because of the huge possibilities here.” While soliciting the support of the Yewa/Awori people ahead of the election, Isiaka urged them to reject platforms parading deputy governorship candidates from Ogun West, saying that would not in anyway solve the various challenges and hardships facing the district.
