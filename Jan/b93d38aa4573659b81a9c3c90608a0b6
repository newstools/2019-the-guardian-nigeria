Atlanta rapper Young Thug recently alleged that Lil Wayne is threatening to sue him if he puts out his previously announced album Barter 7. During a live broadcast via his girlfriend Jerrika’s Instagram, Thugger fans were asking when will the rapper begin to drop new music off the upcoming LP. After ignoring the majority of those questions, the Atlanta rapper revealed, “Lil Wayne trying to sue me for that.”  Lil Wayne and Young Thug have had their issues in the past. Back in 2015, Thug released Barter 6 after initially naming the project Carter 6 amidst his beef with Lil Wayne. Tunechi threatened to sue Thug if he released a project that stole the name of the NOLA’s Tha Carter series. The rapper first revealed he was working on Barter 7 EP back in 2017. If Thugger drops that album, it would be Thug’s first project since On the Rvn, which was released late last year.
