The former Commonwealth secretary-general urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct credible elections by ensuring that the result represents the choice of the citizens.“The international community is watching in the area of the federal government and its agencies to see how far they respect the constitution and the rule of law as regards the coming election.” “INEC must remain conscious that the credibility of the result of the coming election will depend on the level of its commitment by making it free and fair and ensuring that the results represent the choice of the citizens,” he added. According to Bishop Matthew Kukah, who was the guest speaker, the country so far has been practising gerontocracy, a government by the old who are not prepared for the position they find themselves. Presidential aspirant of the Young Progressive party (YPP), Kingsley Moghalu, urged the media to be independent by avoiding fake news and narratives about the coming election. At the unveiling, president of the African Newspaper of Nigeria (ANN), Dr. Tokunbo Awolowo-Dosunmu, hinted that unveiling the new Tribune was part of the commitment to renew its legacy as the oldest thriving newspaper in Nigeria.
