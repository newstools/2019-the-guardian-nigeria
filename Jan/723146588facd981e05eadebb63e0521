• Says It’s Sabotage Against Ndigbo The Anambra State government has rejected the purported endorsement issued to the Peoples Democratic Party Presidential Candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and his running mate, Chief Peter Obi by the socio-cultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo. The state government’s position was made known to newsmen, yesterday, by the Secretary to Anambra State Government (SSG), Prof Solo Chukwudobelu, during a press conference held in Agulu, Aniocha Local government Area of Anambra State. Chukwudobelu said Ohanaeze, as the custodian of Igbo custom and culture couldn’t have gone into partisan politics, or involved itself in action capable of dividing Ndigbo, insisting that the action was wrong. He said the Ohanaeze Ime-Obi meeting where the purported endorsement was carried out, was manipulated by the President General of the Organisation, Chief Nnia Nwodu, arguing that some delegates, including Anambra team were excluded. He said: “The Ime Obi meeting was scheduled to start at 7.00pm on Friday in Enugu, but surprisingly, Chief Nwodo and his team gathered themselves and purportedly held the meeting between 5.50pm and 6.30pm before arrival of other delegates. We also condemn in its entirety the fixing of the meeting on the same day the nation was honouring the late Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe of Africa and First President of Nigeria.”
 
The SSG, who was accompanied by the state Commissioner for Information, C-Don Adineba, the Special Assistant to Governor on Political Matters, Chief Ivy Obi-Okoye and Commissioner for Culture/Tourism, Sally Mbanefo, added that such endorsement has potential of setting back Ohanaeze, just as he declared that the action was a sabotage against Anambra State and Ndigbo in the nation’s affairs.
