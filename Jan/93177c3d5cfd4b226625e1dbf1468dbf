The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, who confirmed the report said the incident occurred on Sunday, January 6, 2019. Edgal said at about 9:55p.m. information was received from a credible source that a man was seen moving around Otun Market Square in a suspicious manner, holding a little boy in his hand. He said based on the information, operatives of the command attached to Okokomaiko Division, moved swiftly to the location and arrested the suspect who gave his name as Sikiru Tanimowo, aged 37. “The suspect later led detectives to the location where he picked the child, thus, the police were able to locate his parents who said that they have been looking for the child and have never met the suspect before. The case is currently under investigation with a view to prosecuting the suspect in court, while the child has been reunited with his parents,” he added. Meanwhile, the Lagos State police command has also arrested six suspects for allegedly dispossessing motorists of valuables at gunpoint. Giving details of the arrest, Edgal said: ‘‘On January 2, information was received from a reliable source that some hoodlums, armed with guns and other dangerous weapons, were dispossessing motorists of their valuables around Ajegunle area of Alakuko. ‘‘On receipt of the information, operatives from Alakuko Police Station mobilised to the scene. However, on sighting the policemen, the armed robbers ran in different directions to avoid being arrested but were chased, leading to the arrest of one, who led police to arrest others.
