The 31-year-old joined the premier League outfit on loan until the end of the season. Subject to conditions, the move could be extended by a further 12 months. “I now hope I can give back that trust Chelsea have shown me out on the pitch,” Higuaín told the club’s official website. “I can’t wait to start and I hope to adapt as soon as possible.’ Higuaín previously worked with Sarri at Napoli, scoring 67 goals in 100 appearances during their time together. The striker was linked with a move to Stamford Bridge in the summer but joined Milan instead. The deal was initially a loan but included a €54m obligation to make it permanent at the end of the season. Higuaín went on to score eight goals in 22 Milan appearances. Now he will be expected to contribute heavily to Chelsea’s push for the top four and the club’s run in the Europa League. The striker will wear the number nine shirt at Stamford Bridge.
