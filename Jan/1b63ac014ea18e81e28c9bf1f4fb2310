Newly wedded Nigerian singer, Adekunle Gold in a recent interview with Saturday Beats got emotional and disclosed that he couldn’t save his sister’s life with all the money he had. He further disclosed that her death led to the release of his smash hit song “Ire”, which dedicated to her. Adekunle Gold who referred to his sister as his best friend, disclosed that she died of a heart disease after they spent so much in her treatment. The singer said, “My sister was one of the few best friends I had but death took her away. She had a heart-related disease and I thought she could beat the disease but she did not make it. We sang together a lot and we shared the same dream. I was her best friend in the house, so it really shook me when I lost her. I remember her every year and reminisce about the great time we had together. I wish she was alive to celebrate my success with me because this was our dream. The funny thing is that we had the money; it was not that we could not afford to treat her, but it was just unfortunate that she died. If I was as popular back then as I am now, what would I have done differently? I do not think that I would have done anything differently because we spent money on her. I was at home when she died, so by the time I got to the hospital to see her, she had died.” It would be recalled that Adekunle Gold recently revealed that he and his wife, Simi had a private wedding ceremony because they have an almost obsessive desire for a private life that belongs to just the two of them. Their recent love song, “Promise” has become an instant hit with fans as it gave a glimpse into the lowkey wedding that had just 300 guests in attendance.
