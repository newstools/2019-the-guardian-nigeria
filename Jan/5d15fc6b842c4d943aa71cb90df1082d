The new Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, has decided to retain all serving Deputy Inspectors-General (DIGs).Top police source, who disclosed this yesterday, said four of the DIGs were his course-mates while others have few months to retire from service. Also, a senior officer, who confided in newsmen, said: “Adamu is not prepared to redeploy any police officer in a hurry, the reason he reverted the deployment of Lagos State Police Commissioner, Imohimi Edgal. He wants to stabilise and explore the experiences of the DIGs. Moreover, some of them are his course-mates and he is comfortable working with them. “He has already told them to stay and work with him to move the Force forward. He is an intellectual who would not give in to gossips and unprofessionalism.” The source further revealed that the new IGP doesn’t want to toe the line of the former IGP who recommended the retirement of over 30 cerebral senior officers even when they pledged allegiance to work with him when he took over two years ago as the IGP.
