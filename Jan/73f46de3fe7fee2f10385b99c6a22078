Dr Progress Oyegbeda, the Chief Medical Director of Clear Vision Eye Clinic, Benin, says glaucoma may lead to blindness, if not treated. Oyegbeda told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday in Benin that glaucoma was a condition that caused damage to the eye’s optic nerves, which might worsen over time. He said that glaucoma was often linked to a buildup of pressure inside the eye. “Glaucoma tends to be inherited and may not show up until later in the patient’s life. “The increased pressure, called intra-ocular pressure, can damage the optic nerve. “This increased pressure transmits images to your brain. “If the damage continues, a patient loses his or her eyes permanently,” he said. The optometrist said that some causes of glaucoma included: heredity, chemical injury to the eye, blocked blood vessels inside the eyes and severe eye infection. He added that other causes of glaucoma were aging, trauma from accident, drug abuse, congenital condition in the new-born and other forms of injury. According to  Oyegbeda, the symptoms are: blurred vision, colours may not appear to patient as bright as they are, and light from the sun and lamp seem too bright or glaring. He advised anyone experiencing these symptoms to see an optometrist without any further delay. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
