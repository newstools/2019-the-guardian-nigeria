Despite the fact that the duo was seen jet ski-riding during a vacation in Puerto Rico, she was quick to shut down reports that they were back. She announced that all she missed was his penis but now she is singing a different tune with her longing for some family time with him. It would be recalled we reported earlier that the rap couple were working on fixing their marriage in 2019, with Offset vowing to change his ways and be faithful and honest with her. With her latest post, it is safe to say that they will soon get back to normal and fans of the lovebirds can heave a sigh of relief considering Cardi B had earlier said they were heading towards a divorce. The couple shares a daughter, Kulture together and got married in a low-key wedding back in 2017.
