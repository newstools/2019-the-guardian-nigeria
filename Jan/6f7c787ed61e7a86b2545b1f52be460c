The winger, who has weighed in with nine goals and six assists to help fire Gladbach to third in the German league, would reportedly cost 42 million euros ($48.4m). The Belgium international has expressed interest in joining defending champions Bayern Munich or Dortmund — but only at the of the season. “At the moment, I can’t say much about other clubs, because I have spoken with (club) manager Max Eberl about focusing completely on Gladbach in the second half of the season,” said Hazard. Germany’s top-selling daily Bild reports that one of Dortmund’s lawyers is already in Argentina talking to 19-year-old Boca Juniors defender Balerdi, with his club president Daniel Angelici saying “the player wants to leave us”.
