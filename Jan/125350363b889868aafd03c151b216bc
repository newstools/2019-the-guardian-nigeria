With no plans of slowing down this New Year, Life Continental Lager Beer has continued its Bridge of Progress party with another edition in Asaba. The beer brand had ended the year 2018 in style, hosting consumers to three impressive year-end events. These included two Bridge of Progress parties and the Flavor of Africa concert. The Asaba edition which held at the Shoprite on Sunday, January 20, featured the Obiligbo Brothers, a highlife duo and fans favorite in the southeast, where they have become one of the most famous entertainers, and Afro-pop sensation, Harrysong Fresh off a hugely successful 2018, the brothers took to the stage full of confidence, and all in attendance were treated to the best of highlife music. Thanks to their brilliantly crafted melodies and wise use of Igbo proverbs.
