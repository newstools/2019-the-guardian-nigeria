Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari Friday announced the suspension of Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) Walter Onnoghen citing his “avowed respect” for the Rule of Law. The suspension, Buhari stated, is as a result of the six-count charge of non-declaration of assets. Although the CJN is being tried at the Code of Conduct Tribunal in Abuja, he is yet to make an appearance. Asides citing “grievous” allegations against Onnoghen, “the security agencies have since then traced other suspicious transactions running into millions of dollars to the CJN’s personal accounts, all undeclared or improperly declared as required by law.” “In line with this administration’s avowed respect for the Rule of Law, I have wholeheartedly obeyed the Order of the Code of Conduct Tribunal dated 23rd January 2019,” Buhari continued. Since then, several hashtags such as #TyrantBuhari, #Nigeria and the BuhariEffect have been trending on social media platform, Twitter. However, #TyrantBuhari shows to be trending worldwide while #Nigeria is trending in countries such as the Republic of Mauritius. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-843036 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tyrant-Buharii.png" alt="" width="1280" height="697" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tyrant-Buharii.png 788w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tyrant-Buharii-487x265.png 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tyrant-Buharii-320x174.png 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tyrant-Buharii-640x348.png 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tyrant-Buharii-600x327.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Nigerians including the President of the Nigeria Bar Association NBA, Paul Usoro, SAN have voiced their opinion on the suspension: VP Osinbajo said President Buhari was unaware of Walter Onnoghen trial, and I want to ask Osinbajo if the alleged “Reformed Democrat Buhari” is now aware that “General Buhari” has suspended the Chief Justice of Nigeria,Walter Onnoghen.#TheBuhariEffect #TyrantBuhari #Democracy — Simeon (@simmeonii) January 25, 2019  4. We call on the Federal Government to avert the looming constitutional crisis precipitated by its ill-advised action. In particular, the Nigerian Bar Association demands the reversal of the purported suspension of Honorable Mr. Justice Walter S C Onnoghen, GCON. — Paul Usoro, SAN. (@PaulUsoroSAN) January 25, 2019  “The CCT judge, Dan Ladi Umar, that recommended the suspension of the CJN also has a pending case of receiving a bribe of $1.8million with the EFCC. If Buhari did not suspend the CCT judge, why is he suspending the CJN??” #TyrantBuhari — Ibrahim’ PhD (@Mr_Emmcap__) January 25, 2019  “The price of freedom and sustenance of our democracy is eternal vigilance, and appropriate reaction to ward off iniquity” – Obasanjo.
If we are a serious nation ready for development, we must all resist the illegal suspension of CJN Onnoghen. #TyrantBuhari — Somto Onuchukwu (@chosensomto) January 25, 2019  #TyrantBuhari is not just an unrepentant tyrant, he is grossly irresponsible – he doesn’t take responsibility for his actions and on behalf of all sane and we’ll meaning Nigerians, WE reject this action by the irresponsible President we have! @UN @AlJazeera @cnni @BBCWorld @AP — Superstar Influencer (@LadiSpeaks) January 25, 2019  Things Fall Apart and the Center cannot Hold ~ Chinua Albert Achebe We’re back to 1983. #TyrantBuhari pic.twitter.com/d3CCFgeBwV — The Azodo (@SimplyAzodo) January 25, 2019  Now we have a full blown Hitler in charge of our country, acting as if he is law unto himself.
