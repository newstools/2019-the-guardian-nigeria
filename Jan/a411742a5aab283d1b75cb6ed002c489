Denis Suarez Arsenal are set to complete the signing of Barcelona midfielder Denis Suarez on loan. The deal had stalled over Barcelona’s insistence to insert a compulsory purchase clause but with reports claiming the Spanish midfielder will sign a contract extension at Barcelona, a loan deal to Arsenal could be completed. Suarez has struggled to make an impact at the Camp Nou, finding games hard to come by under Ernesto Valverde. He has made only eight appearances this season for Barcelona. The 25 year old will hope to find his spark working again with Unai Emery, his former coach at Sevilla. Arsenal also have hopes of signing Inter Milan winger Ivan Perisic before the transfer window closes. Suarez starred in Manchester City’s youth teams and made two League Cup appearances for City before he moved to Spain to join Barcelona B. He joined Sevilla on loan, then moved to Villarreal before a move to Barcelona. According to reports, Suarez pleaded with Barcelona to join Arsenal despite interest from Sevilla and Real Betis, who were keen on a permanent deal.
