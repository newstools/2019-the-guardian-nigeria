Royalty may just be four-years-old but she is already proving that she is a mini-me version of her music sensation father, Chris Brown. Royalty showed off her dance moves as she copied her dad’s music video for “Undecided”. Just like most of Brown’s music videos, “Undecided” is filled with amazing dance moves by him and in this case, he has the help of “Empire” star Serayah. In an adorable video, Royalty is seen showing her father love as she jammed along with it as if she was in the video herself. The video was shared by Royalty’s grandmother, Joyce Hawkins.

Joyce wrote in the caption “YASSSSS!!! SHE SAID AT THE END I DON’T WANT DADDY SCARED IM GONNA HOLD HIS HAND!!!! AWWWWW ROYALTY.” Watch the adorable video below:   YASSSSS!!!

AWWWWW ROYALTY A post shared by  Joyce Hawkins (@mombreezyofficial) on Jan 17, 2019 at 7:08pm PST  “Undecided” is the first single off Brown’s upcoming album “Indigo” and he thinks it’s one of his best musical efforts yet. It would be recalled he first teased the song on November 29, 2018 in an Instagram story. “No cap…This music I got cooking in the oven!!!! After the holidays we getting right to it!” he wrote. He continued, “I promise…never been one to brag, but I’m pushing myself harder and harder to make sure you feel it and it helps you internally.” The song samples Shanice‘s 1991 hit “I Love Your Smile.”
