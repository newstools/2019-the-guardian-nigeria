Bendel Insurance Bendel Insurance yesterday all but cemented their promotion to the Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) following their 1-0 defeat of Remo Stars in the day’s star match of the on-going Nigerian National League (NNL) Super Eight play-off. The competition is holding at the Enyimba Stadium, Aba. Playing in the Southern Zone, Insurance had on Monday beaten Delta Force 3-0 and now have six points from two games, which means that it would take a high score loss against 3SC today to stop their march to the elite class. Remo Stars still have the chance of qualifying as they have three points from their opening day 3-0 defeat of 3SC. They face whipping team, Delta Force, which lost 0-2 to 3SC yesterday, in their last match. A win will see them through ahead of 3SC, which can only gain promotion if they defeat Insurance by more than two goals and Delta Force beats Remo Stars today. In the Northern Zone, the coast seems clear for Kada City and Gombe United to march forward as they both have four points apiece to Real Stars and Kogi United’s one point each. Yesterday, Gombe United defeated Real Stars 1-0, while Kada City beat Kogi United 3-0. Gombe United and Kada City will qualify for the NPFL if their match today ends in a draw.
