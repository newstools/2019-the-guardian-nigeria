The February 16 election, which is contested by over 50 candidates will be preceded by a debate organised by the Broadcasting Organisation of Nigeria and Nigerian Elections Debate Group (NEDG). Buhari’s availability for the pre-election debate also has a special offer with the odds at 1.70 to attend and 1.45 not to attend. @NaijaBet Opens Betting option on President Buhari to attend NEDG/BON 2019 Presidential Debate on January 19, 2019.

Dezember 2018 Despite the president attending a town hall programme, where he answered questions from the moderator and the audience, there are major doubts about his appearance at the live debate. There has been no concrete commitment from the president to attend the debate scheduled for January 19, although Vice President Yemi Osinbajo was available for the vice presidential debate held in December by the same organisers. According to sources, there are fears over Buhari’s ability in a tense and high-paced debate against other candidates. There is no surprise Buhari spurned all debates in 2015 when he was contesting as a major opposition. Recently, Buhari declined a live interview with Arise TV, preferring a pre-recorded interview. This is not the first time that NaijaBet will offer odds on a non-sporting action. In August 2017, NaijaBet offered odds on the return of the President, who left Nigeria on a medical trip to London in May 2017.

August 2017  The betting company also offered betting opportunities to punters for the Lagos Governorship elections, with APC’s Babajide Sanwo-Olu and PDP’s Jimi Agbaje offered same odds (1.80) to win the election.
