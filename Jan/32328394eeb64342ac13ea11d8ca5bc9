A Nigerian female athlete Esther Edet has been expelled from the ongoing 19th Nigerian Colleges of Education Games (NICEGA) at the Federal College of Education, Obudu, Cross River State for not reciting the Nigeria national anthem. “All participants must obey the rules and play by them. Any athlete who goes contrary to the regulations of the Games will be shown the way out. And that is why I am expelling this participant for her attitude and disposition when the national anthem was playing,” NICEGA president, Sanusi Mohammed said after expelling Edet. Mohammed said such an attitude would not be permitted in a national sporting event. He noted that Edet’s expulsion from the competition “will serve as a deterrent to others to always obey the rules of the game.” The Provost, Federal College of Education, Obudu, James Ejue, urged the athletes to abide by the rules. “If you are a disciplined sportsman or woman, you must be a disciplined person who abhors violence, cheating, drug abuse and cultism. In this competition, there must be winners and losers,” Ejue said. Nigeria’s education minister Adamu Adamu, who was represented by the vice chancellor of the University of Calabar, Prof. Zana Akpagu, said sports have always served as a tool for national unity. “Sports from ancient times has always provided the right atmosphere through which people of all races, colours and tribes gather together to foster friendship, peace and unity as well as boost their economy because of the massive economic activities it generates,” Adamu said.
