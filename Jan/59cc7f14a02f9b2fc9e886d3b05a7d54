Suspected miscreants have raided and destroyed some equipment in the National Assembly office of the lawmaker representing Lagos Central Senatorial District and wife of All Progressives Congress (APC) national leader, Oluremi Tinubu. The miscreants burgled their way into Tinubu’s office in the morning, destroying various office equipment and went away with some. “Items removed included an HP laptop computer, Smile internet device, machine box attached to CCTV HP screen and some copies of Laws of the federation,” Oluremi Tinubu’s spokesperson Nifemi Aje said in a statement. Aje said the incident was discovered on Wednesday when the staff resumed work. Aje said the incident has been reported to the National Assembly police while they are waiting for the outcome of the investigation into the matter. “A report of the incident has already been lodged at the Police Post at the National Assembly and we are assured that the investigation has commenced into the matter.” Aje stated that the miscreants destroyed the CCTV and carted away some “critical items”. “Traces of footsteps were discovered on the office rug. The wall cabinet was left disorganised. Aje, however, said the identities of the persons could not be captured as the CCTV camera in the office had been destroyed. “We do not know those who perpetrated the burglary or those who sponsored them. We are, however, waiting for the outcome of the police investigation into the matter,” Aje said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
