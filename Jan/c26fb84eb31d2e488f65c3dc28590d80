Since manufacturing has not been performing well in the economy, investors’ confidence for all sectors affected has diminished.” For the Publicity Secretary of Independent Shareholders Association, Moses Igbrude, due to headwinds such as weak demand on the back of household wallets, most consumer goods companies in Nigerian have continued to find it difficult to weather the storm. He added that the operating environment is tensed and full of uncertainty of the general elections elicited caution on the part of investors. “ I think that is the main reason this is happening. Also, those foreign investors has moved their funds away from the market to safe environment until stability return after the elections. “ The Chairman, AG Leventis, Ahmed Kazalma Mantey, speaking at the group’s 59th Annual General Meeting (AGM), said: “The effect of the recession in our economy continued to impact adversely on our operations as there was a reduction in credit opportunities, which in turn affected our income.
