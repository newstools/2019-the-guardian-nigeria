The internet has been buzzing since news that “Thank U, Next” hitmaker, Ariana Grande is the headliner of 2019 Coachella. According to a report by TMZ, the real reason Grande was the best choice for the job was that organisers wanted to showcase female empowerment which they felt Grande matched. The decision was a bit tricky considering it involves women, empowerment and perseverance in the face of adversity but TMZ reports that organisers also felt Grande could match Beyonce who was last year’s headliner. Since the inception of the music festival, only three women have headlined it in the persons of Beyonce, Lady Gaga and Bjork. Putting into consideration that the award-winning Grande has been through hell recently but always managed to pick herself up and move forward, TMZ’s sources say everyone involved in the decision believes Grande will resonate especially with women. As one source put it, “Ariana is inspirational, and millions of people, particularly women, will connect with her.” This is right as Grande has an international audience, and the media and social media pickup the announcement has generated proves the point. It would be recalled that just in 2018, Grande was named as Billboard’s “Woman of the Year” and she also released a #1 album, “Sweetner”. In the same year, she lost her ex-boyfriend, Mac Mi,ller and called off her engagement to Pete Davidson.
