“Confident” hitmaker, Demi Lovato is thankful she survived 2018. It would be recalled she had a case of an overdose that nearly killed her. The singer in a social media post has said she will never take another day for granted again. She also used the post to reflect on 2018 by saying, “So grateful for the lessons I’ve learned this year. I will never take another day in life for granted, even the bad ones. Thankful for my fans, friends, family and everyone who supported me throughout this year. God bless.” It is noteworthy that although she didn’t mention the overdose specifically, many fans were able to deduce that Lovato is clearly referring to the almost fatal overdose she had back in July. We reported how Lovato had finished a night out with friends and returned to her Hollywood Hills home where she free-based what is rumoured to be likely oxy laced with fentanyl. Lovato’s friend and security guard found her and performed life saving measures. She was hospitalised in Los Angeles for several weeks before going to rehab for several months. The singer returned to Los Angeles in November and appears happy and healthy even celebrating Christmas with her family last week.
