The mother of one made this known while speaking with Van Lathan on “The Red Pill” podcast yesterday, January 15th. She disclosed that she once tried to sell drugs before finally becoming a stripper. In her words; “Stripping wasn’t my first option. You know, I tried selling drugs. I tried selling crack in my neighbourhood. And they (drug dealers) were like, ‘No,’” Rose revealed. “They said I was gonna get robbed, I was a girl, and I was too pretty, and it wasn’t going to happen. So what I did, I would bag it up for them. I would weigh it and bag up the crack rocks for them, and they would throw me some money.” Amber Rose on The Red Pill Podcast She continued saying; “I feel like rappers always get this pass of, like, ‘I had to sell drugs to feed my daughter. I had to sell drugs to feed my family.’ […] Like, ‘We made something out of nothing,” she explained. “And when it comes to me, it’s like, do I have to give you this story to understand? It’s been nine years since I’ve been famous, and I never told that to nobody […] Yeah, I was a stripper, and I did what the f**k I had to do to feed my family.” Watch her talk about the experience in the clip below:  In 2013, Rose married American rapper, Wiz Khalifa whom she shares a son, Sebastian with. The duo split in an amicable divorce a year and a half after the marriage. Their divorce was final on June 7, 2016.
