He will reunite with former Arsenal team-mate, Thierry Henry, and will be hoping to help the team avoid relegation as they sit in the 19th position. Fabregas’ departure from Chelsea sees him end four-and-a-half years at Stamford Bridge, helping them win two Premier League titles, the FA Cup and the League Cup. In total, he scored 22 goals and with 57 assists during his 198 appearances for Chelsea, the last of which came on Saturday when he bid an emotional farewell to the club’s fans in the final stages of his side’s 2-0 win over Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup.
