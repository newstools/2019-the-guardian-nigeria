We recently reported that rap star, Cardi B was locked down for Pepsi’s Super Bowl ad campaign. This is a major move for the mother of one as she joins a rarefied group of superstars, including Michael Jackson, Beyonce and Britney Spears to don Pepsi’s red, white and blue for the company’s Super Bowl ad campaign. The much-awaited advert has now been released. For this year Super Bowl ad campaign, Pepsi decided to title the ad, “Is Pepsi Ok?”. The advert features the “I Like It” rapper alongside Steve Carrell. The Pepsi spot is considered the premiere commercial during the big game, which is watched by hundreds of millions and has a long afterlife. Watch the new ad below,  It would be recalled that American supermodel and actress, Cindy Crawford did the honours last year, and her predecessors include music acts like Pink, One Direction, Madonna, Mariah Carey and The Spice Girls. It had been early speculated that Cardi B was in talks to join Maroon 5 during the halftime show but negotiations fell apart. It is safe to say that even though we won’t be seeing Cardi B perform on the Super Bowl stage this stage, the monumental Pepsi commercial has ensured that she is still a part of the epic TV moment. Just recently Cardi B slammed the president of the United States, Donald Trump for the partial government lockdown in the country.
