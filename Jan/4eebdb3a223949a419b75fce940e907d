 Gernot Rohr  Rohr has been criticised by many stakeholders for neglecting home-based players in the composition of his teams, but the Franco-German defence has always been that he cannot play serious games with players, who are not playing regularly in any competition. And now that the Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) has resumed after more than six months absence, the former Gabon manager says he would monitor the competition to fish out good players. Rohr was at the Agege Stadium on Wednesday to watch MFM FC defeat Enugu Rangers in the Week Four of the NPFL. Explaining his presence at the stadium, Rohr said, “I regret that the league had a long break after the last season, which affected the fitness of the players. But now that the league is on, I will watch out for the outstanding ones that can make the team. “The ones that are good among them will surely be invited to the team. The best of them will play the match. “We will invite the fittest players for the AFCON qualifiers against Seychelles and the friendly match against Egypt. “With the level at which some of the players are now in their different clubs, I believe they should turn that form to the national team.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
