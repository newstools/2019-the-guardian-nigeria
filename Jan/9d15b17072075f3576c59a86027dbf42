Apex Igbo socio-cultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo has told newly appointed chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commisson (INEC) committee on collation centre Amina Zakari to resign her role in the 2019 general election. “I call on Amina Zakari to honourably resign. Whatever happens to our democracy tomorrow, they (INEC and Federal Government) should hold themselves responsible,” President-general of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Nnia Nwodo said. INEC on Thursday, December 3 announced Zakari, who is speculated to be a niece to Nigeria president Muhammadu Buhari as collation officer for the election. Zakari appointment was met with the outrage of criticism which believes INEC was partisan – in favour of Buhari, who is seeking re-election under the All Progressives Congress (APC). However, Nwodo said Zakari’s appointment was one of many ways the Buhari government aims to cripple the nation’s democracy. He alleged that it was impossible for INEC and the federal government to ensure the 2019 general elections are free, fair and credible with a relative of the president serving in the capacity of collation officer. Nwodo said, “It’s like Rangers VS Kano Pillars and Kano Pillars is allowed to nominate a referee. It’s impossible for justice to be done. In a civilized clime, Amina Zakari should have resigned.” “I expected the APC government has come to power through a free and fair election conducted by another president, they should not destroy the history. Infrastructural upgrade tops sports ministry’s 2019 to do list.” “With continued membership of Mrs. Zakari in the commission, the corporate personality of INEC is seriously whittled down; making her head of collation committee is worse than anything anybody can imagine,” Nwodo said.
