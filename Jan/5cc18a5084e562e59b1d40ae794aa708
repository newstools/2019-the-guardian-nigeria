• Says APC Will Win Kaduna, Kano, Gombe, Jigawa And Nasarawa
The leader of the Inri Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Ayodele Elijah Babatunde, has predicted that President Muhammadu Buhari would be the last president on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Primate Ayodele also warned: “If Buhari wins a second time, he may not have the energy to handle governance, as his ill-health will still affect his performance. The President needs a lot of prayers for his health.” Ayodele, who made the predictions in a statement made available to newsmen in Ado Ekiti, yesterday, said APC would win Kaduna, Kano, Gombe Jigawa, and Nasarawa, but would lose in Niger and Adamawa. The poll in Oyo was predicted to be between African Democratic Congress (ADC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He said: “There will be serious crisis between Oshiomole and Buhari’s loyalists. Oshiomole will have problems after the presidential polls. Governor Amosun should not underestimate Dapo Abiodun as he will shake the state. Dapo Abiodun should also beware of Amosun’s candaidate. Akpabio is so desirous of winning Akwa Ibom for the presidency. PDP should note this and work harder. “Governor Wike will not have it easy winning a second time. Two governors will betray Atiku in his ambition. Emmanuel Udom must also strategise if he wants to win. If APC is not very careful, they will lose in Zamfara and polls will not hold in all states. “APC must work very hard in Edo or else PDP will upstage it. PDP will win in Kwara, and Governor el-Rufai will find it very hard clinching a second term. “Jigawa, Gombe, Adamawa, Ogun, Ekiti, Ondo, Akwa Ibom and Rivers will be war zones in the coming polls. Governor Akeredolu should be prayerful, so he won’t face daunting challenges. Not all the governors will complete their time.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
