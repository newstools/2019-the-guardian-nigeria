Pablo Escobar’s brother, Roberto (El Osito) Escobar, recently launched a GoFundMe page which has been taken down at this time, to impeach Donald Trump. The total amount asked to be raised was $50 million USD, with no indication as to how the money would be used. Roberto Escobar, did however, tell Global News that the amount of $50 million USD was because “it costs money to go against a powerful guy like Trump.” According to sources close to Roberto Escobar, the “ByeByeTrump” campaign on GoFundMe raised just over $10 million USD ($10,786,980 USD to be exact) in the 10 hours it was live. Short of the $50 million USD goal, the campaign was stopped by GoFundMe for an investigation as to where and what the funds would be going towards. While the GoFundMe page is down, his main webpage for impeaching Trump is still active. All that’s left from the GoFundMe page can be seen in the screenshot below, where it reads “We, the people will impeach Donald Trump with Pablo Escobar’s family holding dirty secrets of President Trump, his family and associates.”
