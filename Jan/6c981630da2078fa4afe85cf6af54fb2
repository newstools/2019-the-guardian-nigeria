The former president of the United States, Barack Obama has made a debut on Billboard Hot RnB chart. The debut is thanks to his performance alongside Christopher Jackson and BeBe Winans on a track from  the Broadway musical “Hamilton,” called “One Last Time.”  Obama on the track recites a passage from George Washington’s 1796 farewell address at the end of the song. The gospel track is reported by The Hollywood Reporter to have sold 9,000 downloads and had 307,000 online streams in the first week following its December 20, 2018 release. The song was released by the Broadway musical’s creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, in the accompany of a series of “Hamildrops–” songs intended to raise money for various nonprofits. It would be recalled that Obama who is the 44th president of the United State has appeared on two now-defunct Billboard charts. “A Moment in History: The Inauguration of Barack Obama” which hit number six on the TV DVD Sales tally in March 2009, while a song, “Pop Off,” by JX Cannon featuring Obama, reached No. 10 on Billboard + Twitter Emerging Artists in December 2015. An instant pop-culture behemoth, Hamilton nabbed a record 16 Tony nominations and 11 wins in 2016. The musical is a take on the life of American founding father Alexander Hamilton. Just recently Obama listed his favourite books, songs and film of 2018.
