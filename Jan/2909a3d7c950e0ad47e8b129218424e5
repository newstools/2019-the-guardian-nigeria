 Dr. Leo Stan Ekeh, Chairman of Zinox Group,  “You must anticipate the future. It is not static, otherwise you don’t have a reason to grow. The 21st Century is a knowledge century; it is one in which you have a right to be rich, even as an employee because if they under-pay you, you have a chance to get a better job,” Ekeh declared. “If you are an entrepreneur, then you have a right to make mega-wealth. A lot of you are intimidated when you look at the profile of people like the Aliko Dangotes and Mike Adenugas but you forget that when a man is successful, you only hear the good side of their emergence but if you look back critically, you will see that their rise to the top was not an easy one. When you are psychologically defeated, you have lost the war. Ekeh who recently oversaw the acquisition of e-commerce giants, Konga from previous owners Naspers and AB Kinnevik followed by a combination of its operations with that of Yudala, declared his chosen field of technology as a leveler and the only profession in the world that can bridge the gap between the rich and the poor individuals and countries of the world. “Technology is the only way the son of a poor man can become rich in the 21st Century and that is the only way the son of a rich man can consolidate the wealth of the family. You are a stupid, poor man if you cannot challenge the status quo. It was through technology that I transformed the media and multimedia industry and computerized them for the first time. “Same way we helped create a reliable database of voters for Nigeria through the impressive work Zinox has done with INEC and which we have replicated in other African countries such as Guinea-Bissau. Today, we are currently looking to transit the country to e-Voting which will further go a long way in reducing post-election litigations,” he enthused.
