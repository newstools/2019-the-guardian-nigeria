The 21-year-old will miss both legs of Barca’s Copa del Rey quarter-final with Champions League-chasing Sevilla after picking up the injury during his side’s 3-1 home win over Leganes on Sunday, which maintained the Catalans’ five-point lead at the top of La Liga. France international Dembele opened the scoring in the 32nd minute of his 50th Barca appearance with his 13th goal of the season. He will also be unavailable for La Liga clashes with Girona and Valencia. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
