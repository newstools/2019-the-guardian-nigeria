If you are waiting for Mariah Carey to hop on the #10YearsChallenge, you may have to wait a little while longer because she is not here for it. The music diva made a hilarious point about the #10YearsChallenge in an Instagram post and understandably so. The #10YearsChalenge requires social media users to share before and after photos from 2009 and 2018 but Carey who has been serving consistent good looks isn’t about to post any “glow-up” or “glow-down” photos. According to her, she’s not even keeping track of time. She wrote, “I don’t get this 10 year challenge, time is not something I acknowledge. ,” she posted to Instagram on January 16, along with a “before and after”…of the same picture. “*Picture taken at some point prior to today.” Interestingly, Carey is not the only one to have poked some fun with the “10-Year Challenge,” which started with a Facebook meme that went viral in January 2019. Stars like Jennifer Lopez and Chrissy Teigen have also had some fun with it. On the local scene, many Nigerian celebrities like Toke Makinwa, AY Makun, Adesua Etomi, Don Jazzy, Linda Ejiofor, Paul Okoye, Falz, Tonto Dikeh, Iyabo Ojo among others.
