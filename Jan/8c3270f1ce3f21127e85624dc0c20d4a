It appears J. Cole would be releasing new music very soon as he took to social media, after wiping his Instagram page clean, to notify fans he will be dropping a new single titled “Middle Child” on Jan. 23. It also looks like T-Minus, the producer who worked on the KOD track “Kevin’s Heart” alongside Mark Pelli, made the beat for the upcoming single. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-839960 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/J-Cole-single-release-tweet.jpg" alt="" width="1242" height="1616" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/J-Cole-single-release-tweet.jpg 1242w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/J-Cole-single-release-tweet-460x598.jpg 460w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/J-Cole-single-release-tweet-885x1152.jpg 885w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/J-Cole-single-release-tweet-428x557.jpg 428w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/J-Cole-single-release-tweet-856x1114.jpg 856w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/J-Cole-single-release-tweet-184x240.jpg 184w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/J-Cole-single-release-tweet-369x480.jpg 369w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/J-Cole-single-release-tweet-461x600.jpg 461w" sizes="(max-width: 1242px) 100vw, 1242px" /> As previously mentioned, the announcement of “Middle Child” comes just hours after Cole’s IG page went dark and this prompted fans to speculate that new music was on the way from the North Carolina rapper. It looks like those speculations were correct. It’s still unclear if the song will land on an upcoming album or if it will be a standalone.
