Wearing glasses or sunglasses are more than just a fashion or sunny weather accessory, they can either make or mar an otherwise stylish look. Although it may seem like bad news, you know that no matter how symmetrical your face is, not every pair of sunglasses will look great on you. These tips below offer insight on how to select sunglasses to match your face shape. If you have a round face, you have a broader forehead, full cheeks and rounded jawline than most. To get a defined look, glasses with square and rectangular-framed should be your pick. In addition, glasses that visually lengthen your face are what you should look at to draw attention from around your jawline, so choose glasses with dark frames. They help narrow your face and add contour to give it an oval shape.
To balance your facial proportions, choose a frame where the width is greater than the height. The oval face shape is versatile and can get away with all kinds of sunglasses as the shape is well proportionate. People with an oval face have a chin that is slightly narrower than the forehead. Opt for wayfarer style sunglasses as the angular shape adds balance to a curvy face. Your goal is to not disturb your face’s harmonious proportions so avoid massive glasses and preferably go for sunglasses that have a frame as wide as your face or a little wider. Ensure the frame’s upper part is in line with your eyebrows. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-845415 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Writer-and-model-Devin-Norelle-wearing-glasses-with-mirror-cat-eye-frames-for-square-face-shapes-Photo-Allure-Magazine.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1280" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Writer-and-model-Devin-Norelle-wearing-glasses-with-mirror-cat-eye-frames-for-square-face-shapes-Photo-Allure-Magazine.jpg 800w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Writer-and-model-Devin-Norelle-wearing-glasses-with-mirror-cat-eye-frames-for-square-face-shapes-Photo-Allure-Magazine-598x598.jpg 598w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Writer-and-model-Devin-Norelle-wearing-glasses-with-mirror-cat-eye-frames-for-square-face-shapes-Photo-Allure-Magazine-100x100.jpg 100w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Writer-and-model-Devin-Norelle-wearing-glasses-with-mirror-cat-eye-frames-for-square-face-shapes-Photo-Allure-Magazine-200x200.jpg 200w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Writer-and-model-Devin-Norelle-wearing-glasses-with-mirror-cat-eye-frames-for-square-face-shapes-Photo-Allure-Magazine-487x487.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Writer-and-model-Devin-Norelle-wearing-glasses-with-mirror-cat-eye-frames-for-square-face-shapes-Photo-Allure-Magazine-240x240.jpg 240w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Writer-and-model-Devin-Norelle-wearing-glasses-with-mirror-cat-eye-frames-for-square-face-shapes-Photo-Allure-Magazine-480x480.jpg 480w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Writer-and-model-Devin-Norelle-wearing-glasses-with-mirror-cat-eye-frames-for-square-face-shapes-Photo-Allure-Magazine-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> You can add curves to your sharp face with round and oval frames like “Aviator Sunglasses” and “Butterfly Sunglasses”. Rounded frames will help to visually balance and soften overall facial proportions. Sharp-angled rectangular or square frames can “overload” your face’s outlines. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-845414 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kerry-Washington-in-glasses-suitable-for-heart-shaped-faces-Photo-Pinterest.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="2250" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kerry-Washington-in-glasses-suitable-for-heart-shaped-faces-Photo-Pinterest.jpg 1500w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kerry-Washington-in-glasses-suitable-for-heart-shaped-faces-Photo-Pinterest-399x598.jpg 399w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kerry-Washington-in-glasses-suitable-for-heart-shaped-faces-Photo-Pinterest-768x1152.jpg 768w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kerry-Washington-in-glasses-suitable-for-heart-shaped-faces-Photo-Pinterest-371x557.jpg 371w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kerry-Washington-in-glasses-suitable-for-heart-shaped-faces-Photo-Pinterest-743x1114.jpg 743w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kerry-Washington-in-glasses-suitable-for-heart-shaped-faces-Photo-Pinterest-160x240.jpg 160w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kerry-Washington-in-glasses-suitable-for-heart-shaped-faces-Photo-Pinterest-320x480.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kerry-Washington-in-glasses-suitable-for-heart-shaped-faces-Photo-Pinterest-400x600.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /> People with heart-shaped faces have wider foreheads than their cheekbones and jawlines with a pointed chin. In choosing suitable sunglasses, your goal is to balance out the upper part of your face by making the lower part appear bulkier.
Avoid massive-looking sunglasses, as they will add more bulk to the upper part. Instead, go for something light and thin with rounded edges to balance your sharp chin. Also, sunglasses, where the width equals the width of your face, works like a teardrop-shaped design, (wire-rim aviators work best for you). People with diamond-shaped faces have a pointed chin with smaller jawlines than their cheekbones. If you have a diamond-faced shape, go for sunglasses with frames that widen your face and compliment your wide cheekbones. Sunglasses with wrap-around styles are your best picks. Just like the oval face shape but with an angular jawline, you should be looking at offsetting your face’s sharp angles with thin or translucent frames with oval or rounded edges.
