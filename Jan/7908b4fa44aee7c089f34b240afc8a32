She is the only Nigerian and the second Africa in the list. The list features women from science, social justice, law, politics and other industries. According to Instyle, the women “consistently show up, speak up, and get the job done.” Portrait of Tolulope Lewis-tamoka<br />taken at UN Women Headquarters on 18 October, 2017.<br />Photo: UN Women/Ryan Brown In the list, Tolulope is praised for her contribution with the following words: The Africa program adviser for U.N. Women was instrumental in developing Nia, the first female character from Africa on the animated children’s series Thomas & Friends. “[Nia] will push a new understanding of diversity, universality, and gender equality, which is important for future global citizens,” she says. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-837203 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Thomas-and-Friends.jpg" alt="" width="1230" height="603" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Thomas-and-Friends.jpg 1230w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Thomas-and-Friends-1062x521.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Thomas-and-Friends-487x239.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Thomas-and-Friends-974x477.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Thomas-and-Friends-320x157.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Thomas-and-Friends-640x314.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Thomas-and-Friends-600x294.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1230px) 100vw, 1230px" /> See the full list here.
