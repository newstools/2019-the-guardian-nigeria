We have all been expecting new music from rapper The Game but we weren’t expecting for him to drop a bombshell because this is exactly what his new song which was just teased is! The rapper name dropped reality TV star and mother of three Kim Kardashian in a preview of his new track and we are sure her husband, Kanye West is not going to be pleased. The rapper who previewed a few of his new tracks yesterday, January 24 had everyone raving when one, in particular, stood out. The said song paints a graphic picture of the rapper having sex with Kardashian as he raps, “I held Kim Kardashian by her throat ni**a/I made her swallow my kids until she choked ni**a/I should apologize, ’cause ‘Ye my folks ni**a/This for all my Vicelords and locs, ni**a.” The video of the track preview appears to have come from the Instagram handle @shalynda_jai_, who serves as the assistant to singer and record producer Eric Bellinger. In the video, dozens of other people can be seen in the room as they jam to the track.
