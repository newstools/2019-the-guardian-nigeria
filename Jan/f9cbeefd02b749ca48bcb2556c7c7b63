He noted said that the ministry had earlier summoned the tricyclists association over the act, yet the tricyclists still failed to comply with the exercise and continue to operate just like any other day. “We are issuing them with final warning and if they continue their act, we will have no option but to begin prosecuting them.” Makoda appealed to residents to adopt and sustain sanitation not only on monthly basis, but a part of their daily routine. The commissioner further appealed to National Union of Road and Transport Workers (NURTW) to warn commercial drivers coming into Kano on sanitation days.
