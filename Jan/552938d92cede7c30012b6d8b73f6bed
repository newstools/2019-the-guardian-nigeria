After London Fashion Week Men’s Pitti Uomo Autumn/Winter 2019 and Milan Fashion Week, Paris Fashion Week Men’s AW19 is well underway and it has brought out a barrage of style and colour on and off the runway. Our focus right now is on the daring looks and outlandish outfits from the streets of Paris. Braving the cold weather, attendees showed off their layering prowess with bright patterns and outlandish accessorizing. Virgil Abloh‘s Off-White™ label stood out as a favorite followed by notable pieces from Heron Preston and some unearthed grails from Raf Simons. Notable figures found in our roundup include Skepta, Naomi Campbell, Kid Cudi, Offset and many more.
