Get into the new year fit! Staying fit is not just good for health but also for your body image perception. Below are easy steps to draw up your fitness plan for 2019:  To draw up a plan you need to have a goal to align your projections. Don’t set unrealistic goals as it will indirectly affect your motivation.  Write down exactly the time you will be exercising, fitness goals, exercises for each fitness goal and how you will measure success in 2019.  When drawing up your fitness plan, it is of utmost importance to let your doctor see it especially if you are currently on medication or managing an illness.

The big question is which exercise is needed for you to achieve your fitness goal. For butt try the step up and squats,  for the bicep and triceps muscles try the bench press or push-ups, for abs try the sit-ups, plank or other exercises.

In the end, your fitness plan must be fluid enough to gel into your regular day.  Stick up your 2019 plan in a place that will visit in your house daily. You can place it on your freezer, makeup mirror, the front of your closet door or even your bathroom door.
