For singer, Harrison Tare Okiri, well known as Harrysong or Mr. Songz, “making peace with yourself begins with your ability to face your truth.” This was his statement as finally made peace with his former label mate, Kcee and boss, E-money, at his album listening party. According to him he had to make peace because “it begins your ability to face your truth and you can never bite a finger that fed you my people…let love lead.” With peace accord, the Reggae Blues crooner put the past in its place and reunites with his former team after months of malice. “I had a great time at my listening party and it gave me time to reflect as I watched my young bro Skiibii perform his hit song Sensima. My journey will never be complete without Kcee and E-money; you were part of the vessels that God used to change my story. I appreciate you both, I was hurt and reacted at the time but regardless of what happened, I recognise the impact you made in my life.”

They all danced and savoured every minute of their stay inside the Dome Event centre, on Okpanam road. The show, according to Harrysong, was aimed at preaching peace in the region following the activities of the Niger Delta Avengers, which have ravaged the area for months. True to him, there was never a dull moment as all the acts that performed at the event, which lasted for more than eight hours, came with the same mindset.
