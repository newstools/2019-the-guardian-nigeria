Some few days ago, rap star, Cardi B teamed up with City Girls, Yung Miami and JT,  to start a “Twerk Challenge”, which hit streets across the globe. The challenge is for the visual of “Twerk” that has Cardi B as a guest artist. The controversial video shows the women aboard a yacht in a twerk competition with body paint. The release of the video has since been met with mixed reactions and one of those to criticise the video is news anchor, Stephanie Hamill who believes it objectifies women. According to Hamill, the video that sees a lot of women twerking in their bikinis is a let down on women, especially in this #MeToo era. Taking to Twitter, she wrote, “In the Era of #meToo how exactly does this empower women? Leftists, @iamcardib , feel free to chime in. THX ..” Cardi B who has always been a vocal artist was quick to jump on the backlash she received for the video. The mother of one responded by slamming conservatives when she tweeted, “It says to women that I can wear and not wear what ever I want. do w.e I want and that NO still means NO. So Stephanie chime in..If I twerk and be half naked does that mean I deserve to get raped and molested ? I want to know what a conservative woman like you thinks” “All these conservatives been harassing me and telling me the most disgusting things these past few days.Listen I’m not telling ya to turn liberal all I’m saying is to admit that your president is fu*kin up this country right now! Liberal or conservative we ALL suffer as citizens.” Cardi B and City Girls Hamill then responded in agreement that no means no, no matter what while still expressing worries about the video which she says objectifies women. “I agree, No means NO, NO MATTER what!
But this video, & others like this sexually objectify women. I think this hurts all women & the cause. We’re not sex OBJECTS! Clearly we see things differently, (maybe I’m just a hater bc I can’t Twerk ) Come on my show, debate me!” Watch the controversial video below:
