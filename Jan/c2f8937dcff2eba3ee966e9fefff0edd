 Babatunde Raji Fashola, Minister of Works, Power and Housing.  He said the businesses would be concentrated mainly in the metering segment of the industry, which he noted was currently challenged. Fashola said this yesterday at Alaka area of Lagos, where he addressed residents in a town hall meeting. According to him, 108 firms have registered with government to take over electricity metering supply to customers and ensure that Nigerians are adequately metered. More developmental projects initiated by the government would be pursued to logical conclusion given their importance, he said, adding that Nigerians should endeavour to pursue the same aspiration by ensuring continuity.He said: “Most of the difficulties we are facing today are products of our past decisions. But the government remains committed to prospering the common man. “The path to prosperity is tough; but those who persevere will benefit.”Fashola said the electricity distribution companies (DisCos) would be introducing the new metering companies to customers on their networks. For him, the development would create more jobs for Nigerians and further ensure accountability in the power sector, especially at the distribution end.On another vein, the minister expressed optimism that petroleum products would be distributed through the railway when the rail projects were completed, as against the use of tankers. He also intimated the residents of a new power substation at Ijora area Lagos, which will ensure uninterrupted supply.The minister stressed: “Infrastructure development is key to ending youth unemployment. Government can only do the little it can to employ citizens, but the private sector will do more leveraging on available infrastructure.”He urged Nigerians to give the government the opportunity to do more, describing the coming polls as an opportunity to realise the aspiration.
