Outspoken rapper and producer Kanye West has reportedly declared his intention to sue EMI Publishing, UMG Recordings, Bravado International Group, and JAY-Z’s imprint Roc-a-Fella Records. According to The Hollywood Reporter, ‘West filed lawsuits against the companies Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court. The legal documents are said to be heavily redacted, but it appears the dispute is over unpaid royalties and publishing rights. UMG, Bravado, and Roc-a-Fella are listed as co-defendants in one suit. EMI, which began handing the rights to Kanye’s songs in 2003, is listed in a separate complaint. The latter suit states Kanye had inked a deal with the publishing company shortly before he released his debut album, College Dropout. According to TMZ, the rapper claims that by the end of 2011, he had written more than 200 records that were given to EMI. Though specific tracks aren’t mentioned, the outlet reports the records “include some of the most influential and successful songs in his catalog.” “There now exists a dispute between Plaintiffs and Defendant EMI regarding the parties’ rights and obligations to one another under the EMI Contract and Extensions,” the EMI lawsuit reads, as reported by THR. The artiste is being represented by high-powered legal firm Quinn Emanuel litigator Robert Schwartz. He is seeking a transfer of property and declaratory relief. He is also alleging unjust enrichment on the plaintiffs’ part.
