Orilade said if both men failed to disclose useful information, they may not be released on time. Fani-Kayode Tuesday tweeted: “Why have the EFCC surrounded the home of CJN Onnoghen and why are they seeking to arrest him? These people want Nigeria to burn! Buhari call off your dogs before it is too late! This is a democracy and not a gestapo state! In the name of God let this madness stop.” He has since deleted the tweet. Also, Odumakin, an Afenifere chieftain, also posted a video saying he had learnt of the EFCC’ move against the top jurist. In the video which is just over a minute, Odumakin claimed: “men of the EFCC are currently at the gate of the CJN to effect his arrest, despite the fact that the matter in issue with the CJN is already in court.” However, in a statement by Orilade on Tuesday the anti-graft agency denied any alleged plan to arrest Onnoghen stating it is “not only a figment of the imagination of the purveyor of the fake news but an evil machination by the creator and carriers of the news aimed at creating anarchy in the country.” Onnoghen, who is facing allegations of false asset filings with the Code of Conduct Bureau, has also denied the claim.
