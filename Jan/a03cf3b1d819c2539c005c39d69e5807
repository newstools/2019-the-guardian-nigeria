Lionel Richie’s son, Miles Richie, was arrested after throwing a tantrum at the Heathrow airport in the UK after threatening to detonate a bomb and punching a security guard, celebrity paparazzi site TMZ reports. Witnesses claim that the 24-year-old model threat came after he was denied entry to a flight on Saturday. According to the report by the Police at Scotland Yard, he “claimed he had a bomb in his bag, which he’d detonate if he wasn’t let on to the plane.” “On Saturday, January 19, a 24-year-old man accepted a caution for communicating false information causing a bomb hoax and battery following an incident at Heathrow Terminal 5 earlier that morning.” But this was thrown out after he accepted caution which also translates to him avoiding prosecution.
