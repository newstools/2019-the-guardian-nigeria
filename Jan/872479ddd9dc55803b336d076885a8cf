 Master card  CQM is a separate Mastercard programme that assesses card production quality and compliments the site security compliance managed by the Global Vendor Certification Programme (GVCP). CQM is mandatory for vendors that manufacture or personalise chip cards, and promotes high quality, reliability and compliance with Mastercard card standards. The objective of the CQM scheme is to ensure that the quality of card products sold under the Mastercard brand is properly managed by vendors; hence CQM requires compliance with ISO 9001:2015 standards. However, CQM defines requirements beyond ISO 9001, partially due to the fact that ISO is by definition a generic standard and CQM is more precise, as it has a much tighter and better defined perimeter.
 
The employed processes for qualification are predicated on two Quality Requirements – Product Quality Requirements, and Quality Assurance Requirements. CQM mandates that quality control measures in product qualification, production quality control and quality monitoring are achieved.
