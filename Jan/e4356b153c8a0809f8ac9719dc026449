A High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in Maitama, Abuja has granted bail to Nigerian lawmaker Senator Dino Melaye, who was being held in a police health facility in Abuja. Dino Melaye’s lawyer, Mike Ozekhome (SAN), was granted a bail application by Justice Yusuf Halilu on health grounds. Justice Halilu was of the view the Senator must be healthy to stand trial. He said since the Senator cannot be arraigned on the stretcher or ‎on his hospital bed, he should be allowed on bail to attend to his health. The judge asked him to produce three sureties, one of who must be the clerk of the National Assembly, who must undertake to produce him when he is to be arraigned in respect of a charge already filed against him. The judge said the other two sureties must be owners of properties within the Abuja metropolis. Melaye was arrested by the Police after a siege on his home in Maitama, Abuja on Friday, January 4. The Senator locked away in his apartment, surrendered on the eighth day of the siege. He slumped while he was being taken into custody and was taken to the police infirmary in Garki. The People’s Democratic Party lawmaker was arrested for alleged criminal conspiracy and attempted culpable homicide. Melaye is currently standing trial in more than one suit. He has been accused of illegal possession of arms, gun running and sponsoring hoodlums in Kogi State. Police spokesman Jimoh Moshood said the shooting and injuries on a police officer by Senator Dino Melaye and his armed thugs in Kogi State on the 19th July 2018 warranted his arrest. He added that the police officer was yet to recover from the gunshot injury he sustained during the attack and was under intensive medical care. “The Police Officer, Sgt. Danjuma Saliu, is yet to recover from the gunshot injury he sustained during the attack and still under intensive medical care in the hospital.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
