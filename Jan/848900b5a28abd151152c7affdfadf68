Nigeria Police has denied allegations that it plans to break into the Abuja residence of Nigeria lawmaker, Dino Melaye. Melaye, who represents Kogi South Senatorial district in the Nigerian Senate had alleged that Police officers brought tools to break into and vandalize his house. “Police bringing in toolboxes to break doors and vandalize my house. Police EOD truck just brought them,” Dino Melaye tweeted. The Police, however, denied the allegations on Wednesday, while also taking journalists around the house as proof. It also deployed additional officers to secure the arrest of the senator while cordoning off his home on Sangha Street in Maitama, Abuja. The siege on his home has entered its sixth day. A team of policemen stormed the senator’s residence on Friday, December 29 to arrest him over allegations of “criminal conspiracy and attempted culpable homicide, committed on 19th July, 2018.” Melaye, who claimed he was out of Abuja, told the police to secure the country, rather than run after him, saying he is not a criminal as alleged by the Police. The police claimed they heard him shout at an officer from a window on the building’s top floor and vowed to remain at the residence until he surrenders to be arrested.
