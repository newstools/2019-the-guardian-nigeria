IPOB The Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) has debunked a report that it planned to kidnap South-East governors. IPOB’s spokesman, Emma Powerful, in a statement issued to newsmen in Awka, Anambra State yesterday, denied any knowledge of such a plot, which he described as a ploy by the governors to score cheap popularity and curry sympathy from the electorate. He further described the allegation as a campaign of calumny being perpetrated by the South-East governors, urging members of the public to disregard such insinuations. He said: “The leadership and family members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) condemn, in its entirety, the frivolous, unsubstantiated and perverse statement from Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State against a movement like IPOB. It appears anytime a quisling wants to renew his slave status with his northern masters; he or she singles out IPOB for verbal assault. We consider the statement credited to Umahi as symptomatic of the shameful and complicity role these Igbo governors have continued to play. “Their stock in trade is treachery and betrayal but unfortunately for them, we IPOB will match them every step of the way until their conniving treacherous scheme is brought to an end. “Isn’t it sad that Dave Umahi and his fellow quislings never foresaw Fulani herdsmen invasion of our land but are quick to invite the army to occupy our and kill us Biafrans as usual. “Fulani slaves parading themselves as Igbo governors have perfected plan to use soldiers deployed to the South-East to abduct, arrest and preferably kill top IPOB leaders in Biafraland or anybody suspected to be IPOB member because of IPOB’s resolve to boycott next month’s presidential election.
