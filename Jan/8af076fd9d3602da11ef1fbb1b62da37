Embattled music artiste, is no longer ready to entertain the accusations from his many accusers. This time, he has threatened to sue Lifetime if they go ahead to air a documentary tagged “Surviving R.Kelly” on his sexual activities. According to TMZ, the documentary shows him as a “sexual-crazed and abusive cult-leader.” The documentary will see family, friends come forward with allegations that he has done more than sexually abusing his victims. His lawyer, Brain Nix, has said that they will go ahead with a federal lawsuit if it airs today. This is because, he says that the people coming forward are doing it to become famous via their involvement in the case. Recall that his brother Carey Kelly, in September 2018, had accused him of impregnating his 14-year-old cousin in a diss track an allegation he did not refute. In a recent development, a family of one of his “victims”, Joycelyn Savage, is seeking that she returns because he may have kidnapped her, a claim she denied.
