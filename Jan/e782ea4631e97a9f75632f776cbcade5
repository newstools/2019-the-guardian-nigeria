Its been a very active weekend on Twitter as users have been both amused and disgusted with the exploits of one Michael Asiwaju popularly known as Mike Cash who was recently outed as a serial rapist and an abuser by one of his alleged victims. Asiwaju is alleged to have raped numerous women, some in his car, some in hotel rooms. A Twitter user earlier alleged that she got information that a certain Twitter user rapes women then threatens them into silence. She then said she couldn’t say more until she gets proof. Later, she returned to reveal that she has proof and went ahead to release the name of the man. She also released screenshots of the message she allegedly got from one of the man’s alleged victims. In the screenshots, the alleged victim narrated how Michael Asiwaju, raped her. She also shared screenshots of a conversation between the lady and the guy which allegedly ensued after the alleged rape. The screenshots below detail the allegations. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-833336 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1931"

surrounding the whole saga thickened as Twitter users dug up old news article where he was arrested for blackmail and rape. It has also been alleged that his mother has been dead for a long time and not hours ago as he claims. Replying to the allegations, Mike said he spent half a Million Naira on drinks for the women then had sex with them when he was high. He, however, didn’t state if they consented to the sex. He also released nude photos which he claimed women sent to him via his DM. But Twitter users pointed out that the women who sent him nudes aren’t the same ones accusing him of rape, therefore, his explanation isn’t valid. Mike Cash later claimed his mother died on Saturday, Jan 12,  after reading the rape accusations against him. He also threatened to commit suicide. But someone who claims to know Mike Cash and his family has said that his mother and father have been long dead. As the matter intensified on Twitter with more and more people accusing Mike and citing flaws in his replies, Twitter users found an old news report where it was reported that Mike was arrested for blackmail and rape. The 2017 report by Premium Times said Mike accused police of extorting him but it was later revealed that Mike was actually arrested by the police after he was accused of rape and blackmail by a female student of the University of Ilorin. Mike was also accused of trying to bribe his way out of the rape case. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-833329 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tweet-3.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1840" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tweet-3.jpg 720w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tweet-3-416x598.jpg 416w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tweet-3-387x557.jpg 387w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tweet-3-167x240.jpg 167w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tweet-3-334x480.jpg 334w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tweet-3-417x600.jpg 417w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Asiwaju has since gone private on Twitter and isn’t responding to new allegations levelled against him.
