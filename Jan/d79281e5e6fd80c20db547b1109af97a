Nigeria is the most populated country in Africa and has become an untapped tourist paradise with long stretches of exotic beaches, lush mountains, well-preserved tradition and culture and enchanting attractions that draw tourists from different parts of the world. In recent times, we have witnessed a spike in the number of tourists coming to see the sights of the most populated black nation and these tourists often end up seeing just a fraction of what the whole country has to offer. For this reason, here is a list of five top attractions in Nigeria: 1. Obudu Mountain Resort: Obudu Mountain Resort (formerly known as Obudu cattle ranch) is a ranch and resort on the Obudu Plateau in Cross River State. Its breathtaking views, tranquillity and beautiful scenery have made this resort one of the most famous touristsâ€™ destinations in Nigeria. Obudu Mountain Resort. Photo: Adedotun Ajibade. 2.
