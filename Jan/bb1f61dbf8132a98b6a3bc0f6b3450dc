No one likes to have puffy eyes or eye bags because no matter how much makeup you put on to conceal it, it would find a way to show itself to the world. Of course, apart from crying, puffy eyes can be caused by stress, lack of sleep and allergic reactions and with the amount of stress most of us go through everyday, work, traffic, waking up early and so on, it is hard to escape puffy eyes
So what can to do? Before throwing thousands of Naira on expensive creams, here are some home remedies you can try. Cold Compress
The easiest of all as all you need is a clean washcloth. Dip the washcloth in cool water and apply the wet cloth on the swollen area gently. Do this gradually and in a few moments, the swelling would reduce. Tea Bags
Tea bags can also work for puffy eyes. Black tea bags have caffeine while green tea have chamomile and these have several benefits, which include the reduction of swollen eyes. Their ingredients penetrate the skin, reducing swelling. So first thing to do, wet the tea bags, put them in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes to cool. Then place on your eyes for another 20 minutes. Cucumber Slices
The use of cucumber slices also help with healing puffy eyes. Cucumbers are filled with ingredients that heal almost any ailment. However they have to be cool. First thing to do is to wash the cucumber, never assume that itâ€™s clean, then refrigerate it for about 15 minutes and cut into circular slices. Put these on your eyes for another 10 minutes or until it is no longer cool. Egg Whites
Eggs are not only for eating and for your hair. They are also very good for the skin as they help in tightening it. Use only the egg whites. Whisk the egg whites until stiff then apply on the swollen skin and leave it to dry. The skin will feel tighter and the swelling will gradually reduce. Frozen Spoon
This is such an easy hack you can try for quick, effective relief. Put an aluminum table spoon in the freezer for a few minutes and put under your eye. It works like magic. Adopting one of the methods above would help with reducing the swelling and then you can move on with your day with your normal sized eyes especially if you had a tough day or heavy night that day and you need to go out the following day.
