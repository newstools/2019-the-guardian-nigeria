Nicki Minaj may be receiving a lot of flak from fans for dating Kenneth Petty but it is obvious the couple isn’t letting any negativity get to them. Petty proved his devotion to Minaj by kissing her feet in a hot tub in a video that she shared on Instagram. The rapper and her beau are seen in the video enjoying a hot tub together and there is a lot of PDA going on as well.  Before he carries her in his arms, Petty takes her feet in his hands and kisses them. It would be recalled that Minaj recently showed her love for Petty in a very public message on her Instagram. Taking to Instagram, the multiple award-winning “Chun Li” rapper shared pictures of her and Petty’s names written in the sand inside hearts, along with Nicki’s not-so-subtle message that Onika “hearts” Zoo. And judging from this latest hot tub video, these two are still going strong in 2019. It has been reported by some quarters that Minaj is ready to settle down and have kids and is planning on doing so with Petty. A source close to her had reportedly told HollywoodLife, “Nicki has had babies on the brain for a while now. She does want kids and she’s getting to that place where she’s really ready. She’s clearly falling very hard and fast for Kenneth so he may be the lucky man to father her child.” Watch the video of their romantic hot tub display below,   Fendi PINK on.
