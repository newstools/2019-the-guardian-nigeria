We reported earlier that Hollywood actor, Jussie Smollet was attacked in a suspected homophobic and racist attack. In an update to the situation, a woman who lives in Smollett’s apartment building has told police she saw a suspicious man whom she described a “redneck” loitering just outside the entrance to the building an hour and a half before the “Empire” star says he was attacked. The woman who spoke to celebrity gossip site, TMZ on the condition of anonymity revealed she walked out of the building at 12:30 AM on Tuesday to take her dogs out and saw the man near the door, pacing between the parking garage and entrance, looking agitated and smoking a cigarette. She says, “He looked out of place. He was a white man with scruff on his face wearing a blue winter beanie, a blue zip-up sweatshirt with a hood and blue jeans that were too short, exposing “thick, grey hunting socks” with camel-colored dress shoes.” She further stated that she noticed what looked like a rope, or a clothesline, protruding from the bottom of his sweatshirt, made of white and blue material. Not only that she said he was staring at another man about 300 feet away who was standing near another entrance to the building. According to her, she got “creeped out” by the man, and after five minutes she retreated back into the building. She further went on to sleep and woke up at four AM to go to the gym, and noticed a lot of security. She says the concierge told her Smollett was attacked, and when she told him what she saw, the concierge implored her to call a detective and gave her two phone numbers. She made contact that afternoon and downloaded a detective. It would be recalled that that some reports have it that police have released photos of two persons of interest.
