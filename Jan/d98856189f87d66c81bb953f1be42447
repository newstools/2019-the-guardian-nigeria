Lonnie Corant Jaman Shuka Rashid Lynn popularly known as Common is lending his voice to the many speaking about Surviving R. Kelly. In an interview yesterday with TMZ, Common said: Obviously, R. Kelly from everything we have seen and what we are hearing, he has some issues that has to be really, really be worked on—some deep and dark heavy issues. I’m not the one to judge him, but I’m not condoning that ever. For the survivors, I feel a lot of compassion for them. We failed as a community because we knew that these things were happening and instead of trying to resolve the situation and free these young ladies, we were rocking to the music. I’m guilty [myself], he added. I didn’t stop and speak out against it. R. Kelly is from my hometown…and I can’t condone that. We failed in our communities as black people. We should have been caring about [our young black girls]. Common as featured in Selma,  Smokin’ Aces, Street Kings, American Gangster, Wanted, Terminator Salvation, Date Night, Just Wright, Happy Feet Two, Smallfoot and many others.
