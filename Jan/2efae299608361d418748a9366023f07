The leadership of Lutheran Church of Christ in Nigeria (LCCN) in collaboration with the United Adamawa Forum (UAF) and Global Peace Reconciliation Initiative has submitted a report to the United Nations Human Rights Council on the massacre going on in Numan federation, which consists of four local governments in Adamawa State. The groups’ spokesman, Bishop Peter Baths, who is the vice chairman of LCCN, told journalists in Yola, yesterday, that the report contains the human rights abuse going on in Numan federation during herdsmen attack on his people.He said: “The report looked at several cases of violation of the right to life of the indigenous people of Numan federation, as well those perceived as settlers or nomadic. President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration and the Adamawa State government under Governor Mohammed Jibrilla Bindow have failed woefully in protecting lives and property in Numan federation.” Bishop Peter, who urged the Buhari government to wake up and intensify efforts at proffering lasting solution to the killings in his area, advised government to stop excessive use of indiscriminate force in addressing violent conflicts. He said the report further recommended that, “government should protect the rights of the indigenous people of Numan federation under the same footing with the rights of communities in Nigeria, guided by the fundamental principles of equality and non-discrimination.” The groups also called on the Federal Government to enact specific legal framework and policies to safeguard the rights of children in the Northeast from girl-child abduction by insurgents, protect them from sexual violence and right to affordable quality education in safe and peaceful environment.
