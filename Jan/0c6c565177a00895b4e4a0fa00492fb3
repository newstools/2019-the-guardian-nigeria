NNPC tower The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has said politicians using the agency to canvas for votes were endangering investment inflows into the nation’s oil and gas sector. NNPC Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Ndu Ughamadu, in a statement yesterday in Abuja, regretted that the use of the corporation as a launch pad for political attacks was not only a disservice to national interest, but also inimical to the economy. He therefore cautioned political players against dropping names of some of its top management for partisan politics. Ughamdu noted that as a national oil company with partners in almost all continents of the world, the ongoing attempts by politicians to drag the name of the corporation into the murky arena of partisan politics was a potent danger to the corporation’s business interests, its multi-faceted contract deals and memoranda of understanding which ordinarily should o be insulated from political brinkmanship.
