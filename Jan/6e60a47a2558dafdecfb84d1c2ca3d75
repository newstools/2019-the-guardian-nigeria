Rihanna may have nine Grammy awards to her name and be one of the most successful entertainers of this generation, but she has always proven that she is a wonderful human being and an all-around great person. This was seemingly confirmed when a woman named Zara Rahim shared a story that proves just how incredible the singer really is. According to Rahim who shared the story on Twitter, on Wednesday, January 17,  she and Rihanna used a public bathroom together and it was a dream come true! She revealed that Rihanna not only waited in line like everyone else, but she also made small talk and made a joke to a woman who came out of the stall she was waiting for. Rahim wrote, “She was waiting for a stall to open up and I’ll never forget the woman who opened the stall door and her mouth dropped. Rihanna was standing there. Rihanna, without skipping a beat, looking directly at this very shocked woman, in her extremely Rihanna way, says “I hope you didn’t take a shit girl!!!!!” That was not all as Rahim further went on to disclose that when the “Love on The Brain” hitmaker was done doing her business, she came out of the stall, washed up, and then moisturised her hands with lotion. “The dispenser was malfunctioning because it realised it was in the presence of Rihanna,” Rahim continued. “She had too much lotion on her hands. She said ‘Give my your hands. You’re ashy sis!!!!” She rubbed her beautiful, tattooed, perfectly manicured hands on my hands.” After this, Rihanna was gone, leaving the star-struck fan with the best memory ever. It would be recalled that we recently reported that the singer slammed her father, Ronald Fenty and his business partner with a N27,225,000,000 ($75 million) lawsuit for misrepresenting their ties to her.
