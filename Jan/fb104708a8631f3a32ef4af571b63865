 Fidet Okhiria  Its Managing Director, Fidel Okhiria, yesterday in Abuja, said dismissed an website circulating on social media asking passengers to purchase tickets online, saying it is a fraudulent site and urged Nigerians to disregard it. He stated: “It is not true and have been making efforts to let people know that we have not started. That is a fraudulent website and when we do it, we will tell people.” Okhiria stressed the need for ticket sale channels to be very secure, so that people cannot hack into it and do ugly things, noting: “We have not started and Nigerians should know that we have not started the e-ticketing. “I appeal to passengers not to patronise a site for ticketing issues, as we still sell our tickets in hard copy at the stations.” He, however, disclosed that NRC has initiated the e-ticketing process was ongoing and would be under Public Private Partnership (PPP) after going through due process. Okhiria stated that by the first quarter of the year, all the processes would have been concluded to enable the commencement of automated ticketing. Manager of the Abuja-Kaduna Train Service, Paschal Nnoli, appealed to passengers to desist from fake messages requesting them to buy and reserve tickets online, as such messages didn’t emanate from NRC. “For clarity sake, NRC train tickets, for now, are obtainable in hard copy only from designated railway stations. Prospective passengers are, therefore, advised to buy their tickets only from NRC designated ticket offices and not through any other means,” he said.
