The fate of Arik Air as regards what to do with it has attracted mixed feelings among industry stakeholders.Industry experts though foresee a bleak future for the airlines, citing foreign investors’ loss of interest, the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) that manages the carrier denies the claims, saying the carrier remains on the path of full recovery from distress.
  
Recall that AMCON, a special purpose vehicle of the Federal Government for the recovery of debts, took over Arik Air in February 2017. The rationale was to save the airlines from imminent collapse, citing gross mismanagement by the owners and debt in excess of N300 billion.
  
The Federal Government quickly injected the sum of N1 billion into its operations to stabilise the airlines. Besides paying salaries and meeting basic obligations, about nine out of 30 aircraft owned by Arik returned to operation, sustaining both local and regional operations.  Ojikutu said: “Recall that at the time AMCON came, it asked for N10 billion to rejuvenate the airline even when Arik was said to owe about N300 billion. I knew then that they were not serious to rescue the airline, but to take a pound of flesh out of the bleeding carrier.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
