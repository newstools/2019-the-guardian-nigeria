Ex-militants from Niger Delta region, yesterday, demanded the immediate sack of the entire board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), and removal of the Managing Director, Mr. Nsima Ekere. The ex-militants said they were irked by the management of the intervention agency’s insensitivity. They accused the management of derailing from the commission’s tenets and not developing the region. The angry militants warned that the blatant hypocrisy and sabotage of the people by the government must stop, or they would make the region ungovernable.
Under the aegis of Third Phase Federal Government Amnesty, the ex-militants in a press statement in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital, accused Mr. Ekere of allowing his personal ambition and political ego to undermine the collective interest of the youths in the region. The statement signed by its Secretary General, Karo Edor, aka (OBJ) after their meeting in Yenagoa, said the NDDC boss lacked the vision to move the agency forward.The statement read: “We frown at the lukewarm, nonchalant and divide-and-rule tactics of the NDDC boss, which is not attracting meaningful and fair development of the region to its youths. “The NDDC boss and its board has not deemed it fit to award or bring in ex-militants for provision of surveillance jobs, water hyacinth contracts and other road repairs jobs in the region.”The group also accused the MD of leaving behind a debt profile of over N300bn for the region, and urged President Buhari to release enough fund to enable the coming board carry out its functions effectively and impact on the youths and the region.
