The chairman, Association of the People’s Democratic Party Local Government chairmen, Mohammed Musa Bayawa Augie, and some other PDP supporters from Mahyama Local Government area of the state have also defected to the All Progressives Congress. Receiving the defectors yesterday at Government House, Birnin Kebbi, the Kebbi State APC Chairman, Arc. Sani Bala Kangiwa, commended their decisions for joining the ruling party, assured them of justice and fair playing ground. He explained further that PDP as a party has lost integrity and failed to deliver the dividend of democracy to its electorate for their 16 years of their administration. Kangiwa pledged more support and encouragement from the people of Kebbi state to ensure the successful administration of APC Government in the state. While emphasising that the APC government has achieved a lot in terms of developmental projects across the country and state, he assured the people of doing more meaningful projects in the state. In his response, the leader of the defectors, Hon. Mohammed Augie assured the party leader of more support and commitment toward supporting the APC. He said they will make them win the their seconds term bids. “PDP has nothing to show for their 16years rolling, there is need to join hands together and move the state forward” he added.
