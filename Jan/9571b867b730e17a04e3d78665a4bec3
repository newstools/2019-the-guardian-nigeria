Amidst allegations of sexual abuse currently trailing embattled singer, R. Kelly, a new documentary making allegations of sexual abuse by Michael Jackson is also set to premiere. It is gathered that the documentary titled “Leaving Neverland” will premiere at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival and is reportedly accusing the legendary late singer of sexually abusing two boys. Speaking to celebrity gossip site, TMZ,  Jackson’s estate says, “This is yet another lurid production in an outrageous and pathetic attempt to exploit and cash in on Michael Jackson”. Speaking further, the King of Pop’s estate also says, “The so-called documentary is just another rehash of dated and discredited allegations. It’s baffling why any credible filmmaker would involve himself with this project”. As of the time of reporting, it is unclear which of Jackson’s accusers are the focus of the documentary but his estate apparently believes it’s Wade Robson and James Safechuck, because the estate says “both testified under oath that Michael never did anything inappropriate toward them.” It would be recalled that in  mid-1993, Evan Chandler accused the late singer of sexually abusing his 13-year-old son, Jordan “Jordy” Chandler. The relationship between Chandler and Jackson started in 1992 and was one that was so close that the media reported that Jackson had become a member of the Chandler family. However, in 1993 Chandler Snr. confronted his ex-wife June, who had custody of Jordan, with suspicions that their son had been in an inappropriate relationship with Jackson, but June dismissed his worries. Chandler then threatened to go public with the evidence he claimed to have. In January 1994, Jackson reached a financial settlement for 8,403,740 ($23,000,000) with the Chandlers.
