PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan One issue the major opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is hinging its optimism to win the forthcoming general election is the high rate of poverty tormenting the citizens ever since the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) came to power in 2015. Based on that factor, PDP says it stands a better chance to defeat the ruling party, stressing that Nigerians are frustrated by the unbearable high cost of living under President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration compared to what obtained during the 16 years of PDP. PDP’s National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, who spoke to journalists in Lagos recently, raised an alarm that the ruling party having realised it is no longer popular resorted to harassing and intimating governors serving on the platform of PDP. “But I want you to know that our governors cannot be intimidated. The PDP governors are determined and will continue to support our presidential flag bearer, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar,” he said. Ologbondiyan therefore warned the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) against taking decisions that could amount to rigging to favour a particular party or candidate. On INEC’s preparations for the election, the PDP spokesman said: “Our position on the IDPs is very clear. We are opposed to any situation that will grant INEC the powers to create new polling units under the guise of creating them for IDPs. “Nigeria has been delineated into 120,000 polling units and as such, every area has its own polling unit. So, what we are saying is, if there are IDPs in Ikeja for instance, what they need do is allow the person to transfer to the area he or she is currently staying. They do not need to create an additional 30,000 polling units. That would amount to rigging.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
