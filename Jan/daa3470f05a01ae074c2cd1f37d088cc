Reality TV star, Blac Chyna had the LAPD pay her a visit at her home after a call came in alleging she was intoxicated and neglecting her child, Dream Kardashian. According to a report by the celebrity gossip site, TMZ, an anonymous person called law enforcement on Sunday night and stated Chyna was drunk at her home. The caller claimed Chyna was in such bad shape, she couldn’t properly care for her daughter, Dream. It is further learnt that police then went over to Chyna’s house and determined everything was fine as nobody was drunk, and Dream was being properly cared for. There was also a nanny at the home. It is gathered that the cops calling incident may have been triggered by Chyna getting into a fight with a member of her glam team earlier in the night. This is coming after Chyna allegedly threw a drink at “Love & Hip Hop” star Alexis Skyy last week in response to Skyy hanging out with her ex, Rob Kardashian. We reported that Rob posted a video of himself and Skyy at his home just a couple days later.
