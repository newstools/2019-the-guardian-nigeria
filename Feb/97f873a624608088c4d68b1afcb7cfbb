The reigning queen of rap, Cardi B has revealed that she turned down an offer to perform during the 2019 Super Bowl Halftime Show out of support for former quarterback, Colin Kaepernick. The mother of one who is scheduled to perform during a pre-Super Bowl concert in Atlanta and also appear in a Super Bowl commercial explained her decision to not perform in the halftime show. She told Associated Press, “My husband [Offset], he loves football. His kids play football. It’s really hard for him. … He really wants to go to the Super Bowl, but he can’t go to the Super Bowl, because he’s got to stand for something. You have to sacrifice that,” she added. “I got to sacrifice a lot of money to perform. But there’s a man who sacrificed his job for us, so we got to stand behind him.” The 26-year-old “She Bad” rapper also explained her decision to perform at the concert. “I hear people saying like ‘Oh, y’all are saying all this stuff about the Super Bowl, but you’re doing all these parties,’” she said. “And it’s like, well, if the NFL could benefit off from us, then I’m going to benefit off y’all. Y’all make the most money off our people. Why am I not going to take advantage of y’all and take money from y’all too? Because of y’all, we are getting these parties. OK, thank you.” It would be recalled that Cardi B recently shut down rumours that she has officially reconciled with her estranged husband whom she announced a split from amidst allegations of infidelity.
