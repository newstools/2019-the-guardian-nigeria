Mrs  Jennifer Abubakar, the wife of the presidential candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has promised gender equity in government if PDP wins the Feb. 16 presidential election. Abubakar made the promise at an interactive session with women groups in Cross River on Monday in Calabar. She said that gender equity which was part of the programmes planned by a PDP administration, would be possible if women voted for the party. She charged the women to go all out and collect their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs), pointing out that there were so many uncollected cards at the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC’s) offices. “We have to start by making sure we collect our PVCs, it is our strength and there are so many uncollected PVCs with INEC. “Make sure you vote for the PDP on the Feb. 16 general election and ensure that everyone in your household comes out to vote for PDP,” she said. Abubakar said that poverty was generational and could be ended through education as indicated by the PDP in its programme. The wife of the Governor of Cross River, Dr. Linda Ayade, thanked Abubakar for coming to Cross River and said the visit had solidified the confidence of the women of the state in PDP. Ayade said the number of registered voters in the state was a little above 1.5 million and that almost half of the number were women. She said that if the women all voted in Feb 16, the state would be delivered for PDP, adding that Cross River was 100 per cent PDP and would vote for the party during the elections. Abubakar came in company with Mrs Margaret Obi, the wife of the PDP running mate, Mr Peter Obi, to launch some empowerment programmes for the women of Cross River.
