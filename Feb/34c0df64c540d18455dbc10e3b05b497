An unusual fear greeted Umuachi-Afor community in Ndokwa East Local Government Area, Delta State, as a suspected herdsmen attack has reportedly led to the death of a police officer. Many were also reported injured. The cause of the attack on the community was yet to be discovered. But the police command of the state confirmed the incident. Spokesman of the Delta State Police Command, Andrew Aniamaka, who confirmed the incident, said, “We had a situation where someone was abducted and that took our men into the bush in search of the hoodlums.” He explained that “On their way, they were ambushed by the armed herdsmen who, in fact, opened fire on the police rescue team. In the process, the ASP was hit by bullets.” The police spokesman said efforts to save the shot officer proved abortive as he died in the hospital where he was receiving treatment. Aniamaka did not disclose the identity of the deceased police officer because his family was not yet aware of the development. Reports indicated the deceased police officer was attached to the Ashaka police divisional headquarters. Aniamaka said the late officer had led a team of police officers in search of herdsmen reported to be terrorizing the area with different activities. The police spokesman, however, assured residents that “there is reinforcement into the bush and we are getting support from the local vigilante team” to arrest the criminals.
