 Issa  Aremu  Buhari recently directed security agencies to deal decisively with ballot box snatchers in the forthcoming general elections.Issa said the directive had become necessary following last Tuesday’s clash between supporters of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ojoku, Oyun Local Government Area of the state. He justified the presidential directive on potential trouble makers during the polls.The LP governorship candidate expressed shock over the reported killings that characterised the Ojoku clash. He warned that if Nigerians failed to tame thuggery, political thugs and their criminal sponsors would kill peace loving Nigerians as witnessed in Ojoku, adding that the consequences were dire for the country’s democracy.Issa applauded Buhari, the Presidential candidate of the APC for his presidential approach, urging  Nigerians to vote for candidates of their choice. He said that the Labour Party was supporting Buhari because his policies and programmes were in tune with the party’s manifestos.He called on the state government to pay them compensation for exposing them to health hazard. Aremu however sympathised with the residents of the ongoing Geri Alimi split Diamond underpass in Kwara.
