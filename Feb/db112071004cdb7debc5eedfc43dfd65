Following an official order by the Inspector General of police (IGP), Adamu Muhammed that all police personnel attached to Very Important Personalities (VIP’s) accross the country be withdrawn, thousands of officers attached to Special Protection Unit (SPU) are now “back to base” this morning. SPU is the special/commercialized unit of the Nigeria Police responsible for deploying men to VIPs, diplomats, high profile individuals, top bank and industry executives, senators, ministers amongst others. SPU personnel can be easily identified with their unique ‘blue berret’. Thousands of them are now back to the base where they would be further deployed for electoral duties. When The Guardian visited SPU Lagos base at Oduduwa Street, GRA, Ikeja this morning, thousands of the men were seen in groups, unlike before when the office is often deserted. According to one of the officers who does no want his name in print, “we came to be deployed for electoral duties. Police don’t have enough man-power, that is the reason the IG withdrew all of us. “Like me, I was one of the security details attached to a Director General, but once our ‘headmaster’ said we should come back through a signal, we don’t have any choice but to return to base.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
