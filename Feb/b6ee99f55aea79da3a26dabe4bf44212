Nigerian music star, Simi has taken to Twitter to rant about the state of Nigeria. The award-winning songstress in her post described Nigeria as a scary place to be and that most of the crazy stuff that happens is because everyone knows there would be no consequence. She further went on to say Nigerians are merely surviving and not living while also lamenting the power tussle amongst politicians in the country. The “Tiff” crooner who recently got married to her heartthrob, Adekunle Gold concluded her rant by saying she can’t be motivated to fight for the country as the problem is the country’s citizens. Read her full tweets below, Nigeria is a fucking scary place to be. The worst part is a lot of crazy stuff happens because they KNOW there will be no consequences. It’s not rocket science. But how do we get from where we are to where we need to be?? + it’s not just the government, it’s us too. — Simi (@SympLySimi) February 18, 2019  We’re just getting by. No confidence in this broken system. So we hope that today is good for us and that we see tomorrow. Rinse and repeat. Surviving, instead of actually living. — Simi (@SympLySimi) February 18, 2019  And then we have people fighting for leadership positions only to serve themselves. Not us. They really couldn’t give less of a fuck about us. STILL we turn on each other to serve them. So absolutely, ridiculously stupid! We’re supposed to be on the same side. — Simi (@SympLySimi) February 18, 2019  But it’s not enough for only a few people to think this way. Because why on earth should I fight if I know you won’t have my back. Why on earth would you fight if you think I won’t fight with you? So you see – the problem is us. — Simi (@SympLySimi) February 18, 2019
