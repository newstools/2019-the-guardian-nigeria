• We thank God For His Survival – APC
• PDP Expresses Shock Over Crash

For the second time in eight months, Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo has narrowly escaped death in two helicopter crashes in the line of duty.
Yesterday’s mishap happened in Kabba, Kogi State, during a campaign tour and the launch of TraderMoni. Osinbajo was billed to visit royal fathers in Kabba, Okene, and Idah. The chopper, which was expected to land at Kabba Township Stadium a short while after that of his advance team crash-landed when the propeller pulled out from the craft creating pandemonium as party faithful watched with bated breath. One of the accounts of the incident has it that poor visibility caused the helicopter crash. A source in the vice president’s team said as the craft made an approach to land on the dusty, bare field, massive dust was thrown up causing the pilot to lose visibility. And as he swerved towards the edge of the stadium where a bus was packed, the blade hit the bus and the helicopter landed on its side and threw up further dust. The source said that security men, who were on hand swung into action and got the occupants out without hitches and in good time.Unfazed by the near fatal encounter, the vice president returned all glory to God for keeping him and his team safe, and added that Next Level engagements would continue. The professor of law and pastor of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) said: All thanks and glory to God, the chopper we boarded today from Abuja just crash landed in Kabba, Kogi State, and the entire crew plus myself are all safe, Osinbajo said. We are continuing with our Next Level Engagements and plans for Kogi State, he added.At the Obaro of Kabba’s Palace, he said: We are extremely grateful to the Lord for preserving our lives from the incident that just happened. Everyone is safe and no one is maimed. God has kept us safe and alive, delivered us from death so we can do more for our people and country. On June 7, 2018, a chopper conveying Osinbajo from the Nigeria Customs Command and Staff College, Gwagwalada, in Abuja, forcefully landed few seconds after it took off.After that incident, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Office of the Vice President, Laolu Akande, explained that his principal avoided using his chopper from Gwagwalada where he had gone for an official assignment back to the Presidential Villa due to technical reasons. In his release titled Media Note on the crash yesterday, Akande wrote: Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, departed Abuja around 1pm today on a Chopper ride to Kogi State in continuation of the Family Chats & Next Level engagements. Prof. Osinbajo headed first to Kabba, and while landing at the Kabba Stadium, the helicopter suddenly skidded sideways until it halted on its side few metres away from the intended resting spot.Alongside VP Osinbajo, the Minister of State for Labour and Productivity, Prof. Stephen Ocheni, senior presidential aides, security officials and the crew; there were a total of 12 people on board. Everyone came out safely after the incident. We are grateful to God for His protection and safety, and we thank the crew and security personnel for their prompt response and service. We are also grateful for the tremendous expressions of concern and affection, as well as prayers from all. As is procedural, a full investigation into the causes of the incident would be conducted by aviation authorities. The ruling APC in a statement expressed gratitude to Almighty God over Osinbajo’s survival saying it prays for continuous safety of our leaders and general progress of our great country. A statement by its national publicity secretary, Malam Lanre Issa Onilu, the statement said it was heartwarming that Osinbajo is safe and sound along with his aides after the crash. The opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which expressed shock over the crash called for a thorough investigation into the traumatic incident, adding that the safety of our leaders, and of course, all Nigerians, must be guaranteed, especially at this critical time.The party urged all Nigerians irrespective of creed, ethnicity and political affiliation, to continue to pray for God’s continued intervention in our national life.
