The Gender Section of the Lagos State Police Command is investigating a case of rape reported against one Razaq Oluwaseun Oke, 28, and Don-Chima George, 25, of Dallankester Hotels, Lekki, Phase one Lagos. The duo allegedly took a girl, 23, to a club on Saturday, February 2, 2019, unknown to her that they had evil motive. While at the club, they mixed the young woman’s drink with a substance that made her weak and almost unconscious. According to Lagos State police spokesman, Chike Oti, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), “Satisfied that the drug was beginning to affect the victim, they quietly left the club with her to Dallankester Hotels in Lekki Phase one, owned by the father of one of the suspects named Don-Chima George. At the hotel, they took turns to rape her. As if that was not enough, they recorded a video of the abused girl. “When the victim woke up from the induced sleep, she confronted the suspects who denied having carnal knowledge of her. Not satisfied, she placed a call to her elder brother complaining that she had been violated. “The brother immediately invited policemen from Maroko Division led by the Divisional Police Officer, CSP Isah Abdulmajid to the scene. On searching the suspects, the DPO recovered their phones and went through their video recordings where he saw a video of the suspects sexually abusing the apparently unconscious victim”. Lagos State Commissioner of Police, CP Edgal Imohimi has directed the Gender Section of the Command to investigate and diligently prosecute the suspects to serve as deterrent to others.
