Multiple Grammy award-winning singer, Ed Sheeran may be a married man! According to multiple reports, the “Castle on the Hill” crooner and his fiancee, Cherry Seaborn got married in a private ceremony back in December 2018. The 28-year-old Sheeran is said to have wed 26-year-old Seaborn in a top-secret ceremony at his country estate in Suffolk, England, just before Christmas. The duo had wanted a private ceremony so badly it is gathered they didn’t even invite their celebrity pals. A source told The Sun, “Ed got married a few days before Christmas. It was very quiet – just Ed’s oldest school pals, limited family and the priest. There were only 40 people so no Taylor Swift, record company executives or any royals or pop star pals. He wanted no fuss and he wanted it to be something entirely for them – just a tiny winter wedding.” The source added, “It’s amazing that he’s the biggest pop star in the world but he was just able to quietly slide off and wed. Neither of them were that fussed about making a big deal about it. Cherry just wanted to get it out of the way without any problems or intrusions.” It is also gathered that although the lovebirds already made things official, the celebrations aren’t over quite yet. The newlyweds plan on having another wedding for the friends who couldn’t attend the first one. “Ed and Cherry are planning a festival-style party for a wider list to happen at the end of the summer,” the source explained to the outlet. “That will be all singing and dancing, and they’ll be able to invite Taylor and their record company colleagues and royal friends.” It would be recalled that the “Photographs” singer has been very quiet about his wedding plans since announcing his engagement to Seaborn in January 2018. In March 2018, when Sheeran was asked when the wedding was going to be, he told an Australian radio station, “We were both kind of wearing rings,” he said. “It also means that nobody will know when we have got married.”
