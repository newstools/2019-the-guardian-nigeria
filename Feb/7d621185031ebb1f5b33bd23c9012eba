Senator Dino Melaye on Thursday urged the people of Kogi West senatorial district of Kogi State to re-elect him to enable them to continue enjoying dividends of democracy. Melaye made the plea while addressing members and supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as he got his re-election campaign tour underway. The campaign took him to Chikara, Ohomoko, Gegu Beki and Koton Karfe communities in Kogi Local Government Area of the state. He said that he had attracted 149 projects to the district from 2015 till date, urging the constituents to give him their votes to enable him to do more. Melaye, who was accompanied with some party bigwigs, said he had performed better than any of his predecessors. He blamed the delay in the take-off of his campaign on forces within and outside the state but said that he was sure of victory in the coming election. The senator chided the state government for its inability to regularly pay salary and pension to workers and retirees, saying that the development had brought untold hardship to the people. According to him, former Vice President, Alhaji Abubakar Atiku, will win the coming presidential election with a wide margin and form the government that will bring succour to the people. He said that the problem of non-payment of salary and pension to workers and retirees will become a thing of the past in the country the moment Atiku takes over the reins of government. Melaye urged the people to vote all candidates of the PDP in the coming elections, saying that they cannot afford to go through another round of four years of hunger and poverty.
