 Managing Director of Jumia Food Nigeria, Mr Guy Futi  A newspaper report on February 4, 2019 claimed that Futi was arrested for fraud. But the firm in a statement signed by Ogunfowoke Adeniyi said the report was fabricated and simply untrue. It reads: “The current Managing Director of Jumia Food Nigeria, Mr Guy Futi neither misappropriated the company’s funds nor converted them for personal use. If this had happened, Jumia would have taken legal action against him, and probably involved the press. “He was never involved in any fraudulent act. Mr. Futi was invited for questioning by the Nigerian Police Force on Thursday, January 31, 2019 in relation to an ongoing case of fraud filed by Jumia Food against one of its vendors, Castle Logistics Services. “Mr. Futi was never detained by the police. He left the station after the interrogation same day. At the time the incident for which Jumia took legal action against Castle Logistics occurred, Mr. Futi had not joined the company.” The firm stated that the allegation of fraud by Castle Logistics it, is a malicious attempt to distract Jumia Food from carrying out legal action against the company and condemned the “libelous” story, adding that they are completely untrue.
