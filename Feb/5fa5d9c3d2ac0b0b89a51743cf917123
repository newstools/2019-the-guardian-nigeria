Rappers Meek Mill and Drake have shared the official video for “Going Bad,” a track off Meek Mill’s chart-topping album CHAMPIONSHIPS.
The Philadelphia rapper teased the release of the visual on social media Wednesday, sharing a clip in which he and Drizzy are seen channeling mobster vibes and stunting in Rolls Royce Phantoms. This is rather excellent news considering the fact that the artistes had a highly publicized beef and this video would be the first music video in which parties would appear together since the beef ended.
Meek Mill and Drake brought closure to their long-standing beef last summer during the Aubrey & the Three Migos Tour stop in Boston. Meek performed “Dreams and Nightmares,” while Drizzy served as his hype man. “This really gave me peace of mind tonight,” Drake wrote about the performance. “Healing and moving forward created one of the most electric and gratifying moments of my career. @meekmill I’m happy that you are home and that we could find our way back to our joint purpose.” watch the video for “Going Bad” below;
