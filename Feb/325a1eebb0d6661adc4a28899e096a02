A Federal High Court in Abuja has granted the former Secretary-General of the Federation, Babachir Lawal and two others bail in the sum of N50m each with one surety. This came after Lawal appeared in court for the first time on Tuesday since his dismissal two years ago over the allegations of fraud to which he pleaded not guilty. The former SGF was arraigned alongside five others by the Economic and Financial Crime Commission on 10-count charges of fraudulent diversion of funds meant to assist persons displaced by Boko Haram. He was removed from office in October 2017 after a three-man committee comprising Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, National Security Adviser Mohammed Babagana Monguno and Attorney-General and Justice Minister Abubakar Malami was set up by President Muhammadu Buhari to investigate the allegations against him. Osinbajo submitted a report into the claims in August 2017 suggesting his sack. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
