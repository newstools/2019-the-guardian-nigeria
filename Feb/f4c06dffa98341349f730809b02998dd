Embattled Hollywood actor, Jussie Smollett has issued an apology to the members of the set of “Empire”. His apology came shortly after he was released on bail. It is gathered that the actor is said to have been bailed with the sum of N36,212,000 ($100k) as police insist he staged his attack for a pay rise. After he left the courtroom, the screen star had to dodge a mob, but cars and news choppers still followed his movement. He was patiently awaited by “Empire” set members for his scene. When he did, he begged them and told them he never did what he’s being accused of. ”…I’m sorry I’ve put you all through this and not answered any calls. I wanted to say I’m sorry and, you know me, I would never do this to any of you, you are my family. I swear to God, I did not do this,” Smollett said. It would be recalled that stars like Cardi B, Trevor Noah and some others have reacted to Smollett allegedly staging his attack. While Cardi said he ruined Black History Month if he lied, Noah said Smollett’s deserves an Oscar if he is lying about the attack.
