Presidential candidates of Young Progressives Party (YPP) Kingsley Moghalu and that of the Alliance for New Nigeria (ANN) Fela Durotoye have condemned violence and killings during Nigeria’s presidential and National Assembly elections. Ballot snatching, killings and other forms of violence characterised Nigeria’s general election that commenced on Saturday, February 23. Contrary to hitch-free polls promised to citizens by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agencies, about 11 people were declared dead during the elections in Rivers State and other parts of the country. Reacting to the violence-marred elections, Moghalu and Durotoye said the death and violence reports were a wrong way of rewarding citizens’ act of patriotism. “My heartfelt sympathy goes to those who lost their loved ones that only came out to perform their civic duty. Also, those who were maimed, those who were not given the opportunity to vote due to stolen ballots/boxes and thuggery, those who were forced to vote for a candidate other than their choice,” Moghalu said. Moghalu also “sympathised with Youth Corpers who were put in harm’s way all because they were called to serve their fatherland.” The YPP presidential candidate added that “This is not how things should be and that is the structure we are working hard to influence.” ANN presidential candidate Fela Durotoye, who expresses displeasure in the violence during the election, said “Nothing is worth the pain they (victims) now feel” “It’s heartbreaking to hear about people losing their lives and getting hurt because of electoral violence all across Nigeria. Many families have forever lost sleep, knowing they’d never see their loved ones again,” Durotoye said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
