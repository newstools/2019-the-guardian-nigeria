 Two kidnap suspects, Agu Izuchukwu, 19 and Tunde Olaewo, 21  The police said that the victim, an oil and gas merchant identified as Solomon Orungo, who resides at Bucknor area of Ejigbo in Lagos State, was being trailed by the suspects before they were arrested. One of the suspects, Agu Izuchukwu, told detectives that they were determined to collect the sum of N60 million from their boss’ family before setting him free. “We would have been N60 million richer if our plans to abduct our boss had gone through. But unfortunately for us, we were arrested while perfecting our plans,” Agu said. The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Muazu Zubairu, who paraded the suspects yesterday during his maiden press conference, said the gang members were nabbed based on credible information. The Lagos police boss said the suspects were apprehended based on credible intelligence received that some newly employed staff of one Solomon Otungo, an oil and gas merchant, were holding nocturnal meetings on how they would kidnap and keep their employer incommunicado until a ransom of N60 million is paid. He said based on the information, the Divisional Police Officer in charge of Ejigbo Police Station, swiftly mobilized police detectives and stormed the venue of the meeting where the employees, Agu Izuchukwu and Tunde Olaewo were promptly rounded up and brought to the station. “The confessional statements of the suspects led to the arrest of one Sunday Nwankwo in Isolo area of Lagos. The suspects in unison have confessed to the crime.” Zubairu said the suspects would be charged to court at the conclusion of investigation.
