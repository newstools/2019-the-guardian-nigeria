The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) is to move against Governor Ibikunle Amosun in Ogun State over what it termed “anti-worker actions of the government.”Tagged “Operation Occupy Ogun State” and scheduled for this Friday, the protest is to be led by the union’s national president, Comrade Ayuba Wabba. In a letter dated February 20, 2019 and addressed to the governor, Wabba hinted that the action would keep the state locked down until the workers’ demands are met. One of the grievances contained in the correspondence obtained yesterday by The Guardian includes “backlog of salary deductions and gratuity.Others are alleged failure by the government to reinstate the state chairman of the congress, Akeem Ambali, and “the plight of workers of the Tai Solarin College of Education, Omu-Ijebu.” He regretted that the Amosun administration had allegedly refused to “address the issues earlier raised in various letters dated December 10, 2018, January 16, 2019, and February 8, 2019.” The letter read in part “Given the intransigence of the Ogun government to respond to earlier entreaties by the NLC, organised Labour in Nigeria has no other option left than to keep the state on an industrial lockdown until our demands are met.”They include: “Liquidation of about 104 months arrears of withheld statutory deductions owed workers and unions in Ogun in line with the agreement reached between the state government and organised labour that the last tranche of Paris Club refund be used for this purpose.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
