 Borno State governor Kashim Shettima PHOTO: TWITTER/GOVERNOR BORNO  Three persons died in the attack, Shettima’s media aide Isa Gusau said in a statement. He said the governor will meet families of those “affected”. The governor said the attack was “aimed to attract local and global media attention in order to sustain propaganda strategy and to instil fear in citizens and gallant troops.” “The unfortunate incident will not make the Governor have doubt in the capacity of the gallant and patriotic personnel of the Nigerian armed forces who have dedicated their lives fighting for peace and the freedom of Borno people,” Gusau said. ISWAP claimed the attack. In a broadcast, on Amaq News Agency the sect said it killed 42 people in the attack when the governor was returning from a campaign outing near Dikwa. Some of those killed may have been beheaded, a military source told Reuters. The Guardian learned on Wednesday that the insurgents ambushed the convoy, split it into two and attacked the one left at the rear. Another source told AFP that two soldiers and two civilians were killed and an unspecified number of ruling All Progressives Congress members were kidnapped. “The bus they were travelling in got stuck in the sand while the driver was trying to manoeuvre and turn back towards Dikwa,” the source told AFP. “All the people in the bus were rounded up and taken into the bush. Another truck belonging to CJTF, which also got stuck, was taken away but the occupants were able to flee.” The state government, however, said it is still expecting full security briefing to get accurate information on the incident.
