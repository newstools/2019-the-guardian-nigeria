They are charged with “killing by negligence,” according to the NTV television. The eight-storey block where 43 people were registered as living crumbled last week but the cause still remains unclear. Local officials said three storeys were illegally added — a common practice in the country’s largest metropolis of around 15 million people. The collapse fanned criticism of a government amnesty granted last year to people accused of illegal building — a measure announced ahead of municipal elections this March. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who visited the site on Saturday, said authorities have “lessons to learn” from the incident.
