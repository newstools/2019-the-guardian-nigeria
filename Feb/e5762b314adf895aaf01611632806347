Following the postponement of the general elections, the Nigerian government on Saturday announced it has reopened its borders to neighbouring African countries. “The honourable minister of interior Abdulrahman Bello Dambazau has ordered the reopening of all the land borders earlier closed due to the postponement of the elections earlier scheduled for 16th, February 2019,” Comptroller general of immigration Muhammad Banbadede said in a statement. Nigeria’s electoral body, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) postponed the general elections a few hours to the commencement with the presidential and National Assembly elections on Saturday, February 16 2019. The presidential and National Assembly elections will hold on February 23 while the governorship and state houses of assembly elections will take place on March 9. Babandede assured Nigerians that “Nigeria Immigration Officers will continue their normal duties to ensure that all persons crossing our land, air and sea borders travel with valid and genuine documents and also pass through recognised routes.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
