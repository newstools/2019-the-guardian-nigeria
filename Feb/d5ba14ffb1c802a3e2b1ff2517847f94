 [FILE PHOTO] Vice-presidential candidate of the PDP, Mr Peter Obi  Obi told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday at his Amatutu Ward 2 voting centre at Agulu in the Anaocha Local Government Area of Anambra that it took a while for the card reader to clear him before he voted. ”Before I voted, it took a while for the card reader to identify my card. People who came earlier than 8.45 a.m. when I voted complained of the same problem. Calls I am still getting across the state still point to that.” Obi named Umuowerre, Nneogidi Nri ward one, two and three etc. all in Anaocha as places with reports of malfunctioning card readers. He disclosed that he had also received calls from many other areas of Anambra that card readers were malfunctioning, expressing his worry over the development. Obi said that it was unnecessary for the electoral body to register 91 political parties and listed them on the ballot paper. ”All that should be done is to have not more than 12 political parties on the ballot paper, if INEC can do better during elections.” Obi, however, called on INEC to ensure that every eligible voter cast his vote, saying ”disenfranchising any Nigerian on account of clumsy process will be a great disservice by the commission”.
