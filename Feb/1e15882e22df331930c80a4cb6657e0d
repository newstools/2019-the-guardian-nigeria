The Niger State Chapter of the National Agency for Food, Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) says it has concluded arrangements to go after unscrupulous persons packaging unhealthy table water for sale in the state. Mr Anikoh Ibrahim, NAFDAC Coordinator in the state, disclosed this during an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Minna on Monday. Ibrahim said that there was need to monitor the activities of such persons who package unhealthy table water and endangering public health. “Now that the dry season has set in, people tend to consume more water because of the heat. “We are going to monitor water factories because of the activities of unscrupulous elements who want to take advantage of our people to make money. “These people who are not registered and certified, produce unhealthy water in their kitchens and backyards and sell to unsuspecting members of the public. “Any of us can drink such water, so there is need to guard against the activities of such bad eggs in the society,’’ Ibrahim said. He said that the practice was a public health concern that could cause waterborne diseases and other health issues. “Nobody can guarantee the source and safety of such water because the producers are not registered and certified. According to him, even producers of packaged water that are registered and certified are still monitored to protect the public’s health. The coordinator urged the state chapter of the Association of Table Water Producers to adhere strictly to the agency’s guidelines or be ready to face sanctions. He warned that NAFDAC would not compromise its mandate of safeguarding public health by allowing persons with sinister motives to risk the lives of citizens. Ibrahim called on members of the public to report to the agency, or security agencies, any suspected unregistered and un-certified package water producers near them for prompt action.
