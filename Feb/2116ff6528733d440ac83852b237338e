 Opening Remarks by INEC Chairman Prof. Mahmood Yakubu at the ongoing National Briefing Of Accredited Observers (Domestic and Foreign) for the 2019 General Elections.  My worst fear is that if the present cabal that controls the Nigerian Presidency succeeds in imposing itself on the people in the election, the country might slide into the unexpected. This is because there is a powerful class of religious supremacists in the country who see President Muhammadu  Buhari as their last chance to conquer the country to serve their group interest.  Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State recently expressed the desperation of this class when he issued an ominous threat to foreign election observers during a live discussion on National Television Authority (NTA). He said among other things: “Those that are calling for anyone to come and intervene in Nigeria, we are waiting for the person that would come and intervene, they would go back in body bags.”  (Solomon Fowowe, El-Rufai threatens death on foreigners that interfere in Nigeria’s elections, The Guardian, February 6, 2019)
   
Governor El-Rufai is not a road-side hoodlum. He is a member of a well-organised class of powerful Nigerians. His threat was not a Freudian slip. As Senator Shehu Sani of Kaduna State wisely advised, Governor El-Rufai’s threat should be taken seriously by Nigerians and the international community. My fear in this regard is aggravated by the fact that at the present time, most Southern economic, political and religious elite are not conscious of powerful undercurrents propelling their country towards a destination that is antithetical to democracy. They read the lips rather than the actions of political leaders and are therefore are easily misled.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
