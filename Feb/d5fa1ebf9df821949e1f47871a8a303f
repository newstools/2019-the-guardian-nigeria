 Wikki Tourists’ goalkeeper, Pius Ibrahim goes for the ball during a recent NPFL game against Enugu Rangers.  The boys from Bauchi are currently sixth with nine points on the log after seven matches, while the Flying Antelopes are in the 11th position with six points, having played just three matches due to their continental engagement in the CAF Confederation Cup. Speaking to The Guardian yesterday, Coach Zubairu said today’s encounter against their hosts is as important as other games, adding that his boys will ensure they did not lose in Enugu. “We know they are a big side on the continent with a good coach and players with high pedigree and I respect them very well. But that is not to say we cannot pick a point there. I know they are beatable because since the beginning of this year they have also lost some matches in the domestic league. “Though my team is still very young, but they are a highly dedicated bunch of players who are hungry for success and want to make names for themselves. I think the team still have a long way to go,” he stated. Other matches today in Group A include Kwara United welcoming Niger Tornadoes, Bendel Insurance hosting Rivers United, Katsina United’s trip to Enyimba, as well as the games between MFM and Sunshine Stars and Lobi Stars versus Remo Stars at the Aper Aku Stadium. In Group B fixtures, it will be Gombe versus Go Round, Nasarawa United against Yobe Desert Stars, Plateau United against Kada City, Abia Warriors versus Kano Pillars, Akwa United against Ifeanyi Ubah and Heartland FC versus El-Kanemi.
