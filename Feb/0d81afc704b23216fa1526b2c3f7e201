Ike Shorunmu Former Super Eagles goalkeeper, Ike Shorunmu, has charged the Nigeria U-20 national team, Flying Eagles not to be scared of any team ahead of the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup holding in Poland. Speaking on the Flying Eagles opponents after the World Cup draws held at the weekend, Shorunmu said Nigeria’s group D opponents, USA, Ukraine and Qatar were not strong enough to give the Eagles a tough fight at the cadet World Cup, following the countries pedigree in age group competitions. Drawing from the U-20 national team past record at the world championships, Shorunmu called on the team handlers to work hard and pick the best players that would make football-loving Nigerians proud in Poland. He noted that the Flying Eagles had equal chances with other teams to win the world tournament, if the team is given the best preparations. “I don’t understand why people are calling the Flying Eagles group the group of death. All the teams that will attend the event, including Nigeria, are not pushovers. The Flying Eagles have played in the finals of the U-2O World Cup before so, I believe other teams in the championship will also be afraid of them. “Nigerians should not write off the team because of their performance at the Africa championship in Niger Republic. The coach have already seen the lapses in the team, he will work ahead to raise a formidable squad for the U-20 World Cup,” he said. 24 teams will be participating in the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup, with six Polish cities hosting the championship.
