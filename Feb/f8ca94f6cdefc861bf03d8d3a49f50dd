Fast rising emcee, Emeka Ejechi well known as Hotyce, who recently lost his father, has come through with the video to one of the tape’s standout records titled Red Light, a collaboration with veteran rapper/producer, Jesse Jagz, from his debut album, RedHotYceCold Vol 1, which he released last year ‘Red Light’, a six-minute 100 per cent heavy hip-hop project, is his second collaboration with Jesse Jagz following their previous work on Dirty, which had HotYce spitting some fiery punch lines as Jargo (Jesse Jagz) brings the reggae spiced hook. Emmeno produced the record; it was mixed and mastered by Focus Ramon, while video was shot through the lens of hip-hop culture savvy music video director, Director ‘MEX’ of Mex Films. Born in Lagos and raised in Abuja, Hotyce is the youngest in a family of seven and from the age of six his older brothers exposed him to all kinds of music genres, which help him to develop music appreciation. Currently signed to K2O Entertainment, he began his sojourn into rap music whilst in secondary school, miming songs of his idols including music heavyweights like Dr Dre, Tupac, Snoop Dogg, Nas, Abami Eda (weird one) Fela Anikulapo Kuti, Shola Amah, and Shade Adu for his friends and family, which in turn led him to begin to write his own songs. He moved back to Lagos in 2016 after bagging a degree in Economics from the University of Abuja. This was around the same time he began rapping officially. As a rap artiste, Hotyce put himself through an exercise of weekly freestyles on social media, which he calls the Friday Night Massacre. “Every Friday from 2017 to 2018, I was dropping a new freestyle video on Instagram,” he said. This has not only helped him sharpen his skills, but also help build a buzz and demand for his music – culminating in the release of his debut album ‘RedHOTYCEcold Vol1’.
