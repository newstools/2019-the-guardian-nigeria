 [FILES] The leader of Islamic Movement of  Nigeria otherwise known as Shi”te, Ibrahim El-Zakzaky  This followed Atiku’s recent petition to the European Union (EU), United States of America (U.S.A.) and the United Kingdom (UK), in which he alleged human rights violations manifest in the Muhammadu Buhari-led government. Atiku’s petition had cited the violation of some individuals’ rights including Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky and his family members in spite of a Federal High Court order for the unconditional release of the IMN leader. The, letter which was written by the Resource Forum of IMN and signed by Dr. Y.S Yusuf conveyed Zakzaky’s appreciation claiming that over 1000 persons were killed extra-judicially and buried in different mass graves during the Zaria massacre and that Zakzaky was shot at close range but he survived. However, Atiku has accused governors of diverting funds meant for local governments, promising to abolish the Local Government Joint Account if elected president of the country. He stated this yesterday at his campaign rally in Birnin-Kebbi, Kebbi State, accusing governors of diverting money from the local governments joint account. He added that if elected President he would fight for the cancellation of the joint account, saying it was illegal. “I promise to abolish it because the governors hide under it to syphon the money,” he added, urging the people of Kebbi State to vote out APC as the party stood for poverty and promised to empower youths and women. Speaking, Sokoto State Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwa appealed to the people of the state to vote for PDP, as was the only party that could eradicate poverty in the country.
