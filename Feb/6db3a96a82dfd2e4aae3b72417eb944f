• Flying Antelopes target three points this weekend
Enugu Rangers’ Technical Adviser, Christian Chukwu says the Flying Antelopes could not come out victorious in their 2019 CAF Confederation Cup game against Etoile du Sahel of Tunisia at the weekend because the players found it difficult to cope with the cold weather in the North African country. Chukwu notes that the defeat in Tunisia was an eye-opener for Rangers, saying they now know how to beat Etoile du Sahel when they come to Nigeria for the return fixture billed for Enugu on March 3.He reveals that Enugu Rangers’ players and coaches have started preparing for the encounter, stressing that getting the three points to return to the top of the group log is the team’s target. “Rangers are 100 percent focused on beating Etoile du Sahel on Sunday in the return leg fixture of the CAF Confederation Cup. “We lost in Tunisia to the cold weather which affected the players adversely. They have not been exposed to such weather condition before. “Officiating in that game is something I don’t even want to talk about. But I can assure football loving Nigerians that we will beat the North Africans here and pick the three points.’ He said the team has seen the weaknesses of Etoile du Sahel, adding, “this would give the team the advantage over the North Africans on Sunday. There is no form of pressure in the Flying Antelopes camp.”The former Harambee Stars of Kenya coach says the Rangers management will put the necessary things in place to ensure the players are psychologically fit for the cracker.
