Also confirming the development, Caverton Helicopters, in a statement signed by its Managing Director, Capt. Josiah Choms, said the relevant aviation agencies had been informed about the incident. Choms said “An Augusta AW139 Helicopter, under management by Caverton Helicopters was involved in a mishap on landing in Kabba, Kogi State on Feb. 2 as a result of unusual weather conditions. “There were no injuries to the passengers or crew on board and they were all quickly and safely evacuated. “The relevant authorities have been duly informed and an investigation into the incident has commenced. We will, of course, support the authorities as required. “We wish to reassure the public and our various stakeholders of our unwavering commitment to safety in all our operations,” he said.
