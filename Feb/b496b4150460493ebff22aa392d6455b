According to him, “Have I said anything and not done it. I work with God and He has always seen me through. Anyone who plays God, is bound to end in doom. God can’t share His glory with anyone.” “This is how it would be during the Governorship Election. The tenure of a Governor is eight years and I will have my eight years.
