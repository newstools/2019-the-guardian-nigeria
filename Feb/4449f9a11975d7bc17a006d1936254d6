Outspoken Grammy award-winning rapper, Cardi B has slammed Jussie Smollet over his claims that he was attacked. Cardi B’s public call-out is coming after recent evidence suggests that the “Empire” star possibly staged the alleged homophobic and racist attack on him. According to Cardi B, his actions ruined Black History Month. Reacting to the new development which is beginning to make people doubt Jussie Smollet, Cardi B shared, “I’m really disappointed in Jussie Smollett- whatever the f*ck his name is. I’m really disappointed in him. I feel like he f*cked Black History Month, bro. Godd*mn. I’m not gonna say yet- until he say it out his mouth that it was fake and this sh*t was staged, I don’t wanna completely blame him, because somebody I was talking to- they said police in Chicago are racist. So they might probably trying to frame him, and make him look like he’s a liar. But if he’s not, then, bro, you f*cked up, forreal. Like, why would you do that? Like, you ain’t have to do that. Then, you gave f*cking Donald Trump immunity to f*cking laugh at n*ggas and sh*t. [You’ make m*=otherf*ckers look bad. Sh*t brazy, bro.” It would be recalled that Smollet had alleged that he was attacked last month in Chicago by two men who hurled racist slur at him. He also said they chanted “this is MAGA country”, a statement which led many into believing it was done by Trump supporters. However, investigations which led to the arrest of two Nigerian brothers have hinted at the possibility that Smollet may have staged the attack by paying the two black men to attack him.
