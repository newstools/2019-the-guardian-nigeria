A businesswoman, Tope Ogba, has narrated to the Lagos Violence and Sexual Offences Court sitting in Ikeja, how her husband, Ogba Gabriel, allegedly raped their two adult daughters.

Momoh-Ayokambi, Ogba said she did not know what was going on, not until he assaulted her third daughter and he almost set her ablaze when she reported him to the authorities. “I did not know what was going on until he assaulted my third daughter. I have been the breadwinner of the family. I got to know about the assault of my third daughter from her teacher. I later heard about the assault of my older daughters from people outside. When I asked my older daughters about the rumours, they initially denied it. “I confronted my husband, he said that it was a gang up and conspiracy against him by our daughters, I told him that a young child cannot come up with such allegations against him. He had been threatening me since I confronted him, he beat me and I have no peace at home.” She further told court he became aggressive at home after she reported him. She was cross-examined by defendant counsel, E. Obelu.
