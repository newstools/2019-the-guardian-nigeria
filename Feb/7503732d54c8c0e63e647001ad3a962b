Former Minister of State for Defence, Sen. Musiliu Obanikoro The trial of the immediate past governor of Ekiti State, Mr. Ayodele Fayose, resumed yesterday with former Minister of State for Defence, Musiliu Obanikoro, testifying against him. Under cross-examination by the second defence counsel, Mr. Olalekan Ojo (SAN), Obanikoro told the court that he was testifying against Fayose reluctantly, adding that they enjoyed a good relationship in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The witness has since defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). He said despite testifying against Fayose, who still pitches his tent with the PDP, he wouldn’t want their relationship strained. At a point, Obanikoro stated: “I’m trying to restrain myself from saying things that will further damage our relationship.” But pushing him further Ojo asked: “So, will it be correct to say that you are giving evidence in this case reluctantly?” Responding, the erstwhile minister stated: “It’s painful for me to give evidence against him (Fayose). No doubt about it. It is indeed very painful.” The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) is prosecuting erstwhile governor for allegedly receiving N2.2 billion from the then National Security Adviser, Col. Sambo Dasuki (rtd), to prosecute his gubernatorial ambition in 2014. The anti-graft agency claimed the sum was delivered to him by Obanikoro. Consistent with his stance, the witness yesterday affirmed that he took the money to the accused in Ado Ekiti as a PDP leader on a mission for his then political party. Earlier, first defence counsel, Chief Kanu Agabi (SAN), asked the ex-minister if he was earlier treated as a suspect by the EFCC during its investigation which replied in the affirmative.
