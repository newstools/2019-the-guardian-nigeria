Things have escalated rather quickly as Chris Brown is clapping back at Offset after the Migos member called him out for sharing a meme that appeared to mock 21 Savage’s legal troubles and potential deportation.
As previously reported, Chris Brown had posted a video in which 21’s 2016 XXL Freshman cypher was edited to feature the vocals of Big Shaq, a U.K.-based rapper/comedian. <img src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/chris-brown-instagram-post-1-419x598.jpeg" alt="" width="419" height="598" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-851708 lazyload" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/chris-brown-instagram-post-1-419x598.jpeg 419w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/chris-brown-instagram-post-1-808x1152.jpeg 808w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/chris-brown-instagram-post-1-391x557.jpeg 391w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/chris-brown-instagram-post-1-781x1114.jpeg 781w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/chris-brown-instagram-post-1-168x240.jpeg 168w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/chris-brown-instagram-post-1-337x480.jpeg 337w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/chris-brown-instagram-post-1-421x600.jpeg 421w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/chris-brown-instagram-post-1.jpeg 1242w" sizes="(max-width: 419px) 100vw, 419px" /> Offset commented on the post simply with, “Memes ain’t funny lame.”
Though the Migos member’s response was far from mocking, Chris Brown was quick to fire back with insults and even challenged him to a fight. He commented; “Fuck you lil boy. Better worry about what u got going and focus on ‘you,'” Brown wrote. “All this cap on IG is what’s lame. Yo energy wont like that when I came to Drake show in LA. If you don’t get yo a hip a hop a hibbet a hibbet to the hip hip hop and ya don’t stop the rockin faceass out of my comments. Sensitive ass nigga. Call me personally. U want some clout when all u gotta do is pull up no camera, no flexing and all at!!! If you a real man fight me. Oh and another thing, suck my dick!” <img src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chris-Brown-comment-632x598.jpeg" alt="" width="632" height="598" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-851711 lazyload" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chris-Brown-comment-632x598.jpeg 632w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chris-Brown-comment-1218x1152.jpeg 1218w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chris-Brown-comment-487x461.jpeg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chris-Brown-comment-974x921.jpeg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chris-Brown-comment-254x240.jpeg 254w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chris-Brown-comment-507x480.jpeg 507w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chris-Brown-comment-600x568.jpeg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chris-Brown-comment.jpeg 1242w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" />
Offset then responded to Brown’s insults via Instagram Stories: “Coke head don’t want [smoke emoji]” <img src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Offset-instastory-315x598.jpeg" alt="" width="315" height="598" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-851714 lazyload" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Offset-instastory-315x598.jpeg 315w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Offset-instastory-606x1152.jpeg 606w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Offset-instastory-293x557.jpeg 293w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Offset-instastory-586x1114.jpeg 586w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Offset-instastory-126x240.jpeg 126w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Offset-instastory-253x480.jpeg 253w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Offset-instastory-316x600.jpeg 316w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Offset-instastory.jpeg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" /> Offset Fires At Chris Brown Over Insensitive Post
