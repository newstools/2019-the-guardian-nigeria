Customers who had already paid a deposit by January 17 will not be affected by the potential tariff hikes, it added. It remains uncertain whether Britain will strike a deal with the EU by March 29, and car manufacturers have joined other industries in calling for urgent clarity on what the future trade relationship might look like. Business leaders fear a hard or no-deal Brexit could lead to import duties on EU goods arriving into the UK and different regulatory requirements that would badly disrupt supply chains. Porsche sold 14,000 cars in Britain in 2017, making it the firm’s second-biggest market in Europe after Germany. According to Bloomberg News, the starting price of Porsche’s Macan compact SUV would jump from £46,344 (52,880 euros, $59,825) to £50,978 if the 10-percent surcharge were imposed.
