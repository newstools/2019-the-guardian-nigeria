Getting to the group stage of CAF Confederation Cup shows that Burkina Faso’s Salitas is a tough team, Enugu Rangers’ Technical Adviser, Christian Chukwu, has said. Rangers will face the Burkinabe side today in their Group B opening game of the competition and Chukwu believes the Flying Antelopes must be at their very best to get the desired victory at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium, Enugu. Chukwu told The Guardian that Rangers are aware that Salitas are coming for an away win, or at least, a draw, adding, however, that they would be surprised by what the Flying Antelopes would do to them.He revealed that Rangers FC were in the right frame of mind for the game, adding that the players had been through a lot of psychological drilling ahead of the match. He called on Nigerians to turn out en masse to support the Flying Antelopes, as they begin another phase in the CAF Confederation Cup campaign.“We are already used to the competition. The game would be tough, but I believe Enugu Rangers are ready to beat any strategy the Burkinabes will bring to the game. “The city of Enugu is bubbling now and the fans are ready to give the team total support,” he said. Chukwu disclosed that the Burkinabes were already in town, adding that Rangers’ players were also poised to get the right result to keep the team in top contention in the championship. In the other game of Group B, Tunisians, Etoile du Sahel and CS Sfaxien will meet in a local derby in Tunis, as the battle for the 2019 CAF Confederation Cup semifinals berth.
