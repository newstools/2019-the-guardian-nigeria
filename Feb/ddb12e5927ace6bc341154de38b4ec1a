The Gidi Culture Festival was created in response to a demand from the local youth culture for live, affordable, and accessible entertainment in Africa. The festival provides a venue for live bands, DJs and musical acts to perform. It also features outdoor activities, local vendors, and artisans. The main show usually features a line-up of African acts from countries including Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Congo, Kenya and United Kingdom. The goal is to encourage the development of African talent and promote artistes both within the continent and into overseas markets.
