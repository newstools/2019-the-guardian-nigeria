The US and other countries are trying to help, but Venezuela’s military under Maduro’s orders is blocking aid with trucks and shipping tankers,” Pompeo tweeted. “The Maduro regime must LET THE AID REACH THE STARVING PEOPLE,” Pompeo wrote, using capital letters for emphasis. Opposition leader Juan Guaido, who has been recognized as interim president by the United States and major Latin American and European countries — has been trying to bring in assistance led by Washington with Brazil and Colombia.
