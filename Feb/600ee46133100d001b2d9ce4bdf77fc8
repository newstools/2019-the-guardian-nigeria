The National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) last night held a secret meeting with state chairmen, secretaries and candidates contesting for governorship and senatorial elections across the country. It was gathered that the “special meeting” chaired by the party’s national chairman Adams Oshiomhole was called to perfect plans aimed at sweeping Saturday’s presidential election and National Assembly contest. A source who asked not to be named said “having campaigned as expected, the party leaders should also be informed of the challenges and other things we are facing on the field. Again, we are also expected to receive instructions on how to go about the contest from our leaders in the NWC. “ Journalists who were initially invited to cover the event were told in clear terms to go away as the parley was not “a media event.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
