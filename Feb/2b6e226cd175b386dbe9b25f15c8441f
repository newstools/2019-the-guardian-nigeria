Tech giant Google has reacted to the inaccurate figures witnessed in the conversion rate of Nigeria’s Naira currency on the eve of the country’s presidential and parliamentary elections. “We’re aware of an issue causing inaccurate conversions for Nigerian Naira currency, so we will remove the conversion one box from appearing in search results until we are able to diagnose the issue,” Google said in a tweet late on Friday. Search result on Google showed a dollar was equivalent to N184. During the same period, a dollar was traded officially for N306, information on Nigeria’s central bank website showed. While the drastic reduction in the conversion rates was noted on Google, other currency conversion mediums remained the same way they were.
 On xe.com, for instance, N362.6 was exchanged for a $1. But Google said it was aware of the inaccuracies and will correct it to correspond with the global conversion rates. The tech company, however, did not state the cause of the inaccuracies. Google said the search result will be diagnosed to identify the issue.
