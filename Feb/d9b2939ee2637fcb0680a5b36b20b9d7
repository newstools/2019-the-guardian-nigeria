Sensational Nigerian comedian, Woli Arole has taken to his Instagram page to lament the postponement of the 2019 general elections by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The comedian in his post shared images of the poor condition some corp members and ad-hoc staffs were made to survive in while wondering how they would transport themselves back home. He then went on to offer assistance to those stranded after the INEC postponement. He shared, “These are pictures of people that volunteered to be INEC officials today ooooo, no accommodation, no security many of them are CORPERS, and yet INEC postponed the ELECTION. Please, what would these ones do when they get stranded? how would they feed? How would they transport themselves?. This is so SAD. Abeg if you are a CORPER or you are amoung any of these people and you are STRANDED. DM me quickly so I can support you in any way I can. This is just SAD.”   These are pictures of people that volunteered to be INEC officials today ooooo, no accomodation, no security many of them are CORPERS, and yet INEC postponed the ELECTION.
