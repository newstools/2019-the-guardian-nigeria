Music mogul, Sean Combs better known by the name P. Diddy or simply Diddy may have found love again following his publicised split from singer, Cassie Ventura whom he dated for 10 years. According to new reports, the “Coming Home” rapper is dating Gina Huynh, a model and an ex to boxing champion Floyd Mayweather. Since he broke his 10-year relationship with singer Cassie, many have been speculating on who the “I Need A Girl” rapper would start a new relationship with especially considering that Cassie has moved on to a new man, Alex Fine. He recently opened up on the pressure he’s been facing from friends who want him to start dating again. “I ain’t gonna lie — my friends have been asking me if I’m ‘single Diddy’ yet. I’m single motherf–king Diddy. I ain’t gonna lie!”, he said. Cupid may have struck Diddy with an arrow after his failed attempts to win Cassie back as he decided to flirt with his ex, Hunynh instead and the two are now reportedly dating once again. This comes after an Instagram flirtation. Shortly after his break up with Cassie, Diddy lost the mother of his children Kim Porter to pneumonia. In her honour, Diddy hosted hundreds of guests at his Bel-Air home yesterday, November 18 and the event was filled with friends, family and stories about Porter’s life. Stars like French Montana, Mary J. Blige and Pharrell were among the guests who came to honour the late model who was found dead in her Toluca Lake home on Thursday, November 15. It would be recalled that after Cassie began dating Fine, there were allegations that she cheated on Diddy with Fine who was reportedly hired to be her trainer but she fell in love with him instead. Cassie was, however, quick to shut this down saying the timeline is all wrong and that she didn’t begin a romantic relationship with Fine until she and Diddy were over.
