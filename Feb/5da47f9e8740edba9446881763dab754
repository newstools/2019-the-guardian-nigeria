We all love a good love story as the concept of happily ever after is one that many of us spend hours on end dreaming about. While for some, the concept of love is an aspirational dream, media personality, IK Osakioduwa and his lovely wife, Olohije Osakioduwa are already living the dream. As Guardian Life sits with them to share in their over a decade journey of love and friendship, they share insights and give glimpses into what their love story is. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-853407 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Guardian-Val8972-1-e1549703506749.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1920" /> From being just friends for three years to pursuing a romantic interest, IK talks about how it began saying, “She was distracted by a few unnecessary boys at the time. She was dating the last guy, the one I scattered before I proposed. It wasn’t an actual proposal, I remember I called you and asked you for your genotype, your blood group before saying you and I have been friends for a long time and I would like to explore the concept of being friends forever with you. We may end up getting married or not but when you are done with him, holla at your boy.” This was the beginning of a new chapter in their life as a month later, Olo ended her then relationship with another love interest to explore what IK has on offer. This Sunday’s issue of Guardian Life Magazine details how they resolve the conflicts in their marriage, juggling a work-life balance, their projections for a continued future as well as advice for couples and intending couples who hope to have a strong and lasting marriage or relationship like theirs.
