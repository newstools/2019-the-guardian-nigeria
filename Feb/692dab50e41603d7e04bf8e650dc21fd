Twitter has been sued by a Canadian Blogger who claims that they have no right to ban her permanently after she tweeted about the transgender community. Meghan Murphy, the founder of the blog Feminist Current, wrote in her lawsuit that Twitter locked her account after she tweeted,
“Men aren’t women” because that was not their gender when they were born. “How are transwomen not men?

Their basis is that she violated their rules against hateful conduct, a decision that was introduced last year. According to Twitter, referring to transgender incorrectly is called “misgendering” and those who refer to them by their birth gender is “deadnaming.” Murphy, who filed the lawsuit on Monday in the Superior Court of California, argues that Twitter which preaches free expression engaged in “false and deceptive advertising.” Meanwhile, Twitter has called the lawsuit “meritless” and it “will vigorously defend itself against this suit.”
