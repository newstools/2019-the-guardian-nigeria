Osinbajo made the plea during a town hall meeting he held with the Hausa communities that were drawn across the Southwest geopolitical zone in Lagos. He said former leaders of the country are not in tune with the incumbent president because of his hard stand against corruption. He said what is expected to happen on Saturday is the affirmation of the support for a man who has proven through the years to be a man of truth and honesty. According to him, “The problem of our country is not that we don’t have enough money. The problem is that of leaders that we put there; many of them stole the money meant for the people. “We are able to do more than previous administrations that had access to more funds than us because Buhari is not corrupt. Even his worst enemies, those who hate him, know that he is a man of truth. They know he is a man who will not steal the money of the people.” He also said it was unfortunate that the country has become a place where people in government think it is their right to appropriate Nigeria’s money for personal use and their friends, adding, “But the stealing ended when Buhari became president. Our government has achieved a lot with meager revenues.” Osinbajo said public funds should be used for infrastructure like roads, power, schools, hospitals, which are what Buhari is committed but some corrupt people did not like. He added: “Let us not have any doubt in our minds; the battle for power in this country is the battle between good and evil. There are some people who want to take the money out of the country; there are some who want to use it for good. This is not a religious matter; you find corrupt people among the Christians, Muslims and likewise honest men in the two religions. I know one Muslim, who is an honest man. I know many, but one is Muhammadu Buhari. He is an honest man. Everybody, even his enemies, knows he is an honest man. “Let us not doubt in our mind at all; this Next Level that we are talking about, by the Grace of God, the people of this country will begin to enjoy the fruits of all the sacrifice they have made in the last four years.” The vice president explained that Buhari used his first tenure to build Nigeria’s foundation, saying that remarkable achievements had been made in railway, power, road, and other infrastructure. Osinbajo recalled that Buhari’s achievements as a former Head of State and petroleum minister were still there for all to see, saying, three of the four nation’s refineries were built by Buhari with 3500 k/m of pipelines. “This kind of man deserves a second term. If he leads this country for another four years, this country will change completely. It will be impossible for thieves to come back to this country. “This election is about the future of the country, it about the future of our own children and our own future. We must not allow anybody to do anything that will upset where our country is going. “Buhari has done a term now by May it will be four years; In another four years I promise you by the Grace of God, this country will be a different place, it will be a country that all of us will be proud of,” he said. The vice president, who said that he didn’t doubt the sincerity of the Hausa leaders to vote, charged them to mobilise their people to come out en mass to vote. In his welcome address, Alhaji Ahmed Kabiru, the Chairman, Arewa Community in Lagos State, who commended Osinbajo for recognition of Hausa community, said that Buhari remained a sellable product. “The principal thing I am selling is President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. I have to sell it to this audience. “On behalf of the entire Arewa community across the nooks and crannies of the South West Nigeria, I want to re-assure you of our support, our unflinching support for APC. “We are going to vote APC from the very top to the lowest position. I assure you, we are going to do this,” he said. He said that the group had been significant during elections and had been contributing to the success and development of APC in the state, urging Osinbajo not to forget the Arewa community. Alhaji Sadiq Babangida, Seriki Hausa, Akure, Ondo State said that the Hausa community would not change its decision to support APC, saying the country needed honest and sincere leaders.
