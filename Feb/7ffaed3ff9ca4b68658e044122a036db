We earlier reported that celebrity couple, Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin are the cover stars for the latest issue of Vogue Magazine. In the issue, they talk about their lowkey marriage, love life as well as the decision to abstain from sex until marriage. In a new clip from the interview that has emerged, 22-year-old Baldwin has described getting engaged to Bieber as the “biggest surprise” she has ever had. The model opened up about the couple’s relationship during a “73 Questions” session with Vogue just before her cover shoot. She confirmed the pop star had asked her dad before popping the question. “We were on a trip to the Bahamas and we were alone in a house, just the two of us. It was very special,” Baldwin said of the proposal. Hailey didn’t say much about the couple’s upcoming wedding ceremony but did mention her dress will be an “off white colour.” Watch the video below:
