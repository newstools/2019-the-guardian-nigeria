According to a report by Barbados Today, Rihanna’s brother, Rorrey Fenty assaulted two people in their country, Barbados. It is gathered that he was arrested for assaulting a man and a woman in an incident that took place on January 20. The victims identified as Lee-Ann Lingo and Thomton were assaulted in different incidents. The music star’s brother is reported to have first assaulted Lingo while on a party boat called the M.V Dream Chaser. Later that same day, he was accused of assaulting Thomton before he was charged with causing bodily harm. The report further went on to state that Rorrey appeared in court but pleaded not guilty to the charges and he was granted $1,000 bail. He is scheduled to appear in court again for his next hearing on June 6. As of the time of filing this report, Rihanna is yet to make a statement about the alleged assault although there are talks that the singer has wrapped up work on her forthcoming ninth studio album. It would be recalled that Rihanna was the victim of assault herself back in 2009 when her ex-boyfriend, Chris Brown beat her up. Brown was later arrested and charged and the accident has adversely affected Brown’s career till date.
