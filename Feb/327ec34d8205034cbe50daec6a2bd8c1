It has been two years since Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie broke up and ever since, the former lovebirds haven’t been spotted together. For the first time since their split, the duo has been photographed in the midst of a Beverly Hills meeting. It is gathered that the duo met on January 30, for a three-hour meeting reportedly involving custody of their six kids. The photographs were obtained by WHO magazine and show them side by side at an office in Beverly Hills. It is also reported that they were joined by legal representatives for the meeting. According to the celebrity gossip site, The Blast, things got heated between them during the meeting. Brad was reportedly pacing back and forth outside the office, while Angelina was “visibly upset”. The site reports that Brad and Angelina’s “tense” meeting was meant to further hash out details of their custody agreement. It would be recalled that following their split in 2016, Jolie had primary custody of the children but in 2018, a judge ordered Pitt to be allowed more time with the children, since not spending time with him would be “harmful” to them. Currently, the pair has a temporary agreement set in place, but they are working toward a permanent situation.  There were earlier reports that Pitt is dating actress, Charlize Theron.
