Nigeria’s People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has sued the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) over the use of card readers for the 2019 general election. The party asked a federal high court in Abuja the court to restrict INEC from postponing elections in any polling unit as a result of a malfunctioning card reader. According to the electoral body, should there be any case of card reader malfunctions, voting will be suspended till a new card reader arrives or postponed till the next day if a replacement is not available by 2 pm. The country’s presidential and National Assembly poll is scheduled for February 16. In the suit, the party argued that INEC’s insistence — in its regulations and guidelines for the conduct of the elections — that a voter’s identity must be confirmed by the card reader is inconsistent with provisions of the electoral act.
