Lagos State Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, at the weekend, warned state civil servants against wastage in the midst of daunting economic challenges. Represented by the Commissioner for Establishments, Training and Pensions, Dr. Benson Oke at a workshop for government officials, the governor said:  “It would be a great achievement if the Lagos State Civil Service is able to imbibe the principle of lean operation from the private sector, and apply it to the operation of the public sector. Team work and synergy hold the key to maximum and ultimate performance,” he said. Ambode also argued that there were some who underestimated the value and importance of synergy and team work, saying if properly embraced, he was confident that the Lagos State Civil Service would be re-positioned for higher effectiveness and responsibilities.
