Former Allied Congress Party of Nigeria’s presidential candidate Oby Ezekwesili is optimistic about forming a coalition that can trump both All Progressives Congress and People’s Democratic Party a week to the presidential elections. “O that the minds of our citizens would know that this is all about the Battle for the Soul of Nigeria!” Ezekwesili tweeted on Friday. “The Battle for the Soul of Nigeria is raging between the rotten Old Order of the Siamese Twins of Nigeria Politics and a New Order that shall surely come forth. It shall,” she added. Ezekwesili quit the presidential race in January, stating that she took the decision in a bid to form a stronger stand against Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari and the opposition People’s Democratic Party Presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar. The candidate of Alliance for New Nigeria Fela Durotoye has expressed his willingness to be a part of the coalition. President Buhari is seeking reelection under the ruling All Progressives Congress. Abubakar is the major challenger against the president. Abubakar was a two-term vice president under former President Olusegun Obasanjo’s administration from 1999-2007. But Ezekwesili has always referred to the duo as “Siamese twins of Nigerian politics” that need to be rejected out in the forthcoming election. Ezekwesili said she will build a viable coalition that will wrestle power from the APC/PDP binary. “I have not hesitated to offer my willingness to step down my candidacy in order to facilitate the emergence of a strong and viable alternative behind which Nigerians can line up in our collective search for a new beginning,” Ezekwesili said in January.
