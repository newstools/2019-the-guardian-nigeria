 [FILES] Federal High Court sitting in Jos on Friday declared Alhaji Hamisu Anani the duly elected candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), for the Wase Federal Constituency seat  The court, while ruling in a case brought by Anani against the PDP and Alhaji Omar Rabo, his rival in the race, who was given the ticket, declared that Anani actually won the party’s primary elections conduced in October. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports that Anani, through his counsel, Mr Badamasi Adam, had dragged the respondents before Justice Musa Haruna, on the allegations that he had been denied the ticket after polling the highest votes during the primary election. Anani claimed that he scored 56 votes against Rabo’s 34, and expressed surprise that the PDP opted to give the ticket to the loser. Justice Haruna, after examining the documents on the primary election, agreed with the appellant’s claim and faulted the decision of the party He ruled that Rabo, who scored thirty-four votes against Anani’s fifty-six, should not have been given the PDP flag. “I find it strange that someone, who scored the lesser votes in an election, was declared winner, while the man with the highest was denied his prize. “What I know about democracy is that the person with majority of the votes is the winner. What PDP did in this case was against the rule of the game. “I hereby declare Alhaji Mohammed Anani as winner of the PDP primary for Wase House of Representatives seat because he polled 56 votes above Rabo’s 34,” the judge declared.
