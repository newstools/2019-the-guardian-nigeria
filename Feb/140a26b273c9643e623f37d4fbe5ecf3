   The Majority Leader, Ahmed Lawan, had raised the point that the chamber could not continue the dayâ€™s legislative work because the constitutional quorum of one third of 109 members (37 lawmakers) was not formed.He explained that many legislators were still held back in their districts due to the delayed announcement of results by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Lawan therefore moved that the Senate should adjourn sitting till March 12 after the governorship and state assembly elections would have held.
The Minority Whip, Philip Aduda, seconded the motion and it was unanimously approved.But before throwing the question to the floor, Saraki inquired why the ad hoc committee on the National Minimum Wage Bill had not submitted its report. The Chief Whip and chair of the panel, Sola Adeyeye, attributed the challenge to low turnout of members during meetings, adding that efforts to cause the committee to go into electronic deliberation failed too.On whether the assignment could be concluded immediately after the elections, Adeyeye said he had health issues to deal with. The Osun legislator added he might travel out of the country in the near future to attend to the problem.Since the commencement of electioneering, the upper chamber of the National Assembly has suffered postponement of sittings thrice owing to lack of quorum and tight schedules.
