Nigeria National U-20 team, the Flying Eagles, yesterday booked a ticket to Poland 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup, beating a resilient Junior Mena of Niger Republic 1-0. It was their last group game, and the Nigerians smiled last with Adamu Alhassan providing the lone goal in the 73rd minutes. His free kick confused the Junior Mena’s goalkeeper, who had earlier prevented the Flying Eagles from scoring. The goal was all the seven–time African champions needed to fly to Poland.

On that same evening, Burundi rallied to a 3-3 draw against the host, Niger Republic, in a six-goal thriller.
