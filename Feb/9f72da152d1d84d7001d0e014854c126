The Independent National Electoral Commission has postponed the presidential and National Assembly elections earlier scheduled for Saturday. INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, announced this at a press briefing on Saturday morning held at the commission’s headquarters in Abuja. “Following a careful review of the implementation of its logistics and operational plan, and the determination to conduct free, fair, and credible elections, the commission came to the conclusion that proceeding with the elections as scheduled is no longer feasible,” Yakubu said. Yakubu said the Presidential and National Assembly elections, initially scheduled for Saturday, February 16, will now hold on February 23, while the governorship and state houses of assembly elections will take place on March 9. The press briefing followed a crucial meeting of the INEC boss with top officials of the commission which started late on Friday night.
