The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Gombe Office, has promised to put a machinery in motion to find solutions to the increasing cases of child labour in Gombe. New NHRC Gombe State Co-ordinator, Mr Ayuba Shamsuddeen, made this assertion on Friday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Gombe. Shamsuddeen assumed office on Feb. 12 as the head of NHRC, Gombe State Office. He said that the increasing cases of violation against children in the state would not be tolerated, adding that the only right of any child anywhere in the world that cannot be denied them was education. “The issue of making children bread winners of families will be checked. “It is the right of a child to go to school while his or her parents carter for their needs and not the other way round. “We as a commission will forthwith go tough in that regard with a view to bringing down such cases in the state. We appeal to government and individuals to empower people in the state. “I believe that when people are empowered and assisted with the needed resources to do their own businesses, their children may not be in the streets, hawking. The Gombe NHRC boss also said any human rights abuse case brought to the commission would be treated with utmost speed and caution it requires in order to cut down on the number of days victims suffer. He said a reported case will be treated with the needed speed and caution it requires. Shamsuddeen stressed that the commission would also be more thorough in their investigation, so that the commission does not end up violating the rights of reported persons in the course of resolving such issues. He emphasised that part of the solution to human right abuses lie in sensitisation and advocacy, hence, he pledged to partner with all stakeholders in the state to address cases of human rights  abuses.
