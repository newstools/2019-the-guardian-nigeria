 Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador waves to the public during a visit to the town of Acambay in the state of Mexico on January, 22, 2019. – An explosion and fire in central Mexico on the eve killed at least 93 people after hundreds converged on the site of an illegal fuel-line tap to gather gasoline amid the government crackdown on fuel theft, officials said.

The message, written on a bed sheet near the Salamanca refinery in the central state of Guanajuato, warned the leftist leader to withdraw the army and other security forces from the state. “Otherwise I am going to start killing them, along with innocent people,” said the message, signed by a group calling itself the Puro Cartel Santa Rosa de Lima. It was accompanied by what appeared to be a bomb left inside a pickup truck outside the refinery. However, officials later said the package, which had a small light and numerous white wires, was a fake. “False alarm,” Lopez Obrador said at his daily news conference. “There were no explosives in the abandoned pickup truck,” presidential spokesman Jesus Ramirez told journalists. “Obviously this is connected to the anti-fuel theft operations.” The message also called for the release of suspects recently arrested as part of the government’s crackdown. Lopez Obrador, an anti-establishment austerity crusader, famously disbanded the presidential guard when he took office. Security analysts have warned his safety could be at risk. The president’s standard response is, “The people will protect me.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
