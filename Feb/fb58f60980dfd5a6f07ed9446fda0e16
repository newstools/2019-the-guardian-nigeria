Have you collected your Permanent Voters Card (PVC)? You may want to do that quickly as ace Nigerian rapper and record producer, M.I. Abaga has decided to have free shows in Abuja and Jos and the entrance fee is free as long as you have your PVC. We learn that the shows named “2019 CBN Tour” is scheduled to hold today, February 1 at Polo Field in Jos and on Sunday, February 3, 2019, at the Abuja Central Park. “People can register and get a ticket to the show but once they have their PVCs and are registered to vote, the concert is free,” he said on Thursday. The rapper further went on to explain that the show is meant to motivate young, underprivileged Nigerian rappers and fans. “Our tagline being ‘control the economy’, the idea is that we’re in a country where we’re not given all the opportunities. So we decide to make the opportunities ourselves and control the economy. The CBN tour is meant to be a vehicle that would help young artistes come together, vibe and have a good time. It’s something we do every year.” he said. The 37-year-old rapper also urged fans never to allow anyone put them down in their struggles saying, “We have the audacity to be whoever we want to be. There is no rapper on earth I think I can’t be as good as. That’s how everybody should be. You should want to be the best of your kind. Never allow anybody to put you down. It doesn’t mean you should be proud or arrogant, you just need to be confident that, given the opportunity, you would knock it down.” As a young Nigerian rapper, I expect you to be number 1 in the game because that’s what we do as Nigerians.”
