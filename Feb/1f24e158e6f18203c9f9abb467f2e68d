 Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo  Osinbajo disclosed this during a courtesy visit to the Olota of Ota, Oba Adeyemi Obalanlege, in his palace in Ota. The vice president said the All Progressives Congress (APC) would also boost youth employment through the N-Power initiative. He also said the administration  would improve on the nation’s power supply by giving more licenses to companies to supply transformers. “We observed that since the privatisation of the power sector, most of the companies who bought  into it do not have sufficient funds to provide transformers for Nigerians,” he said. Osinbajo further said that government would intensify efforts at providing more infrastructure, including  good roads and efficient railway system. “The decay in infrastructural development can be traced to massive corruption of the past administration,” he said. He said that the country needed an honest and trustworthy leader like the president that would help the nation to attain sustainable development. In his response, Obalanlege thanked God for saving the life of the vice president in the helicopter crash on Saturday at Kabba, Kogi. Obalanlege appealed to the Federal Government to repair the Idiroko and Agbara roads  linking  Nigeria to some West African countries. “Some of the industries around Agbara axis where the Ogun government generates much of its revenue  left because of the bad roads in the area,” he said.He further appealed to the Federal Government to erect a fly-over  at Sango-Ota toll-gate. Obalanlege also urged the Federal Government  to create an Awori Traditional Council to prevent marginalisation of the Awori. He further appealed for political appointments for the Awori, expressing the belief   that some of their yearnings would be addressed through this.
