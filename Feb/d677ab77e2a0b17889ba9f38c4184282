Multiple award-winning actress Uche Jombo has disclosed that she has been a victim of sexual assault during her early days in the Nigerian movie industry, Nollywood. The respected filmmaker made this known during an interview with HipTV while speaking on the widespread allegations of sexual assault on upcoming actresses. The 39-year-old said, “I’ve been in that kind of situation twice during my starting days,” she said. “I rehearsed for almost two weeks only to come next and find that someone else was reading my role because I declined the request to ‘see me’ (for sex). I wept seriously, I was hurt but four to five years later, I made it big.” Explaining how she survived and maintained her stance at the time, Jombo said, “It is personal integrity. In my days, we move on when we’re denied opportunities for refusing to give in to s#xual demands. Sometimes, it’s your individual strength, drive and process that matters. What takes some six months to accomplish might take others six years. Are you ready to wait for your time or you just want a shortcut that leads to no long-lasting opportunity? If you want the shortcut, chances are that there are people willing to give it.” Jombo further went on to say that people who engage in such acts should be called out explaining that this would force Nollywood recruiters and opportunity givers who indulge in such acts to “be humans again”. It would be recalled that some few days ago, the “Mirage” star rained curses on pirates who upload Nollywood films to websites without the consent of the owners.
