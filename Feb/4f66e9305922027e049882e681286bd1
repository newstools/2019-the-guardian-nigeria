Canadian rapper, Drake is no doubt one of the hottest and most successful rappers of this generation. The “In My Feelings” hitmaker’s old rhyme book from when he was still an upcoming music act and relatively unknown to the world is up for sale at N11 million. The notebook is owned by the Grammy award-winning singer and he had it between 2002 and 2005. It is to be sold through the memorabilia company “Moments in Time” and they are hawking this prized treasure for a hefty price tag of $32,500. The notebook was found in a dumpster near Drake’s grandpa’s old furniture factory in Toronto, where Drake used to work. It also features his signature, so potential buyers can be assured it is legit. According to the celebrity gossip site, TMZ, this particular notebook features 20-25 pages of verses, full songs, and random musings by the music star during his “Degrassi” days. In fact, there are tons of insights into how a young Drake viewed and dealt with women in those days. See a short preview below; “Girls lie and you make it evident you affected Up north / Drake is the president I’m respected But I’m a liar due to the evidence you collected From chicks in my crew / to chicks beside you Cashiers at the drive through / them hoes lie too” It would be recalled that we reported that Drake is the second highest contender at the 2019 Grammy awards with seven nominations. He follows closely behind Kendrick Lamar who has eight nominations. The prestigious award is set to hold at the Staples Centre on February 10.
