 [FILE PHOTOS] Rochas Okorocha  In a statement on Tuesday in Owerri signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Sam Onwuemeodo, the chairman of the Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF) said he was aware of the political meetings of Uzodinma to achieve his aim. But the publicity secretary of the interim APC executive in the state, Enyinnaya Onuegbu, dismissed the allegation, stressing that Uzodinma was holding a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari as he was talking to The Guardian. The interim exco put in place by the national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, is loyal to Uzodinma. Okorocha’s statement read in part: “Chief Uzodinma and his motley supporters have openly canvassed support for Alhaji Atiku Abubakar of the PDP and the party’s candidates for the National Assembly election and have also been working secretly with PDP chieftains in the state for that purpose, claiming that he has decided to toe that line to get back at President Buhari and Governor Rochas Okorocha for their non-support of his candidature.” Meanwhile, the PDP is leaving nothing to chance for a resounding victory in the general elections, as it has redoubled efforts towards ensuring full recovery of electoral materials dispatched for the botched February 16 elections. The party, also through the Atiku/Obi Presidential Campaign Organisation in Anambra State led by Harry Oranezi, is hell-bent on ensuring that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) releases and distributes all the necessary electoral materials, including party agents’ tags, before the elections rescheduled for February 23 and March 9. Oranezi told newsmen yesterday that APC’s grand plan to rig the postponed elections failed because of tentacles spread by believers of the Atiku project and election monitoring groups, adding that “Nigerians cannot afford to suffer hardship for another four years,” hence their massive support for the Atiku/Obi ticket. Similarly, the women leader of the Atiku/Obi Presidential Campaign Organisation, Nonye Nwangwu, and spokesman of youth support groups, Obiora Anueyiagu, said the women and youths across the state had been alerted to remain vigilant to save democracy, blaming both INEC and APC for the alleged rigging plot gone awry.
