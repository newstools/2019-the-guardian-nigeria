A 34-year-old man, Fabian Morris accused of allegedly beating his colleague, one Gbenga to death is currently assisting detectives at the homicide section of the State Criminal Intelligence Investigation Department (SCIID), Panti, Yaba to unearth the mystery behind Gbenga’s death. It was gathered that Morris, an Assistant Supervisor at a factory in Oshodi on Monday, Feb. 11 got into a fight with his colleague who was later rushed to the hospital where he died the next day. According to a police source at SCIID, the factory had rules guiding entry and exit of employees and the suspect was challenged based on these rules, which led to the death of his colleague. “The suspect was challenged around 9:30pm by the deceased when he was trying to gain entrance into the factory and they got into a fight. During the fight, the deceased collapsed and was rushed to the hospital. He died the next day.” he said. Morris however told newsmen that the deceased was his friend whom they ate and played together and that he didn’t plan to kill him. “I am an assistant supervisor at the factory and I usually submit attendance before leaving the factory everyday. This particular day, the driver brought food for our employers and I quickly went out to get food so that I can eat before I leave. “When I was coming back, Gbenga refused to let me in so I decided to use the main gate, which was opened at that time. Gbenga still refused to let me in and we started dragging. He punched me but I did not punch him back. As we continued to drag, suddenly he fell and was rushed to the hospital where he died. “I regret my action. I would exercise patience next time. I didn’t mean to kill him. He is my friend. We eat and play together,” the suspect said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
