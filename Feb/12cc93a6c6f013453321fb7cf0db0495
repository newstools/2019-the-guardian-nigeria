Migos rapper Offset is set to release his solo album this month after an extensive delay. The first taste of the project which was originally supposed to drop on Offset’s birthday comes in the form of the Metro Boomin-produced track “Red Room.” The song previously arrived on streaming services late last year but was taken down shortly after without explanation. A few days later, Cardi B announced she and Offset were splitting up. Following cheating allegations. The video makes reference to the car crash the rapper got into back in May of 2018 when he wrecked his Dodge Challenger and was hospitalized with minor injuries. The visuals also depict other aspects of Offset’s life, from being a kid to his trouble with the law to finding music. The video was directed by Aisultan Seitov.
