 Deployment of police commissioners in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) may have elicited anger amongst political parties  The PDP had earlier threatened to ditch the peace accord over what it called “the plot to redeploy a former Chief Security Officer to APC leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, CP Kayode Egbetokun, as Kwara State Commissioner of Police, where he has been handed the instruction to incite the people, cause pandemonium and pave the way for outright rigging in favour of President (Muhammadu) Buhari and all other candidates on the platform of APC.” It claimed that, “this is in line with plans by the Buhari presidency and the APC to effect a mass deployment of top security officers, particularly the police, to intimidate, harass and manhandle Nigerians that will not support the self-succession bid of President Muhammadu Buhari as well as aiding APC thugs to snatch ballot boxes and orchestrate violence in the elections.” Addressing reporters yesterday in Ilorin, the state chairman of the Conference of National Political Parties (CNPP), Alhaji Adebayo Lawal, said it would be odd to post Egbetokun to a “state where Tinubu is known to have strong interest in securing political dominance.” The coalition of opposition parties recalled that the new CP had been announced as Lagos police boss at the tail of the immediate past IGP Ibrahim Idris’ administration but was reversed by his successor, Adamu Mohammed, perhaps on same ground of alleged partisanship.
