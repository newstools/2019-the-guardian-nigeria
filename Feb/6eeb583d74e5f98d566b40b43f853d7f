For some weeks now, there have been speculations that all is not well in the relationship of reality TV star, Khloe Kardashian and her baby daddy, Tristan Thompson. Kardashian has seemingly been fuelling the rumours further with cryptic posts on her Instagram page. She posted a new vague quote after Thompson was reported by “Life & Style” to have been “flirty” with other women on Valentine’s Day. The 34-year-old reported shared a photo on her Instagram page today with rapper, Big Sean lyrics from his song “Memories”. The photo was of herself in pink eyeshadow, lipstick, and draping her pajama shirt off her shoulders. The caption read, “Are you willing to give up what you love, for who you love?” It would be recalled that Kardashian spent Valentine’s day at home with their 10-month-old daughter while Thompson was out. A report by Hollywood Life had said, “Tristan arrived at Pineapple Hill Saloon And Grill in Sherman Oaks on the evening of Valentine’s Day. He was definitely without Khloe and didn’t seem to be missing her. She was nowhere in sight. Coincidentally enough, she lives close by.” Interestingly, Kardashian had posted another cryptic message on Valentine’s Day as well, which was directed about finding your “person.”
