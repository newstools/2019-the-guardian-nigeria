The ruling All Progressives Congress Wednesday got the approval of the Court of Appeal in Sokoto to field its candidates in Zamfara state. The court dismissed an appeal against the judgment of a Zamfara State High Court asking the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to recognise candidates of the APC for various offices in Zamfara State. A three-member panel of judges unanimously dismissed the appeal following its withdrawal by the appellant, Aminu Jaji. The party will now participate in all elections in the state. INEC has early insisted it would not recognise the Zamfara candidates who were produced after the stipulated time for the primaries. The electoral body also maintained its position following conflicting judgments on the matter by a high court of Zamfara and federal high court on the same day.
