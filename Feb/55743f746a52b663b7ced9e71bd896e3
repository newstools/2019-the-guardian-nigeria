Officers of the Nigeria Police Force have allegedly arrested Senator Rafiu Ibrahim, the People’s Democratic Party candidate for Kwara South Constituency ahead of Saturday’s elections. PDP Kwara South Youth Forum Chairman Muideen Abdulrahman in a statement said Ibrahim was arrested on Thursday night. “The reason behind Senator Ibrahim’s arrest is currently unknown and reminiscent of last year’s arrest of Kwara PDP leaders in Kwara South constituency during the bye-election”, he noted. Although, the police are yet to speak about the arrest, however, the arrest may be unconnected to the clash between supporters of the PDP and the All Progressives Congress in his hometown, Ojoku, on Tuesday. About two persons lost their lives while many others were injured. On Wednesday, Police said six suspects had been arrested. However, the arrest has been roundly criticized by people as it could cast a pall over the election process in the state. The arrest of Ibrahim by the Police shows that “Institutions of state are being manipulated,” said Olu Onemola, Special Assistant on New Media to Senate President Bukola Saraki said.
