The Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries Football Club (MFM FC) will today host Wikki Tourists of Bauchi in Match day six of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) fixture at the Temple Stadium in Agege. Majority of the players paraded by coach Fidelis Ilechukwu, who are new to NPFL’s top-flight football, will, however, be hoping to consolidate on their winning streak, after recording two victories against Kwara United and Rangers International of Enugu at their home ground. One of the newly recruited players, Tunde Azeez, a midfielder, who has had an assist in goal in the current season, said the Olukoya Boys would claim top spot after today’s duel against the Giant Elephants from Bauchi. “We are looking forward to the weekend clash. We have been working so hard and the intensity is high.“We are also moving on gradually and by the grace of God at the end of the weekend game I believe we will go back to the top of the table.” Speaking further, he said: “I have been enjoying myself since I joined MFM FC. I’m enjoying my game here because I have a lot of time to play. I also like the philosophy of our coach because he is free with every one of us.“I’m grateful to captain Austine Opara, who advises me most times about our games and there is no pressure on me,” the former Titan Football Academy of Lagos player disclosed.” While MFM occupy the third spot of the NPFL Group A league table with six points, Wikki Tourists are in fourth place with the same points as their hosts in today’s encounter.
