 Kate Henshaw on set  Award-winning director and writer, Ishaya Bako, directs it.According to Henshaw, “what is most significant is the message it carries; we need to stand up for the truth and fight for justice. It’s our duty.” After her campaign manager, Sikiru (Jide Attah) turns up dead, gubernatorial aspirant Mabel King played by Henshaw challenges the victory of the incumbent, Idris Sani (Sani Mu’azu), in the law court for her mandate.
