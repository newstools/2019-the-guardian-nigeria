The Nigerian Army has confirmed the arrest of six members of the Indigenous People of Biafra(IPOB) over Biafra Referendum and debunked shooting or killing anyone during the raid. An online medium had reported that soldiers of 144 Battalion on routine patrol in Aba general area of Abia State shot three persons and one of them died instantly. But the Army said the report was untrue. “The Division wishes to state that although there was an incidence involving 144 Battalion patrol team with some traders at Asa – Nnentu spare parts market in Ugwunagbo Local Government Area of Abia State, at no time was anybody shot at, wounded or killed as lopsidedly and therefore wrongly reported by the medium,” Army spokesman Sagir Musa said in a statement on Saturday. Musa said six IPOB members were arrested and handed over to the Nigerian Police Abia State Command with no one recorded shot or killed. This came a week after the pro-Biafra separatist group said it will hold a referendum in Nigeria’s Southeast on February 16, the same day Nigeria will be going to poll to elect its president. The referendum is “ascertain number of those who want Nigeria politics and those who want Biafra freedom through a peaceful and democratic process for the sovereignty of our dear nation Biafra,” IPOB spokesman, Comrade Emma Powerful said in a statement. Powerful said the leader of the separatist group Nnamdi Kanu was finalising plans for the referendum in London.
