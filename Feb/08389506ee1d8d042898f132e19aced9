They were also punished for the same reasons following their home game against Nimes on February 10, three days after Sala’s body was recovered from the wreckage of the plane. The league declined to comment when contacted by AFP. Sala had signed for Cardiff City for a club record £15 million ($19 million) last month and was flying to his new team from former side Nantes when his plane went missing on January 21.
