El Kanemi Warriors yesterday dug deep inside their armoury to beat Heartland of Owerri 2-0 in a matchday 10 Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) tie at home. The Warriors, who are currently second on the Group B table, found the Naze Millionaires a little too hot to handle in the first half, but at the end, two strikes from Ba’akaka Kolo (74th minute) and Innocent Gabriel (86th minute) gave them the three points. In Benin, Ossy Martins’ 49th minute goal put paid to Bendel Insurance’s dream of getting a home win as their game ended 1-1. Michael Ugwu had given the crowd of Insurance’s supporters hope of a home success when he opened scores in the 13th minute, but Martins had other ideas as he waited for just four minutes after the break to bring the team on even terms.
