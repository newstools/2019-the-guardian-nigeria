Coach Lucien Favre will be delighted to have his team’s leading goalscorer back for the return leg of the Champions League last-16 tie against Tottenham on March 5, although Dortmund need to overturn a 3-0 first-leg deficit to progress. Reus, who has scored 17 goals in all competitions this season, was badly missed by Dortmund as they endured a five-match winless run. But they returned to winning ways on Sunday as Jadon Sancho scored in a 3-2 victory over Bayer Leverkusen which sent them three points clear of defending champions Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga.
