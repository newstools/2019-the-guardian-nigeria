 Paris Saint-Germain’s Uruguayan forward Edinson Cavani reacts as he suffers an injury after scoring a goal during the French L1 football match between Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) and FC Girondins de Bordeaux at the Parc des Princes Stadium, in Paris, on February 9, 2019. – Edinson Cavani is likely to miss the first leg of Paris Saint-Germain’s Champions League encounter with Manchester United, coach Thomas Tuchel told French television on February 10, 2019.

PSG brushed off the absences of both Cavani and Neymar, who is sidelined with a foot injury, by beating United 2-0 in last week’s first leg at Old Trafford, with Kylian Mbappe continuing his fine run of form with a goal. But they now have a hope of seeing Cavani return in time for the second match in Paris after he managed some light individual training Tuesday. He will not be back in time to play in the rescheduled Ligue 1 game against Montpellier on Wednesday, while Thomas Meunier is also still out injured and Leandro Paredes unavailable having been signed from Zenit St Petersburg after the fixture was originally due to be played on December 8.
