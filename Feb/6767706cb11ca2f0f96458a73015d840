Over 60 children around Oworonshoki area in Lagos State at the weekend completed a basketball training clinic, as part of the Ayo Charity Foundation activities to celebrate the Valentine. The event, tagged ‘Valentine basketball programme against drug abuse’ was put together in conjunction with four three.com and Del basketball Nigeria to educate street kids in Oworonshoki to live a violence-free life if they are to be useful to their society. Speaking on the occasion, the technical director of the clinic, coach Awonuga Oladele Simon said apart from the Valentine programme, the basketball foundation always hold a special basketball clinic every three months to help keep the children out of the streets. “The basketball foundation is to help monitor the progress of the children in schools. Our relationship with parents gives us the privilege to get feedback on the children in terms of their behaviour. We don’t allow any child that does not do well in school and in their homes take active part in the clinic. “Apart from basketball, we also create a platform to have a good working relationship with the children’s parents and teachers. The foundation is not interested in taking any child abroad to play basketball, but we allow international organisations that want to give the children scholarships in sports or education come to the camp and monitor the children and youths. “Our goal is to raise talents in basketball and also build a society that has reliable children that will move the nation forward in future,” he said.
