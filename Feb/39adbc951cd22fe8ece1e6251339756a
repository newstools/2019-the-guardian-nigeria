“Legbegbe” hitmaker, Mr Real is finally blessing fans with new music. The singer who has not released any official single since the release of “Legegbe” appears to have been taking his time to work on his new music which is titled, “Antidote”. The song is fitting for the feeling of love that is in the air thanks to Valentine’s day celebration. The song is a fresh sound of its own as it did not try to build on the fundamentals of the highly-successful “Legbegbe”, instead, it follows its own unique direction. Watch the video of “Antidote” below:
