 President Muhammadu Buhari (middle); Emir of Ilorin and Chairman, Kwara State Traditional Council, Alhaji Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari; All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq; Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed (fourth left), and others during a presidential rally in Ilorin… yesterday.  Buhari said while he and his party promised an improved economy during his 2015 campaigns, the country has also achieved food security as a way of safeguarding the country’s economy.He explained that the people of the Northeast could testify to the achievement of the administration on security, where the Boko Harram insurgency has been abysmally reduced. The president said the administration was on course in the fight against corruption, and would not give up on the fight.“We have achieved food security, people are now living well, and we will not stop the fight against corruption. We will continue to invest the money collected from looters in infrastructure development,” he said. Buhari expressed delight at the massive number of people who thronged the Ilorin Metropolitan Square, venue of the campaign rally.Although the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state is polarised, Buhari broke the jinx of the dichotomy when he raised the hand of AbdulRahaman AbdulRasak as the governorship candidate of the party in the forthcoming elections. The development, unless over turned by judicial decisions, has put paid to the claims by the other faction that Kayode Omotoshe was the governorship candidate of the party in the state.National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole, said Buhari was putting back to the track the displaced essence of governance in the country. He said the security and welfare of the masses remained the essence of governance, adding that the PDP had displaced the essence by empowering the rich at the expense of the poor masses.Earlier, at the palace of the Emir of Ilorin, Sulu-Gambarim, the Emir commended Buhari for engaging in a peaceful campaign, as well as embarking on infrastructure development across the country.
