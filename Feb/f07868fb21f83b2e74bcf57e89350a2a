 Okocha  In 2015, Okocha emerged as DFA chairman following a landslide victory in the board election, where he defeated former Tolopia FC boss, Evans Egbo. But the former Super Eagles playmaker (Okocha) later handed over to his deputy, Edema Fuludu, due to his inability to combine his ‘busy schedule’ in Lagos with the DFA job. The decision by Fuludu, who had been functioning as DFA acting chairman, to go for the chairmanship position in the coming board election has pitched him against another board member, Victor Ikpeba. The Guardian learnt yesterday that in a bid to boost his chairmanship campaign, one of the candidates decided to lure Okocha to his side, but his effort has not yielded the needed result. A source hinted that the candidate wants Okocha at all cost to call a Congress of DFA, where the date and venue for the coming election will be decided. “The candidate is very desperate in becoming the next chairman of the DFA. He has been searching for Okocha all over the country to call for a Congress of the DFA because the NFF has made it clear that it will only recognize a Congress that is called by either Jay Jay Okocha or Edema Fuludu.” The Guardian learnt yesterday that the tenure of the current DFA board will officially ends tomorrow. Another source hinted yesterday that a DFA Congress called by Edema Fuludu would hold today in Agbarho, near Warri. Some stakeholders see Fuludu as preferred candidate for the DFA chairmanship position. To them, picking Lagos-based Ikpeba would amount to repeating the mistake of the past after Okocha allegedly abandoned the DFA job due to his ‘busy schedule’ in Lagos. An alleged plan by the Delta Sports Commission chairman, Tony Okowa to ‘impose’ Ikpeba as the DFA chairman was rebuffed by the NFF last week.
