 Managing director Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), Capt. Fola Akinkuotu  Speaking on behalf of the non-scheduled operators, the Managing Director of Sunrise International Air Support Ltd., Sunny Ebisue, expressed gratitude to NAMA for organising such a forum. Ebisue, however, called on the agency to sustain such interaction with operators in order to keep them abreast of new developments. As part of the resolutions reached at the end of the meeting, operators or their representatives are to each open and fund a domiciliary account with which to effect all financial transactions with NAMA, through monetary transfers to the agency’s sub-account with the CBN using a smart phone.
  
On the other hand, a representative can open a domiciliary account, transfer an amount of foreign currency in advance into NAMA account at CBN to enable the agency debit that balance anytime the operator needs the agency’s services.
