Hollywood actor and singer, Jussie Smollett has taken to the stage to perform for the first time following the alleged homophobic and racist attack on him as earlier reported. The “Empire” star who was alleged to have been attacked by two men in Chicago last Tuesday remained undeterred as he took to the stage last night at a Southern California concert. Addressing the crowd before singing, he said he had to go on with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win. He said; “I had to be here tonight. I couldn’t let these motherf*****s win. And above all, I fought the fuck back,” he said to cheers. Then he paused and said, emphatically but with a laugh: “I’m the gay Tupac.” As earlier reported, the screen star told police that the two men who attacked him made reference to “MAGA” (Make America Great Again). The slogan was used by Donald Trump during the 2016 US presidential campaign. The Chicago police are currently investigating whether he was the victim of a hate crime.
