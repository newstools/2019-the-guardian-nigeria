Arik Air on Friday said the patronage of its “Fly-to-Vote promo’’ by Nigerians, ahead of Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly Elections, was encouraging.The spokesperson for Arik Air, Mr Adebanji Ola, made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. NAN reports that the airline had said that the N16, 000 fly-to-vote promotion was to encourage Nigerians to travel to their respective wards to cast their votes during the elections. The airline said the promo was available for sale from Feb. 18 till March 11, for travel between Feb. 21 and Feb. 26, as well as March 7 till March 12. According to the airline, a customer must, however, present a valid Permanent Voters’ Card (PVC) at the point of purchase and at check-in, to be eligible to fly. Ola told NAN that some Nigerians had taken advantage of the slashing of the air fare to participate in exercising their civic responsibilities. “The patronage has been encouraging. People have been buying tickets to go back to their respective wards, in order to participate in the elections. “The procedure remains that such passengers present their PVCs and the N16, 000 covers all our 17 domestic routes. “We have put this promotional fare in place to enhance voters’ participation in the elections,’’ he said. However, a NAN correspondent who monitored the situation on Friday at the General Aviation Terminal of the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos, observed that majority of the promo beneficiaries flew with Arik Air’s morning flights to their respective destinations. Some travellers who attempted to purchase the promotional tickets off the airline’s counter for immediate travelling were turned back by the staffers, despite producing their PVCs. A travel agent, Mr Uche Ikeagwu, told NAN that the promo flights for the Presidential and National Assembly elections had been fully booked. “I learnt those who travelled today already booked their flights since Monday. I was trying to assist a friend but unfortunately, we were told that it was no longer available, so we have to consider other options,’’ he said.
