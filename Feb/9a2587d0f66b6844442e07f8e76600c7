Award-winning singer, songwriter Bebe Rexha is back with her first song of 2019 titled “Last Hurrah” The artist said the track was inspired by a friend who couldn’t resist one last indulgence.
“She was supposed to be on a diet and she ate a piece of chocolate cake and her husband was like, ‘aren’t you supposed to be on a diet?’” Bebe explained on Twitter. “She responded to him by saying, ‘babe this is my last hurrah.’ Meaning like it’s gonna be one more night of me messing up.” The song is Bebe’s first solo single since 2018’s “I’m a Mess,” which appeared on her debut studio album Expectations. The project helped her earn a Best New Artist nomination at the 2019 Grammys. The track was produced by the ever versatile Andrew Wells.
