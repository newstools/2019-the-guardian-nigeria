Avril Lavigne has released new music but that is not the only exciting news of all, she enlisted the help of rap hotshot, Nicki Minaj! The two powerful musicians released the joint song titled, “Dumb Blonde” today, February 12 and as expected fans are freaking out about it. On the track, both stars prove to be total girl bosses as they drop lyrics that are feminist leaning. Lavigne’s new song with Minaj is expected to be one of the tracks on her new album that is set to drop on Friday, February 15. The album, “Head Above Water” is Lavigne’s first release since 2013. Avril let fans in on the concept behind the new track via her Instagram page. She wrote, “The concept and idea for #DumbBlonde came to me through a situation I experienced and I brought it to @BonnieMcKee and #MitchAllan, who helped me bring it to life. I had this fu**ing loser in my life who was threatened by my strength, confidence and independence as a woman. I was belittled and made to feel bad for who I was: A leader, someone with a vision and opinions, someone who has strength, desire, passion and goals. Never let anyone put you down for being who you are. Stand up. Fight. Be you. Love. Be genuine. Kind.” Lavigne also tweeted ahead of the drop. “@NickiMinaj is my favourite!!! I’ve been listening to her for so long, As soon as I recorded #DumbBlonde, I knew she’d be the perfect artist to collaborate with on it. When she said yes it was like a dream come true!!!” Minaj also revealed that she is a longtime fan of Avril’s music. “I used to drive to my job [at] Red Lobster playing this woman’s album for an hour straight everyday for months,” Minaj tweeted. “Crying to “I’m with you”, blasting “complicated” “things I’ll never say” “nobody’s fool” “sk8er boi”. omg. #DumbBlonde tmrw. This woman is so unbelievably talented.” Listen to the new song below:
