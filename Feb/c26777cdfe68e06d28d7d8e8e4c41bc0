Jussie Smollett denies playing a role in his attack, according to a statement from his attorneys.
Smollett’s attorneys Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson released a statement regarding the recent reports about his potential participation in the attack. It began,
“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.” Their note continued, “One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity. Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.” The Chicago Police Department’s Chief Communications Officer confirms the case has taken a turn based on details provided by the brothers, saying; “The information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has, in fact, shifted the trajectory of the investigation.” He adds that police have reached out to Jussie’s attorney to request a follow-up interview and possible questioning.
