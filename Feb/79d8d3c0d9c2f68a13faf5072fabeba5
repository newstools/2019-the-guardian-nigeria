Ibrahim said the difficult terrains were villages located in Yamaltu-Deba and Shingom Local Government Areas of the state. “We will hire donkeys, bicycles and motorcycles to distribute election materials. “This is because some of the areas lack access routes and INEC has made adequate arrangements in the area of logistics as well as other areas,’’ he said. Ibrahim said the commission had made adequate arrangements in terms of security and conducted massive voter education. He noted that there was provision for brail ballot papers for the blind and the lepers could use their legs to vote. Ibrahim said INEC also made provision for a magnifier for those that have a problem with their sight. He also said the commission mounted tracking system and monitors for the election process.
