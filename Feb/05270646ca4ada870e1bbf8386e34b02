As the 2019 presidential elections hold today, February 23, Nigerians are to chose whether they want to remain in their current state or move higher. Gathering in their numbers at different polling units, they will decide who will become Nigeria’s president for the next four years. Here are some of the conspiracy theories that shook the candidates and the nation: Read More: The Polls Of Our Lives Jibril from Sudan President Buhari’s body double is Jibril Aminu from Sudan. This story was propagated by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) leader, Nnamdi Kanu. Kanu alleged that during one of president Muhammadu Buhari’s numerous medical trips to London, he kicked the bucket. To stop the citizens from finding out, Nigerian diplomat, Habibi Almu who was killed in Sudan, sought for a doppelganger for the president. To prove that Kanu was speaking the truth, he told Nigerians to observe the difference in the ear, broad nose bridge and the teen-like hands of Jibril and Buhari. Read More: Nigerians React To Buhari’s Clone MrAyeDee (real name Mukhtar Alexander Dan’Iyan), on February 2, 2019, called on the government to shut down the internet. The US-based supporter opined that this will help reduce the spread of fake results. He wrote, The internet will be shut down by 11:59 PM on Friday, Feb. 15th, 2019 and restored by 11:59 pm on Saturday, February 16th, 2019. If this is not done, there will be chaos as fake results are bound to be brandished by both @OfficialAPCNg and @OfficialPDPNig, causing chaos. In this crucial election, Nigerian cannot afford to have the electorate manipulated by rumours and propaganda emanating from both major parties. Therefore, it makes sense to ensure the sanctity of the electoral process by restricting access to the internet. Bangladesh with a population of 160 million + shut down its internet before its elections, heaven did not fall, the poll was orderly, free and fair. Nigeria deserves same. I did not say the internet should be restricted for just PDP supporters or just for APC supporters, I said it should be restricted for ALL Nigerians. 11 days after this outrageous request, our “investigative” IT governor. Peter Fayose of Ekiti state, announced on his Twitter that indeed plans were underway. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-865097 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fayose.png" alt="" width="1280" height="706" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fayose.png 575w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fayose-487x268.png 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fayose-320x176.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />
Despite the government’s denial of the attempt, some insist that the internet was shut down on the previous election day February 16 because they experienced network issues for a moment. This theory is older than the infamous Jibril. Before the 2015 elections, prophecies, predictions as well as rumours to Islamise Nigeria under the Buhari administration gained prominence. To prove their suspicions correct, Buhari has been strategically removing non-Northerners to and replacing them with Northerners some of who have corruption cases before the court and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). This action undertaken by the administration has only made people believe that Nnamdi Kanu holds the key to Nigeria’s unknown secrets”). However, until election day, February 23, Buhari still insists that he has no plans to Islamise the country! Peter Obi is in the bad books of Northerners. This is because of the viral WhatsApp story on how he is responsible for the death of Alhaji Ahmadu Bello, the Sardauna of Sokoto when he was just five years old. In fact, the story written in Hausa goes that he was the one who told the Military the best way to the Sardauna. Someone should please help me ask PDP why Peter Obi did not attend most of their campaigns in the North?? It’s because they don’t want the Northerners to remember his atrocities against them when he was governor!! He made Northerners wear special identity cards!! — Nwachukwu Emeka (@nwachukwum) February 19, 2019 To make the matter worse, the message opines that why he did not appear in political campaigns in the North. What the Whatsapp story left out, is that he pulled a surprise visit to a market in Northcentral. A few days to the election, people who claimed to have reliable information announced that INEC had suddenly charged people to vote with their index finger rather than the thumb.  INEC, the accused had this to say: <img class="aligncenter wp-image-865096 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/iNDEX-FINGER.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="914" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/iNDEX-FINGER.jpg 1080w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/iNDEX-FINGER-838x598.jpg 838w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/iNDEX-FINGER-487x348.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/iNDEX-FINGER-974x695.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/iNDEX-FINGER-320x228.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/iNDEX-FINGER-640x457.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/iNDEX-FINGER-600x428.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />
