Nigeria’s ruling All Progressives Congress National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, Monday was booed and stoned at the party’s presidential campaign rally Ogun State. Oshiomhole was pelted with different objects by some of the people present at the rally when he mentioned the name of the party’s governorship candidate in the state, Dapo Abiodun while addressing the crowd. It took the intervention of the incumbent state governor Ibikunle Amosun to pacify the irate crowd. He pleaded with them to respect the presence of President Muhammadu Buhari The Ogun State APC gubernatorial primaries were marred with controversies with Amosun seeking to install his successor but the national headquarters opted for another candidate from a congress conducted by the National Working Committee. Amosun openly supports Adekunle Akinlade of Allied Peoples Movement (APM) for the gubernatorial elections in Ogun State while APC have Dapo Abiodun on their ballot. Akinlade was declared the winner in a controversial governorship primary conducted by the Ogun APC chapter backed by Amosun. However, the national headquarters of the APC rejected that primary and accepted the primary conducted by a committee sent by the headquarters to Ogun State. The latter primary produced Abiodun as APC governorship candidate. This caused a bitter rivalry between Amosun and Oshiomhole. Amosun is one of the three governors believed to be demanding the exit of Mr Oshiomhole as party chairman. The Ogun State Governor is running for Senate on the platform of the APC.
