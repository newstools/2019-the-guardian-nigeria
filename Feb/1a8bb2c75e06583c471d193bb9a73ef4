I hope to receive a positive response,” he said. Maduro is supporting plans for a meeting of Latin American and European Union states in “Contact Group” talks in Montevideo on Thursday. The pope is currently on a visit to the United Arab Emirates and is due to return to Rome on Tuesday. Under Maduro’s stewardship, oil-dependent Venezuela has plunged into an economic crisis, suffering from hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine. After several years of opposition efforts to oust Maduro, Guaido declared himself acting president at a rally on January 23.
