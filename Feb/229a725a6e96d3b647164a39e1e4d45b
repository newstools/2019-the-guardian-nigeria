According to multiple reports, singer-actress Lady Gaga and her talent agent fiancé, Christian Carino have broken up. The news of their split was confirmed by a representative of the Grammy award-winning Gaga to The Associated Press. As of the time of filing this report, no more details were provided as to why the spit. The breakup got noticed when the “Shallow” hitmaker failed to take Carino along with her to the 2019 Grammy Awards. She was also without her engagement ring at the event. While receiving the award for Best Duo or a Group, Gaga failed to include him in the list of people she thanked. Carino’s failure to attend the event alongside Gaga was unusual since fans were used to him being by her side at award events she has attended this season. Further fuelling the spit rumours was that on Valentine’s day, Gaga failed to post pictures of Carino. Instead, she shared a picture of her tattooed spine (a rose that begins at the back of her neck and stretches down her spine, along with the words “la vie en rose.”) and wrote, “Happy Valentine’s Day. A tattoo toast to ‘la vie en rose’ by the beautiful @winterstone my spinal cord is now a rose.”  The new ink memorialises the famous French ballad that brought her and her “A Star Is Born” co-star and director, Bradley Cooper together on the big screen. Prior to dating and splitting from Carino,  Gaga was engaged to actor, Taylor Kinney.
