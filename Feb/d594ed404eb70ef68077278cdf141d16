He also chose the perfect position to run for. Prestigious enough to gain attention,small enough to campaign impactfully. And he had years preselling himself.But most importantly,he worked very hard to get turnout ‚Äî Babanla (@biolakazeem) February 23, 2019  Banky w ! I am proud to know you sir ‚Äî Davido (@iam_Davido) February 23, 2019  Banky W suddenly has your support now?  Lol In everything you do,  believe in yourself and don't listen to naysayers‚Ä¶ They will celebrate you with the same mouth‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Olashile Abayomi (@FireOFola) February 23, 2019  ‚ÄúGorimapa Chris Brown‚Äù‚ÄúBanky is a lightweight‚Äù‚ÄúHe is just wasting his time‚Äù I guess the results coming in so far for BankyW and how keenly contested his constituency looks because of his courage to run has now confirmed how many of you are actually mere ignorant loudmouths. ‚Äî OurFavOnlineDoctor ü•≥ (@DrOlufunmilayo) February 23, 2019  You see what Banky has done. Focusing on a small niche he knows he can impact and make a difference. That is what other small parties need to do and stop all this motivational talk. ‚Äî Oluwaseun Adebayo (@the_adebayoseun) February 23, 2019  Failure is an orphan. Suddenly Banky W is on everyone‚Äôs lips ‚Äî Dr. D√≠p√≤ | The Career (@OgbeniDipo) February 23, 2019  Banky W is a leader abeg. In a few months, he was able to get party agents across his Consistency in a newly registered party with logo identification challenges. Great effort! ‚Äî ‚ÄòKayode Adegbola (@kayodea) February 23, 2019  Banky W‚Äôs win would really be a game changer for the youths who are actually interested in serving. Would be glad if he wins eventually. ‚Äî Wale Adetona (@iSlimfit) February 23, 2019  Some have exercised skepticism: I hope Banky W and Akin Alabi both win, let‚Äôs see what the yute can do..
