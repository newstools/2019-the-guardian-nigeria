Barely 24 hours after the endorsement of Atiku Abubakar for presidency by the Northern Elders’ Forum (NEF), the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) yesterday acommended President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration for the commencement of oil drilling in the North. ACF lauded the President’s initiative 24 hours after the Professor Ango Abdullahi led-NEF endorsed Atiku for the presidency. The forum described oil and gas drilling operations in the Spud-In of Kolmani River-11 well in the Gongola Basin in Bauchi State as a welcome development. In a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Muhammad Ibrahim Biu, ACF noted that the oil and gas exploration would add value to the nation’s economy. “Government’s demonstration of the political will to aggressively pursue oil exploration in the Northern part of the country clearly dovetails with its economic recovery and growth plan, which could boost economic benefits, particularly in the North and entire country,” it stated. The ACF, therefore, commended the Federal Government and urged it to sustain oil and gas exploration efforts in the other frontier basins. “In this respect, ACF appeals to the Nigeria National Petroleum Company (NNPC) to ensure that the Presidential directive on the oil exploration campaigns in Chad Basin, Gongola, Anambra, Sokoto, Bida Basins and Benue Trough are carried out to the letter and spirit,” it added.
