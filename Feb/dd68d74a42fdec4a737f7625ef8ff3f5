Ahead of the 2019 general elections, Director-General, National Broadcasting Commission, Mallam Is’haq Modibo Kawu has stressed the need for broadcaster stations to refrain from broadcasting hate speech and inciting comments. He, however, urged them to exhibit unwavering professionalism in the discharge of their duties. While speaking at a two-day workshop on ‘Political Broadcast’ in Lagos last week, he insisted that if broadcasters could exhibit professionalism, it would ensure consolidation of democracy, adding that the role of the media is central to the success of democracy. According to him, the broadcaster is always on trial, adding that broadcast stations should also engage veterans to assist in training and mentoring upcoming broadcasters in order to prevent experiential gap. With the theme: ‘The Media Coverage of 2015 Elections: Challenges, Regulatory Framework and the Way Forward for a Credible 2019 Elections,’ stakeholders in a communique after the workshop unanimously agreed that there is need for regulation, and enjoined NBC to engage broadcast owners on the need to allow broadcasters carry out their roles professionally. Stakeholders also noted that all stories must be fact-checked before going to press and all political adverts must be vetted by Advertising Standards Panel. They also expressed concern over the collapse of gatekeeping process in journalism, and urged editors to be ethical, avoid partisanship and give fair hearing to all parties, adding that political broadcasts must be in decent language. Former Director-General of NBC, Mallam Danladi Bako, advocated ethical reorientation for journalists, adding that election results must be verified before going to press.
