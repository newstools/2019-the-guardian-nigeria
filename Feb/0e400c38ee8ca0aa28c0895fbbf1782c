Globacom’s Deputy Chief Operating Officer, Technical, Bisi Koleoso, said: “We have invested massively in new technologies to introduce these products which we believe will redefine business, social and personal pursuits.” The company said the AI platform would engage customers directly and assist them to get information on pressing issues.
