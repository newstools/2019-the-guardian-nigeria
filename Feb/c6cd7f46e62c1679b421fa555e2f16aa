 The White House is seen as snow falls in Washington, DC, on February 1, 2019. – Brutally cold temperatures gripped the US Midwest on Januarty 31, freezing water mains, causing power outages, canceling flights and straining natural gas supplies. More than a dozen deaths have been attributed to the sub-zero weather and a weekend snowstorm that blanketed the same region. Many of the cold-related fatalities were in Michigan, where the governor said the death toll was still being confirmed.

Most days, Trump has no official work before 11:00 am, according to the daily guidance given to the media by the press office. That usually begins with the president receiving his intelligence briefing. According to detailed private schedules published by Axios, things don’t get much more hectic after that. Sixty percent of the president’s work life is categorized as “executive time,” meaning unstructured time to make phone calls, read newspapers, tweet and watch television. Trump’s personal secretary, Madeleine Westerhout, was not amused by the embarrassing report. “What a disgraceful breach of trust to leak schedules,” she tweeted, adding that the leaked documents in Axios don’t show “the hundreds of calls and meetings @realDonaldTrump takes everyday.” “This POTUS is working harder for the American people than anyone in recent history,” she tweeted. Monday’s official schedule, released by the press office, indicated business as usual. Trump, who spent the weekend at his Florida golf club, was due to have his intelligence briefing at 11:45, followed by lunch with Vice President Mike Pence at 12:45.
