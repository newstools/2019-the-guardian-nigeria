The Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) has alleged that Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari plans to order the arrest of a commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Okechukwu Ibeanu. Ibeanu is INEC’s commissioner in charge of operations. CUPP alleges that Ibeanu refused to help Buhari sabotage the election process. “The refusal of INEC to proceed with staggered election during the aborted February 16 election which ruined Buhari APC rigging plan is the reason for the new offensive against INEC to intimidate them into submission,” CUPP spokesman Imo Ugochinyere said in a statement. Ugochinyere disclosed that a former director-general of the Department of State Services (DSS) was still in control of the government’s secret agency. Although the CUPP spokesman did not mention the name of the DSS director-general but said the current head of the agency Yusuf Bichi is acting in representation of another principal. “The former DG convinced Buhari to allow the use of the DSS to clampdown on INEC to force them to do their bidding or sabotage the rescheduled election and stop it from holding. Ugochinyere appealed to Nigerians to support the CUPP and “rise up against this ongoing leadership abuse and madness which have the potentiality to throw Nigeria into electoral violence that will enable Buhari to execute his lawless order.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
