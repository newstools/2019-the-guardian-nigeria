Childish Gambino on Sunday took home the Grammy for Song of the Year — honouring best songwriting for his politically charged “This Is America,” whose graphic music video carried a strong message on gun violence and racism. The trap gospel song packed with social commentary nabbed one of the top awards of the night over heavyweights Drake, Kendrick Lamar and Lady Gaga. The song’s striking video from Childish Gambino — the alter ego of actor and recording artist Donald Glover, who has snagged three Grammys so far — racked up more than 35 million YouTube views in just two days last spring. Earlier Sunday, he won the Grammy for Best Music Video.
