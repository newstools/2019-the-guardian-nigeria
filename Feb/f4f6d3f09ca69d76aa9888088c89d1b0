Should British GDP come in at 1.2 percent, it will be the country’s weakest output in a decade. The BoE had in November forecast 2019 growth of 1.7 percent. “Brexit uncertainties had intensified considerably since the Committee’s November meeting,” the BoE said Thursday. “The economic outlook will continue to depend significantly on the nature of EU withdrawal,” it added. EU leaders host British Prime Minister Theresa May for talks in Brussels on Thursday as the two sides seek to save their Brexit deal. Plans for Britain to leave the European Union on March 29 under a withdrawal agreement signed last year were thrown into doubt when British lawmakers rejected the accord. In London on Thursday, the BoE also slashed its forecast for 2020 UK growth — to 1.5 percent from 1.7 percent. The downgrades sent the pound sinking under $1.29, while the euro rebounded close to 88 pence. “The pound has dropped to its lowest (dollar) level in almost three weeks… although it should be stated that the market reaction is fairly muted,” noted XTB analyst David Cheetham.
