Instead, its active ingredient is THC, a psychoactive ingredient that causes a high. The beer which launched on July 30, is available in certain areas of California where cannabis is legal. Business Insider reveals that the beer drink is selling fast despite its high rate at N2,888 ($8). It, however, has a downside: it cannot be drunk in a bar. On the plus side, you do not experience a hangover from the beverage.
