Former Manchester United’s Portuguese manager Jose Mourinho (C) falls as he drops the puck to start a Continental hockey league match between Avangard Omsk and SKA Saint Petersburg in Balashikha outside Moscow on February 4, 2019. STRINGER / AFP Former Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho embarrassingly slipped after presenting a symbolic face-off to a match in Russia’s Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) on Monday. Videos of the 56-year-old boss falling on a red carpet on the ice rink in Balashikha appeared on social media after the accident. Mourinho was invited by KHL side Avangard Omsk in Siberia to take part in promotional work for the club and signed photographs ahead of the match with SKA Saint Petersburg. The two-time Champions League winner was helped back to his feet by Avangard’s former Detroit Red Wings centreman Pavel Datsyuk after the puck drop. Avangard play their home games in the city just outside Moscow after their usual arena was found to be unsafe for hosting games. Mourinho has been out of work since he was sacked by United in December after two-and-a-half years at the helm. Norwegian Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has lifted the Old Trafford side to fifth place in the Premier League table and is yet to lose as Red Devils boss since taking over from ‘The Special One’.
