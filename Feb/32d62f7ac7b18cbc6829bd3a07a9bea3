Microsoft plans to reveal two new consoles at the 2019 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). According to Metro UK, this includes a cheaper digital-only model. The report says Microsoft may be planning to announce a partnership with Nintendo and might use the event that begins in June to unveil the successor to the Xbox One; that was released 22 November, 2013. Microsoft already announced they were working on multiple consoles at last year’s E3, presumed to be both an entry level model and the next gen equivalent of the Xbox One X. Reports say they are codenamed Lockhart and Anaconda, with supposed technical specifications already having been leaked. French website, JeuxVideo suggests that Lockhart will have no disc drive and be digital-only. That will help make the console as cheap as possible and will also align with Microsoft’s plans for streaming all its games via Project xCloud. The Anaconda model will have a disc drive though, while both models will feature an SSD hard drive to enable faster loading times. Lockhart specs: CPU: Custom 8 cores – 16 zen threads 2 GPU: Custom NAVI 4+ teraflops RAM: 12GB of GDDR6 memory Storage: 1TB NVMe 1+ GB/s SSD hard drive Anaconda specs: CPU: Custom 8 cores – 16 zen threads 2 GPU: Custom NAVI 12+ teraflops RAM: 16GB of GDDR6 memory Storage: 1TB NVMe 1+ GB/s SSD hard drive
