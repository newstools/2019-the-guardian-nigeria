A helicopter in which Nigeria’s vice president Yemi Osinbajo was travelling crash landed in Kabba, Kogi State, his media aide said on Saturday. Laolu Akande said the vice president and the crew were unhurt. “VP Osinbajo’s Chopper crash lands in Kabba, but he and the entire crew safe,” Akande tweeted. “He is continuing with his engagements and plans for the day in Kogi State.” The vice president later tweeted that he was safe while thanking those who showed concern. “We are safe and sound! Thank you to everyone who has expressed concern and thank you to the crew who managed the situation well. We believe that God will continue to keep us and Nigeria safe even as we go higher. We continue #NextLevelEngagements in Kabba, Kogi State,” Professor Osinbajo tweeted. This is not the first time the Vice President’s helicopter will be involved in such an accident. In June 2018, his chopper was forced to land a few seconds after taking off from the Nigeria Customs Command and Staff College, Gwagwalada in Abuja. The VP had gone to the college for the graduation ceremony of Senior Division Course 1/2018 participants. The Saturday accident happened at a crucial time in Nigeria as the general elections are holding in exactly two weeks. The VP has spent a lot of time on the campaign trail, focusing more on meeting the electorate in their homes and market stalls. His strategy, analysts said, is important to the re-election bid of President Muhammadu Buhari. Akande said the helicopter accident would not hinder Osinbajo from continuing his campaigning.
