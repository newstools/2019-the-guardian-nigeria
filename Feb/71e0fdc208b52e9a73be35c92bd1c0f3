 Oche Odoh  Oboh missed the cut in the Tour-opening Canon Ladies Open by two points last week, but she bounced back in Gauteng, Johannesburg despite a slow start in round one on Tuesday. The pair ended Tuesday on the 14th position with a modified format earning 38 points in a four ball better ball format, which meant they were scored based on the lowest score per hole. They played a combined card of three under par for the day. The duo, however, found their form with an early birdie on the first hole and never took their feet off the pedal, rolling in eight birdies en route a score of eight under par and score of 44. They missed out on the winners’ trophy by just two points, but the feat indicates that Oboh’s game is getting stronger as the Tour progresses. Next stop is George, South Africa, for her third tournament, which is the prestigious Data Dimensions tournament at the George Golf Club and Fancourt Golf Clubs. The competition will feature both men and ladies, including Nigeria’s foremost men’s golfer, Oche Odoh.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
