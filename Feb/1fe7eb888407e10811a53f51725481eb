 Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and his wife, Dolapo, voting at the Code 33, Polling Unit II, Victoria Garden City (VGC), Lagos …yesterday  Speaking after voting, Osinbajo, accompanied by his wife, Dolapo, said: “I feel deeply satisfied that am able to vote and every Nigerian is allowed to do so. Everybody has a right to vote. The Vice President’s vote is not in any way more important than that of the security man. I advise that we exercise our franchise and vote in the right leaders, and encourage others to do so. It’s a civic responsibility.” Similarly, the Presidential Candidate of the Alliance for New Nigeria (ANN), Mr. Fela Durotoye, who shared same polling unit with Osinbajo, was happy with the process despite the hiccups, as three of the card readers didn’t work after starting about an hour behind scheduled time. Ambode, who got to his Ogunmodede College, Ajaganabe Area, Papa Epe polling unit with his wife around 9:48am, voted at exactly 10:01am.
At VGC, Lekki, 80 year-old Godfrey Chidozie, a retiree on wheelchair, said voting is a civic duty that must be performed by all. He prayed that the process ended well. At Lagos Island Ward 12 Broad Street, Polling Unit 1, the APC and PDP party agents told The Guardian at 1:30pm that about 10 percent of expected votes had shown up, because voting started late, aside the fact that one of the card readers initially malfunctioned. At Surulere, Polling Unit 26, Lawanson Road, only 49 voted of the over 1, 000 registered voters, while in Polling Unit 13, Randle Junction only 88 voted. At Polling Unit 13, Madueke Way, Surulere, armed men carted away ballot boxes for the House of Representatives and presidential elections. The presiding officer said the four men shot sporadically into the air to scare away voters, warning them not to exchange their lives for ballot boxes.
