Dogara, representing the People’s Democratic Party, polled 73,609 votes to defeat his closest challenger, All Progressives Congress’s Dalhatu Kantana, who scored 50,078 results. “I dedicate this victory to God first and our ever peace loving and resilient people of Bogoro/Dass/Tafawa Balewa Federal Constituency who defied all odds to return me to @HouseNGR for an unprecedented 4th term,” Dogara said on Sunday evening. “By their uncommon courage, sacrifice and patience in the face of unwarranted provocation, threat & intimidation & attempts to subvert their will by undemocratic forces, theya have made history today in Nigeria by breaking a jinx that has plagued the @HouseNGR since 1st Assembly as no presiding officer (both Speaker & Deputy Speaker) has ever been re-elected to the House. “Bogoro/Dass/Tafawa Balewa has also set a record as the first in Bauchi state to return a member to @HouseNGR for fourth consecutive term.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
