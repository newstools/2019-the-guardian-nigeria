To reduce the number of deaths recorded at accident scenes, the Lagos State government has handed over 200 first aid boxes to officers of the Lagos State Traffic management Authority, (LASTMA). The Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Health Matters, Dr. Sola Pitan, who handed over the first aid boxes to the Chief Executive Officer of LASTMA, Mr. Chris Olakpe and the General Manager, Olawale Musa, yesterday, said the equipment conform to international standard on emergency response.He said: “With these boxes, LASTMA officers are empowered and able to swiftly assist in saving the lives of accident victims from the jaws of death, while awaiting the arrival of the ambulance.”
 
The SSA explained that to aid proper use of the box, no fewer than 1,100 LASTMA officers were trained on scene safety management and calling for help strategy at accident scene. “Also, they were trained on the use of personal protective equipment, control of bleeding and management of victims with fractures and cardiopulmonary resuscitation at accident scenes.”
   
Pitan noted that the idea was in line with Ambode’s vision of ensuring all first responders at emergency scene were equipped with necessary skill set and tools to save accident victims that were in dire need of their intervention.Responding, Olakpe assured the governor that the training they undergone would aid proper use of the facilities in the state. According to him, it will be put to good use especially for the officers and victims of road accident. They have undergone the necessary training.
