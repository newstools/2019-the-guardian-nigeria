Scores of hoodlums suspected to be political thugs on Sunday night allegedly ambushed an ad-hoc staff of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Ogun State and killed a policeman attached to the escort vehicle. The hoodlums, according to a source, had allegedly attempted to snatch election results from the INEC staff at Ilaro in Ogun State. The source said the police escort had put in a stiff resistance but he was killed in the shoot-out between him and the thugs. The policeman, identified as Sergeant Idoko Sunday, was escorting the INEC officials and the results from Ipokia area to Ilaro, when the unexpected occurred at about 8:00p.m. Although Sergeant Sunday and another police escort, as gathered, attempted to prevent the move by engaging the bandits in a gun duel, Sunday was however shot in the chest and rib region in the process. A team of military and police personnel, who were alerted of the attack, repelled the hoodlums. When contacted, spokesman for the Ogun State Police Command, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident, informing that the command was still on the trail of the hoodlums. He added that the Commissioner of Police, CP Ahmed Illyasu, had directed the Deputy Commissioner of Police in-charge of the State Criminal Intelligence and Investigations Department, SCIID to take over the investigation with a view to arresting perpetrators of the dastardly act.
