Following the mixed reactions that has trailed Cardi B’s recent historic win at the 2019 Grammy awards, Lady Gaga has come to the rapper’s defense. Cardi B had clinched the award for Best Rap Album and not only did she emerge winner ahead of some rap heavyweights but she also became the first woman to win in the keenly contested category. Not only that, some of the backlashes also had to do with Cardi B being a Latina and her win is considered an insult to blacks in Black History month. However, Lady Gaga is of a different opinion as she showered love on Cardi B in celebration of the award. “It is so hard to be a woman in this industry. What it takes, how hard we work through the disrespectful challenges, just to make art,” she tweeted.
“I love you Cardi. You deserve your awards. Let’s celebrate her fight.
“Lift her up & honor her. She is brave.” It would be recalled that Cardi B was forced to deactivate her Instagram following the backlash and criticism she received for her Grammy win. Before she deleted her account, she had taken to the platform to acknowledge the late Mac Miller who was also one of the contenders in the category.
