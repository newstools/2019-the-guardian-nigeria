Ariana Grande has been announced as the headline act of Manchester Pride 2019 two years on from the 2017 terrorist attack. According to the BBC, she will perform at a new 9,000-capacity outdoor venue, which is situated at an old railway depot on Sunday, 25 August. The American singer and songwriter, 25, first returned to Manchester to headline the One Love gig in June 2017, two weeks after twenty-two people died and hundreds were injured in a suicide attack at her Manchester Arena show. The singer will return to headline the LGBT+ event, while on a break from her Sweetener tour. A source previously told The Sun: “Manchester holds a very special place in Ariana’s heart and she’s made it clear she wants to do whatever she can for the city. “She was in talks to ­perform at Manchester Pride this year but ­unfortunately they just could not make it work due to various reasons down to space and security. “It is going to be really ­special if it does work out, particularly given how much Ariana means to everyone in the city.” But today, she wrote on Twitter: “Manchester babes, I’m so thrilled to be headlining pride. my heart. I can’t wait to see u and I love u so so much.” manchester babes, i’m so thrilled to be headlining pride. my heart. i cant wait to see u and i love u so so much. — Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) February 25, 2019
