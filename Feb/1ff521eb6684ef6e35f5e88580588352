Roy explained that the submarine cables would connect Lagos directly to Southern parts of Nigeria. “We plan to initiate new data analytic tools to capture subscribers’ experience in real time and also take pre-emptive actions to improve the network. “Also new sites would be rolled out into rural areas, banishing digital divide between cities and villages,’’ he said. Roy noted that the company would also roll out new densification sites to increase capacity by giving a congestion-free network and superior quality in voice data. “We also plan to swap old equipment in other states with better quality ones, so that our subscribers can have better services. “Also new enterprise products to cater for the need of Small, Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and the rural areas would be initiated this year, ‘’ he said. Roy noted that the project was an ambitious one but the company planned to move forward with it to satisfy the subscribers.
