On Thursday night’s episode of Celebrity Big Brother, Dina Lohan admitted she’s in love with a man whom she’s never met or even video called.
In the episode, Lindsay Lohan’s 56-year-old mother confided to fellow houseguests on the CBS reality show about her lengthy telephone chats with a mysterious ‘special someone.’ “I can’t wait to tell you about this guy,” she told three other contestants on the show. “I’ve been talking to him for five years. Like, every day. A lot. I feel like I know him.” She continued, “You know when you talk to someone on the phone like you feel like you know them?” According to Lohan, she hasn’t met her long-term boyfriend yet because he’s been living in San Francisco, where he cares for his mother and apparently, he doesn’t use FaceTime. “It’s personal,” she said. “He’s real. I swear, it’s crazy. But I’m going to marry him. It’s really, really true. I talk to his ma!” ‘I’m gonna marry him. It’s really true,’ Dina gushed about the man in question, But her housemates were skeptical and told her she’s probably getting catfished.
