Chief Joseph Iloh PHOTO: CHUKWUMA MUANYA Following arson attacks at some INEC offices nationwide and two weeks ago in Abia state, the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Chief Joseph Iloh, has moved to check the menace even as he promised 70 percent voters turnout on election day. Iloh told journalists in Umuahia on Thursday that the threat of arson was real in Abia state and drastic measures were being taken to check the situation. He said that has forced INEC Abia to send the sensitive materials directly from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to the local government areas (LGAs) en route the registration areas (RAs). “As you can see, what we have here are the non-sensitive materials. For security reasons and for more efficiency we have made adjustments on the movement of sensitive materials,” he said. Iloh said unlike what happened in Osun and elsewhere where there was about 44 per cent voters’ participation, there will be more than 70 percent turnout of Saturday. “We have done a lot of voters’ education. From what we have seen so far, we expect a very high turnout of voters.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
