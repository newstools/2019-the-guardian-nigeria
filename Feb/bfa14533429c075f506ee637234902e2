 Idris Aregbe  The admission-free event, which is slated to hold on Monday, February, 2019, at the APC Secretariat, Acme Road, Ogba, Lagos, at 10 a.m, according to the organisers, is focused on mobilising and educating young people to achieve peaceful election, while also sensitising them to take a leap now and take the lead tomorrow, so as to promote youth empowerment and political participation. Speaking on the event, the Youth Organising Secretary of the Lagos APC and Convener of frontline socio-political group ‘Our Lagos, Your Lagos’, Idris Aregbe, disclosed that the programme would feature party stalwarts, party faithful, youth ambassadors, A-list actors, actresses, artistes, comedians, youth influencers and other important personalities – all of whom would be on ground to impart positively on the youths ahead of the general elections. “We are very close to elections right now, which is scheduled for February 16 and March 2, so we are trying to do a lot of reach outs telling the people that they need to be part of the process and how.” Aregbe said. “So we would be educating them on elections principles and for them to shun violence and also on the need for our party to win the elections.“So it specifically designed for the elections – how to vote, what and what to do, expectations as a young person on the Election Day and the principle of the elections, because we know that every election year, whether we like it or not, INEC comes up with additional structures. Like now we are going to be voting with index finger and so we would push out such message to our people.”
 
“It is an election year and we know that we need to do a lot to mobilise our people and educate them for a peaceful election and that is what my office has been doing to ensure that the youth are carried along and to bring them together for progress.” He added.He therefore urged all and sundry to keep the belief of an effective electoral system alive by coming out en-masse to exercise their franchise in order to hold in high-hopes the dreams of a better Nigeria.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
