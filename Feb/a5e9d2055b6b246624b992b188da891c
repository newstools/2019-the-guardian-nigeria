The Chairman of Nosak Group, Dr. Toni Ogunbor has asked the Federal Government to check smuggling and lack of accountability in the Nigeria Customs Service. Speaking at the Annual Management Retreat of the company themed, ‘Strengthen the chain through the customer’, Ogunbor said: “Government should engage competent hands to ensure the right things are done to oversee the borders, which will help to end or ameliorate the current unholy price war experienced by local manufacturers.” He commended the company’s management team for surmounting the challenging business environment to achieve results, thereby, contributing to Nigeria’s economic growth. “2018 was a more challenging year compared to 2017, but we are happy that the challenges didn’t overwhelm us. This is the result of hard work and dedication,” he said. From the retreat, Nosak Group also set goals to further boost the economy and increase job creation through importation of oil palm seedlings required for the backward integration for the group’s Famili Vegetable oil business. The company reviewed its 2018 operation and charted objectives for 2019, leveraging on the group’s comparative advantage. The group operates across agribusiness, financial service, manufacturing, real estate, and retail business with a unifying mission to foster an environment of success that supports each subsidiary in becoming the dominant player in its sector.
