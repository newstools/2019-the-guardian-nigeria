Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to order the immediate withdrawal of armed military operatives out of Abonnema area of the state. Wike alleged that the military personnel were recruited by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to unleash mayhem on members of the People’s Democratic Party members in Abonnema and other towns during the presidential and National Assembly elections. “I call on Mr President to please, in the name of God direct the army to withdraw the occupation and siege on Abonnema and Bonny communities so that the people can go about with their normal lives”, Wike said. Prior to Wike’s plea for the withdrawal of armed personnel in Abonnema, reports said about 11 people died as a result of electoral violence in the area. The governor, however, stated that persons responsible for the murder of the victims will not go unpunished. “Let it be known that those who masterminded the murderous assault on Abonnema and other communities in Rivers State last Saturday have bloodstains on their hands, for which they are all answerable before the Almighty God. “I wish to assure all and sundry that we shall as a government pursue justice for the families of the victims against the perpetrators of the mayhem, killings and destructions in Abonema, Buguma, Degema and other places no matter how powerful they may seem and how long it may take”. He called on all residents of the state to ensure peace during and after the election. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
