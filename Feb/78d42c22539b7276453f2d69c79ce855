 National identity card by NIMC  Usman gave the commendation on Friday,while enrolling for his National Identification Number (NIN) at the NIMC Abuja Headquarters. The D-G expressed his delight and satisfaction on the smooth enrolment process and encouraged other Nigerians who have not registered to do so, saying that it is very important and must be taken seriously. “I implore all Nigerians to ensure they are captured into the Database in good time, so they can be issued with their own unique number for identification even beyond the shores of the country”. According to him, the National Identity Management Scheme is a laudable project by the Federal Government to ensure that all Nigerians and legal residents are properly enrolled, identified and issued with an identification number. He said that countries across the world that have embraced a similar system, had long resolved issues of identity of its citizens. Usman cited the United States of America as an example of countries where every citizen had a Social Security Number. He said that NCAA would assist NIMC in the area of verification as an agency of government responsible for licensing aviation personnel. “This is a commendable initiative and we hope to collaborate with NIMC, and key into the project to ensure that the data captured are properly exchanged. “In the USA, they have tied the Social Security Number with pilots and aviation personnel licenses, because of the importance of having one standard data and NCAA can also do the same,” he added.
