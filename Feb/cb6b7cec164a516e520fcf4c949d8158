PHOTO: Twitter/Bayo Omoboriowo The All Progressive Congress (APC) Presidential Candidate, Muhammadu Buhari, said he was uncomfortable that the APC candidates in Rivers State will not be able to participate in the forthcoming election. Buhari made this known at an APC mega rally in Rivers State on Tuesday. The Supreme Court had ruled that the APC candidates in Rivers State will not contest any position in the state including the 32 House of Assembly seats, 13 House of Representatives positions, three senatorial positions and the gubernatorial position. The Supreme court in its ruling earlier nullified the party from participating and ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) not to recognize the party in all polling units, over a crisis in River State. Buhari in his statement noted that justice will be done in the country, as he enjoined the candidates to be patient. “I am very disturbed by the decision that we are not allowed to participate in some of the processes. I have no doubt that I got elected but I have to respect the institutions that I inherited. I assure you and I recommend that you remain patient and resolute. We will ensure that justice is done in this country.” In the crisis, two factions emerged one led by Rotimi one led by the minister of transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, and the other led by Senator Magnus Abe. The crisis became a legal issue that was dragged from the state High court all the way to the Supreme Court. A Federal High Court ruled that the primaries conducted by both factions was illegal and proceeded to disqualify the party from the election in state. The Supreme Court therefore upheld the nullification of the candidates. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
