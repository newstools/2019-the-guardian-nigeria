The Chief Executive Officer, National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr. Faisal Shuaib has commended Enugu Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi for his administration’s reforms in the health sector, which have ensured effective service delivery in the state’s primary healthcare. Shuaib, who spoke when he led members of the team on a courtesy visit to Ugwuanyi at the Government House, Enugu, noted that the governor’s giant strides in the area of primary healthcare delivery are commendable and worthy of emulation. The Executive Director stated his delegation was impressed that Enugu
State is one of the most viable states fulfilling most of the requirements needed to access funds mapped out for primary healthcare delivery. Shuaib also paid glowing tribute to the governor for the successes his administration has recorded in immunisation programme, stating that the efforts have given hope to children and vulnerable groups. The NPHCDA boss, therefore, maintained that the governor’s laudable achievements have necessitated his agency’s resolve to seek collaboration with the state, and that based on their assessment, Enugu State is qualified for the Federal Government’s over N50bn support fund for primary healthcare delivery in the country.
