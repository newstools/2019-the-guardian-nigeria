Speaking on the match, MFM FC striker, Adeniji Adewole Kabir, affirmed that his teammates are battle ready. “Our match against Niger Tornadoes is going to be a tough one. It is true that we are on top of the table, but that does not mean we are going to look down on them, because they are not doing well. We need to prove to them that as leaders of the group, just as we won our last away game, we can also come back home to win our matches. “We’ve been counselled by Coach Fidelis Ilechukwu to always be at our very best if we have to make history for ourselves,” he said. A former Stationary Stores forward, Kabir, who has been outstanding for his club this season after scoring three goals in six appearances, told MFM Media, that it is only victory in today’s encounter that would guarantee them a top place finish after this week NPFL’s fixtures. “This Sunday’s game is very important to us and the three points is very key. We need to grab victory to remain at the top because Katsina United are right behind us on the table. So, we must win,” he stated.
