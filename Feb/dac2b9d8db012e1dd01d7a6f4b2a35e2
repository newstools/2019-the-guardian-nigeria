All the other ladies in the game better level up because Ciara is not here to play. The mother of two is dripping major sex appeal as she drops the follow up to her hit song, “Level Up”. The new song titled, “Greatest Love” is not only expected to be an instant bop but it also comes with a super steamy music video. The 33-year-old songstress has every one of us want to fall in love with the track which was released today, February 12 and we can’t think of any better time considering Valentine is just around the corner. The song is a romantic track presumably penned for her husband, Russell Wilson and should you still be looking for your Valentine’s Day anthem, you now have one! Thanks, CiCi. In the accompanying music video, Ciara is seen flaunting her toned body in an entirely sheer bodysuit as she shimmies and belts out her new tune. Her envy-inducing curves, as well as undeniable beauty, will put many a woman to shame. To prove that Ciara came all fierce and ready to take over, the new video became an instant fan favourite so much so that it became a trending topic on Twitter, as social media caught fire with excited fan responses. “I wake up and #GreatestLove is the #1 trending topic come on fave,” one proud fan wrote. “Greatest Love by Ciara is the musical representation of love I needed before Valentine’s Day. We are SO happy for you sis,” another said. “Ok @ciara. Lets go with the baby making music! #GreatestLove is a vibe and a mood. Vintage Ciara,” another Tweet read. Watch and listen to the new song below and decide for yourself if it doesn’t make you want to fall in love.
