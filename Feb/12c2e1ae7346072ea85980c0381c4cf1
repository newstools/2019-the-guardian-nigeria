Troubled rapper 6ix9ine is spending thousands of dollars to provide personal security for his mother for fear of her safety. On January 23rd, 6ix9ine pleaded guilty in the federal racketeering case against him. It was also revealed that he was cooperating against people who were his co-defendants up until recently. There’s a drug charge as well, specifically centering around his plan to sell a kilogram of heroin or, as the plea puts it, “mixtures and substances containing a detectable amount of heroin”, in addition to firearm offenses too. The rapper is particularly worried that anyone looking for revenge could hurt her in the process. His attorney, Dawn Florio, told TMZ; “6ix9ine has the means to pay for his family’s private security, so the government expects the money to come out of his pocket to protect his closest family members.” She also said that the government would become involved if he can’t afford security.” Takeshi faces a minimum of 47 years behind bars as of now, but it seems likely he’ll get less in exchange for his cooperation with the government. His sentencing date is set for Jan. 24, 2020.
