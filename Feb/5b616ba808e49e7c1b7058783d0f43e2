Police arrest four for allegedly inserting pepper on lady’s genital in Edo
An unidentified young man suspected to be a cultist was yesterday stoned to death by a mob at Modern Market, Makurdi, Benue State capital. An eyewitness who preferred anonymity told The Guardian that the incident occurred early in the morning before the market opened for business. It was gathered that the victim was trailed to the spot by rival cult members where he was stoned to death. “They smashed his head with stones and left him in a pool of his own blood,” he stated. Meanwhile, police operatives in Edo State yesterday paraded four suspects for inserting pepper into a young girl’s private part over an alleged phone theft. The suspects were alleged to have stripped naked and beaten one Favour Ada mercilessly, before inserting pepper into her private part and made a video of her, which went viral on social media. The suspects, Otoghile Joel (36), Lucky Igbinovia (52), Edobor Osemwengie (30), Kingsley Iyamu (50) and Ekpomwen (25), accused the victim of stealing an iPhone X worth N440,000 when one of suspects took her to a hotel. Parading the suspects, the Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosun, said they would be charged to court as soon as investigation is completed. The suspects, however, denied any involvement in the crime. The victim, while speaking with newsmen, said the incident was her worst moment in life. She said after she was accused of stealing the phone, they took her to a native doctor who mysteriously implanted bullets into her stomach and later threatened her with a live snake. She said in order not to die, she admitted to the crime and the bullets were later removed from her stomach after confessing to it.
