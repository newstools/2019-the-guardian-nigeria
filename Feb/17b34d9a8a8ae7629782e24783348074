King of Pop, Michael Jackson, has been seen in a video giggling and quoting Bible verses as he’s questioned about sexual molestation. In a new video obtained by DailymailTV, Michael Jackson is questioned by lawyers at the Four Seasons At t Hotel in New York City on March 1, 1996. Jackson appears to squirm on his chair after he is asked if he sexually molested Macaulay Culkin, Jordan Chandler and Brett Barnes in video footage dated March 1, 1996. Rather than answer, the nervous singer tried to joke his way through the questions. The video is a part of the “Leaving Neverland” documentary shown at the Sundance Film Festival. It should be recalled that former child stars, Wade Robson and James Safechuck claimed that they were going to reveal their sex abuse experience in the star’s ranch in the documentary but this was almost drowned by fans of Jackson who threatened to boycott the airing of the documentary. In three hour video, Jackson is seen explaining that he has been misrepresented like Jesus. The video shows him scratching his neck, chest and head while denying that he knows a staff (Brett Barnes) who accused him. He first reacts with shock before smiling and shaking his head. Again, Ring asks, ‘To your knowledge were you ever accused of sexually molesting Macaulay?’ He reacts by touching his head and lounging back into the chair. He never answered it. According to Daily Mail, the film was taped by five Neverland staff who claim that they were wrongfully dismissed. One of the lawyers of the five, Michael Ring alleged that Jackson had threatened staff who had caught in him in the act. In the video, he was aided by his advisor Steve Cochrane and another legal advisor Zia Modabber. At the time of the recording, Jackson was 37.
