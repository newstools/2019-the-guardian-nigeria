The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibadan Zonal Office, yesterday secured the conviction of Osikoya Gbolahan and Rabiu Daniel for offences bordering on impersonation and fraudulently sharing pornographic and indecent pictures. EFCC’s acting spokesperson, Tony Orilade, said in a statement yesterday in Abuja. They were arraigned before Justice Watilat Ibrahim of a Federal High Court sitting in Abeokuta, Ogun State on December 10, 2018. The charge against Osikoya read: “That you, Osikoya Gbolahon (aka Mary; aka Lisa Burkholder) sometimes in 2018, at Awa-Ijebu knowingly sent pornographic and indecent pictures with your e-mail through a computer system and network to one Michael Lukianoff and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 24 (1) (a) and punishable under Section 24 (1) of the Cyber Crimes (Prohibition, Prevention Etc) Act, 2015.” They, however, pleaded “guilty” to the charge, after opting for a plea bargain. In view of the plea, counsel for the EFCC, Abdulrasheed Suleman, prayed the court to convict them accordingly. Justice Ibrahim, thereafter, convicted them and sentenced them to four months in prison, starting from the date of their arrest. Osikoya was also ordered to forfeit his Honda Accord car, two phones and laptop computer to the Federal Government. In addition to forfeiting his two iPhones and laptop computer, Rabiu was ordered to refund $500 to his victim.
