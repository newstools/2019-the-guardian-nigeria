We expect profit taking activities in fundamentally good stocks as the market closes for the week.” Investdata Consulting Limited said: “Volatility will also continue as investors and fund managers reposition their portfolios, with eyes fixed on political space and ahead of January inflation data, which is another factor likely to drive prices north, or south, while determining market direction before or after the Presidential Election. Investors should review their positions in line with their investment goals, strength of the company numbers and act as events unfold in the global and domestic environment. “However, we would like to reiterate our advice that investors should go for equities with intrinsic value.
