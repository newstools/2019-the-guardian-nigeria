 Lagos ADP guber candidate, Babatunde Gbadamosi  The defectors, under the aegis of the G89 group, comprised the party’s stakeholders’ from Ikorodu, Somolu, Ajah, Epe, and Kosofe local government areas, known to be strong members of AD in Lagos. In a statement jointly issued by its executive led by Eniola Ojajuni, Caleb Agbanimu and Ikudehinbu Matthew, the group said Gbadamosi was the only candidate that has what it takes to take Lagos to greater heights. “After due consultation and brainstorming, we hereby declare that Gbadamosi is the best candidate to govern Lagos. “He is a man of integrity. We have decided not only to join the ADP, but to also join forces and form a movement that will deliver maximum votes for him (Gbadamosi) in the gubernatorial election. With his level of experience and by popular demand, he deserves to be the next governor of Lagos,” the statement reads. They also promised to deliver the wards and units under its jurisdiction to Gbadamosi, just as it would ensure propagation of the visions and plans the ADP candidate has for the state. “The G89 will not relent until citizens of Lagos get the best. Lagos people could no longer afford to fold their hands while the state is robbed in the guise of governance without dividends of democracy getting to the grassroots,” it added.
