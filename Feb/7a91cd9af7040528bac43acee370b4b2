A look at the visuals at a Meji Alabi production and it is clear what he stands for: quality, crisp and visuals that speak volumes. From Seyi Shay’s “Right Now”, Maleek Berry’s “Kontrol” and more recently Davido’s “Assurance” and Wizkid’s “Fever”, Alabi has managed to spark conversations while engaging the audience. One thing is certain, his influence has gone beyond grabbing the attention of Africa’s audience to getting the admiration of music mogul Jay Z. Despite this, he says that the reason for his hard work is driven by his desire for creative growth and not money. Speaking on the overflogged video concepts in Afrobeats, he says: “I guess it is easy to fall into the trap of how to make an Afrobeat video, add some colour, lots of dancing, people have seen that a hundred times so that when they see it again, they go, I know what this is and turn the television off,” he said. “As a creative, you have to feed your own soul while feeding your artiste and make sure you are self-serving in the sense of – I want to push this video as hard as I can,” he adds. The London-based director is constantly on the move in and across the African continent. Despite the consistency of churning out his works, he has kept his personal life private. On how he is able to manage his relationship with his relatively unknown partner and two children, he gives us a sneak peek into his affair. Grab a copy of the Guardian Life this Sunday as we delve into his love for his life as a director and life as a family man.
