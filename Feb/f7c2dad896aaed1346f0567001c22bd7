 [FILE PHOTO] Delta State Governor, H.E Sen. Dr. Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa  Governor Okowa made the call yesterday when he paid a condolence visit to the family of his political aide, Mr. Ngozi Ijei, who was allegedly assassinated in Ekpan, Uvwie Council of Delta State, on the eve of the botched presidential and National Assembly elections. According to the governor, the death of Ijei was politically-motivated. “In the last two years, we had worked to have peace in the Ekpan area and he played a crucial role in the peace process. Unfortunately, those who do not value life decided to strike. It is not the best thing to do, for it does not pay for us to lose a life to win in an election. “We should continue to embrace peace as the election comes up because, going to the extent of using guns to get votes is not the best way for our country. I believe that it is important for all Nigerians to realise that getting votes can be achieved by what one has already done and the improvement that can be seen, not by violence.” He urged the bereaved family to take solace in the fact that nothing happens without the knowledge of God. “I know that the loss of a dear one is very painful, but stay strong for the children,” the governor told Mrs. Veronica Ijei, wife of the deceased who was crying throughout the visit. “Depend on God. I beg you, stay strong for the sake of these children and be prayerful. God will take control of every situation.” Accept our condolences and in everything that you think or do, you must look up to God.” Okowa, who was in a pensive mood, wrote in the condolence register: “Ngozi was an architect of peace in the new Ekpan of our dream; he had worked largely with the security agencies in the last two years to make Ekpan peaceful; we will miss him dearly for his contributions.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
