The forest extends to neighbouring states, especially Zamfara, where reports of the nefarious acts of kidnappers, rustlers and bandits operate daily without let. Governor Masari had recently raised the alarm that the state was under siege. He had also last week appealed to herdsmen to caution their wards against banditry and related ills. The governor warned that people might resort to self- help as a way out if the attacks persist. The police public relations officers for the state command, SP Gambo Isah, who confirmed the incident, said the bandits also laid an ambush for the military personnel before one of them was killed. He said the commissioner of police, Sanusi Buba, had visited the scene to commiserate with the injured and those that lost their loved ones. The spokesman refuted the rustling of cows claim, instead he said the bandits broke into homes and carted away funds and phones. Isah, however, said security had been beefed up in the area. The governor, who also visited the settlement, sympathised with the villagers over the incident. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
