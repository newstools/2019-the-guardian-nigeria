 Managing Director of IEI Anchor Pension, Glory Etaduovie  “Aging becomes undignified. Health and maintenance remain a critical issue of aging. The current working population is thus under siege. There are endless requests for support here and there.”He however, assured that Micro pension has become an invaluable tool to bridge this terrible deficit in financial inclusion and its ripple effects for no plans for aging and retirement in the unstructured business circles – whether with official retirement age or not. 
 
“Financial Inclusion is total. Total in the sense that this philosophy drags in the so-called underprivileged or low income segment into the opportunities and exposures that financial world offers. A lot of people are shut of a world of opportunities of the financial sector offers to enhance their present and future lives. “Though beyond pension only, this platform now sucks them in through their cluster bodies to expose them to the knowledge and benefits of not only pension plans, but puts them into a community of people who can tap into other benefits accrue-able to cluster bodies. This thus makes up for short falls of individual small businesses access to comprehensive financial services available to all. 
 
“This, of course, leads to empowerment and economic growth and development. Etaduovie, said that PenCom has done well so far. It is a new learning needing to be domiciled. They have had to wade through un-structured parts to create in-routes for Industry path and public assimilation and integration. Change pioneering and buy-ins are amongst most difficult things to achieve,” he added. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
