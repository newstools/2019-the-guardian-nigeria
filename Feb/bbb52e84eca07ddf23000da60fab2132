The Migos have shared a new track titled “Position to Win” presumably something to keep fans occupied as they patiently await Culture III.
Fans got a first listen of the record last month, when it was featured in Mountain Dew’s “Do the Dew” campaign commercial. The ad featured Offset, Quavo, and Takeoff, as well as UFC star Holly Holm, NBA All-Star Joel Embiid, as well as skateboarders Sean Malto and Mariah Duran. Quavo spoke to Complex about the “Lets Do” ad saying, “Position to Win’ is just a motivational, feel-good record,”  “It’s a highly energetic record, a chant, a song for you to be ready to go out to battle and fight. Fight for what’s right, fight for nothing but positive energy. No negative energy. Ready to step it up, go hard and don’t quit, you know what I’m saying? It automatically puts you in a position to win once you step it up.” Listen to “Position to Win” on YouTube below;
