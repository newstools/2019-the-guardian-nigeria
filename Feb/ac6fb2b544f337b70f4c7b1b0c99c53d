The national chairman of the  ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole said the People’s Democratic Party’s candidate in the 2019 presidential election Atiku Abubakar, “is destined never to be president of Nigeria.” “It borders on arrogance that our future is tied on his presidency. Atiku is destined never to be president of Nigeria,” Oshiomhole told journalist during a press conference in Abuja on Thursday. “Leadership is about character. Atiku’s desperation is so obvious, so desperate that in 2003, he challenged his own boss, President Olusegun Obasanjo, not to do a second term,” he added. Abubakar lost the 2019 presidential election to incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari. “I hereby reject the result of February 23, 2019 sham election and will be challenging it in court,” Atiku said hours after the Buhari was declared president. A former ally of President Buhari, Abubakar led a motley pack of challengers, most of whom posed no serious obstacle to Buhari’s re-election. Observers said killings, malpractices and attacks on electoral officials marred the elections which held a week after it was earlier scheduled. In the final tally announced by the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, Buhari polled 15, 191, 847 votes while Abubakar, a former Nigerian vice president between 1999 and 2007, got 11, 262, 978 votes. Oshiomhole, however, stated that the election “was a referendum between ‘integrity’ and ‘no integrity’ and Nigerians made their choice.
