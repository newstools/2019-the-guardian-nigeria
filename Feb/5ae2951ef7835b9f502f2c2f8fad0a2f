The digestive system helps convert our meals into usable forms for the cells in our body. This is necessary for good health and well-being. When there is an injury or tear to body surfaces lined by cells, it is called an ulcer. These sores may be found in any part of the digestive system, but the stomach and the duodenum, a part of the small intestine that immediately follows the stomach, are the most commonly affected areas. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-860378 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Helicobacter-pylori-Photo-Verwell-Health.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Helicobacter-pylori-Photo-Verwell-Health.jpg 768w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Helicobacter-pylori-Photo-Verwell-Health-487x325.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Helicobacter-pylori-Photo-Verwell-Health-320x213.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Helicobacter-pylori-Photo-Verwell-Health-640x427.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Helicobacter-pylori-Photo-Verwell-Health-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium that resides in the stomach of people with peptic ulcer disease is thought to play a huge role in the development of this disease. Typically, the acids produced in the stomach is well controlled and finely balanced but H. pylori cause a loss of this balance. It causes the body to produce excess stomach acid, leading to the erosion of the normal stomach surface cells, causing ulceration. Some other factors, like an excess intake of some painkillers, alcohol, excessive salt intake, and smoking may cause peptic ulcer disease but H. pylori are responsible for a large chunk of all peptic ulcer diseases. H. pylori, the biggest cause of peptic ulcer is spread via ingestion of contaminated food and water.
