R&B singer, John Legend has said Tuesday, that R. Kelly’s accusers ‘deserve justice’. Legend was one of the few musicians to speak out on the sexual assault allegations against the embattled singer in the Lifetime documentary Surviving R Kelly. After an investigation by Chicago police, R Kelly, 52, was arrested last week and charged with ten counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse against four women, some of whom were aged less than 17 at the time the incidents are alleged to have taken place. Sharing his thoughts on the recent developments, Legend said on Tuesday’s episode of the Today Show: “I think it’s been a long time coming. “I think a lot of us kind of tolerated or looked the other way on that issue for a long time, and a lot of people were being hurt for decades, and we looked away for too long.” Addressing his involvement in the docu-series, directed by Dream Hampton, Legend said: “I’m so glad that the documentary [Surviving R. Kelly] was made. “I’m so glad that the victims got to have their voices heard, and I think them having their voices heard, this story being retold, because it’s been told before, but I think being retold through that medium really brought the issue to a lot of people’s attention, and I think it inspired the law enforcement to move on some things that they weren’t moving on before.’ He added, “Let justice play out, obviously it’s difficult to prove anything beyond a reasonable doubt in court so we’ll see what happens but I think his victims deserve justice.”
