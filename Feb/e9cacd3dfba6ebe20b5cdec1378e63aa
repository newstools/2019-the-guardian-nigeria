Michael Jackson’s estate has slammed HBO with a 36 billion naira ($100 million) lawsuit. According to claims by the estate in the suit, HBO promised not to take shots at Jackson in the documentary, “Leaving Neverland” but HBO went ahead to do just that. The estate is claiming damages could exceed the $100 million. According to the Estate, HBO signed a non-disparagement agreement with Jackson in 1992 when the network aired “Michael Jackson Live in Concert in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour.” In the contract, there was a non-disparagement provision, which includes, “HBO shall not make any disparaging remarks concerning Performer or any of his representatives, agents, or business practices or do any act that may harm or disparage or cause to lower in esteem the reputation or public image of performer.” It would be recalled we reported earlier that “Leaving Neverland” features two Jackson accusers,  James Safechuck and Wade Robson,  who alleges late Jackson molested them when they were children. The Estate claims the two are perjurers with no credibility since they have testified under oath no such molestation occurred. As of the time of filing this report, HBO is yet to issue a statement about the lawsuit.
