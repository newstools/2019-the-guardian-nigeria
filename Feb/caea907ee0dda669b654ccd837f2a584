There is no elevator to success; you have to take the stairs and the stairs to success is called DEDICATION. Success isn’t ‘lucky;’ it is hardwork and dedication. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow said: “The heights that great men reached and kept were not attained in sudden flight, but while their companions slept, they were toiling upwards in the night.” Long- term consistency beats short-term intensity. In my years of mentorship, I have observed that dedication always beats motivation. Motivation can get you started, but it is dedication that keeps you going. To keep anything in life (whether success or relationship), you need dedication and not motivation. When everything hurts, it is ONLY dedication that keeps you going. When life beats motivation out of you, it is only dedication that will keep you going. “Genius is one per cent inspiration, ninety-nine per cent perspiration-”Thomas A. Edison. As a relationship coach, I have observed people lose covenant and heavenly-designed relationships due to lack of dedication. Whether in relationship or mentorship, it is a great insult when you are not dedicated to people that are loyal to your growth. Relationship grows through mutual dedication. Someone once said: “Stop crossing oceans for people that won’t even jump a puddle for you.” I have often said that when we take things for granted, the things we are granted get taken. We lose what we are not dedicated to.Cultivate the culture of DEDICATION and watch your life change dramatically. Dedication takes you from average to awesome. You don’t achieve your goals because you are not good enough, but because you lack dedication. The strongest form of strength is absolute dedication. I truly believe that with hardwork, dedication and perseverance, we can become the best at what we do. No one wants to become mediocre. Nothing remarkable happens without dedication.“Decide what you want, decide what you are willing to exchange for it. Establish your priorities and go to work,” said Haroldson Lafayette Hunt Jnr. There is a difference between interest and dedication. When you are interested in doing something, you do it only when it is convenient. When you are dedicated to something, you accept no excuses, only results. I promise you this: You will be shocked at the impact of your persistent dedication. If you want significant change in your life, then try extreme dedication. Dedicate yourself to what gives your life true meaning and purpose. Be dedicated to personal development, great relationships, your dreams and constant improvement. Dedication and commitment are what transfer dreams into realities. Dedication, determination and hardwork will feed life into your dreams. When you put yourself in the dedication mode, you will come to realise the value in doing things because they are the right things to do, not because you want to do them or feel like doing them at the time. You understand that movement creates motivation, not the other way around, and that dedication is the most important factor in building a successful life. “Struggle ends where commitment begins,” said Sumner Davenport. Great minds are dedicated minds. Abraham Lincoln was dedicated; he was asked after failing repeatedly in politics what his next step would be, but he kept saying: “I will keep studying and preparing, and someday, my opportunity will come.” Alexander Graham Bell was dedicated to the idea of the telephone. Thomas Edison was dedicated to the idea of the electric bulb, no wonder he attempted the trials one thousand times before finally getting it. Albert Einstein was dedicated. Arnold Schwarzenegger is dedicated, even after he was told that he was too short for acting and his foreign intonation wouldn’t sell much in Hollywood, he was still undaunted. Jackie Chan is dedicated. Usain Bolt is dedicated. Mohammed Ali was dedicated. Roger Federer is dedicated. Lewis Hamilton is dedicated.“Any job very well done that has been carried out by a person who is fully dedicated is always a source of inspiration,” said Carlos Ghosn. True dedication, passion and hardwork towards your goal help to reach the path of success. One of America’s greatest minds, John D. Rockefeller, said: “I do not think there is any other quality so essential to success of any kind as the quality of perseverance. It overcomes almost everything, even nature.” The candid truth about dedication is: It will hurts. It will take time. It will require dedication. It will require willpower. You will need to make healthy decisions. It requires sacrifice. You will need to push your body to its max. There will be temptation, but I promise you, when you reach your goal, it is worth it. Kevin Ngo said: “If you don’t make the time to work on creating the life you want, you’re eventually going to be forced to spend a lot of time dealing with a life you don’t want.” Many youths are talented, but lazy. They keep blaming the government and the economy for their personal woes when their major problem is lack of dedication to a worthy cause. Dreams don’t work unless you do!
