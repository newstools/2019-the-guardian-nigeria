An investigation has been opened into an NYPD policeman who allegedly told his fellow officers to shoot 50 Cent. Insiders say that commanding officer Emanuel Gonzalez made the remark in June 2018 during roll call at the 72nd Precinct. 50 was set to attend an NYPD boxing match in the Bronx, which provoked Gonzalez to say, “Shoot him on sight.”
Apparently, Gonzalez and the rapper have underlying issues, according to the Daily News. The month before, Gonzalez filed an aggravated harassment complaint alleging 50 intimidated him on Instagram. 50 had claimed Gonzalez was guilty of “shaking down” the owner of one of 50’s favorite clubs. Afterward, he wrote on Instagram, “Get the strap,” according to Gonzalez. The caption was one of 50’s catchphrases throughout 2018.
Though the cop has said it was only a joke, the incident was reported to his superiors in his department and is being investigated by Internal Affairs. Gonzalez is still on active duty. 50 Cent’s representative told TMZ, “Mr. Jackson takes this threat very seriously and is consulting with his legal counsel regarding his options going forward. He is concerned that he was not previously advised of this threat by the NYPD and even more concerned that Gonzalez continues to carry a badge and a gun.”
