 Nigeria’s UFC World Middleweight title contender, Israel Adesanya.  The 185-pound contest, a UFC 234 pay-per-view event, is expected to serve as the co-main event. It will take place at Rod Laver Arena. A middleweight title fight between Robert Whittaker (20-4) and Kelvin Gastelum (15-3) is scheduled to headline the event. The Nigerian is seen as one of the hottest contenders in the sport. Adesanya, 29, will be coming off a breakout 2018. Fighting out of New Zealand, Adesanya (15-0) made his UFC debut in February 2018 and has rattled off four wins, including a sensational first-round knockout of Brunson at UFC 230 in November. On his part, Silva, 43, hasn’t fought since a decision win against Derek Brunson in February 2017. He failed a random drug test in October 2017. However, the United States Anti-Doping Agency ultimately ruled the positive test was caused by a contaminated dietary supplement, and Silva agreed to a one-year suspension. Long considered the greatest fighter of all time, Silva (34-8) has just one win in the past five years. The Brazilian held the record for most consecutive UFC title defenses for years, until flyweight Demetrious Johnson broke the mark in October 2017.
