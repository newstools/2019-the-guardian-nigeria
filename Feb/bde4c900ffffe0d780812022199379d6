Kanu – an activist who divides his time between the UK and Nigeria, spreading his ethos on social media and Radio Biafra – was arrested on charges of criminal conspiracy and belonging to an illegal society.

Kanu had told members of the group to sit home on the election day as a form referendum to determine their continued allegiance to Nigeria. The group, seeking an independent state of Biafra, said the boycott will serve as a form of a referendum of the predominantly Igbo people of the South-east’s wish to secede from Nigeria. “IPOB will liberate Biafra and we will not take part in any election until we get a referendum, and this is not negotiable, we will achieve this by every necessary means,” Kanu said in a broadcast. The referendum is to “ascertain number of those who want Nigeria politics and those who want Biafra freedom through a peaceful and democratic process for the sovereignty of our dear nation Biafra,” IPOB spokesman, Comrade Emma Powerful said in a statement. The IPOB leader is facing charges of treasonable felony at the Federal High Court in Abuja.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
