The first spin for the new Fast and Furious has been released. This time, the film is titled Hobbs and Shaw (Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham). Both characters must team up to defeat their common enemy, a bullet-proof Brixton (Idris Elba.) The idea of this film came about after both characters were put in prison, the writer and creator of the new spin-off, Chris Morgan told the BBC News. “It wasn’t until [The Fate of the Furious], where we put them together in a prison, that we saw how well Jason and Dwayne bounced off each other,” “And really, we have so many takes of the things they would say to each other off the cuff that were so funny, [the chemistry] was kind of undeniable.” “We’ve always wanted to expand the Fast universe, there’s definitely more stories to be told there, stories that happened to these characters in between the major tent-pole adventures, and it just seems like Dwayne and Jason was the clear way to do it.” Speaking on the Brixton’s suit, he said: “The suit Brixton’s wearing is bullet-proof, he is a slightly future-tech mercenary, a kind of augmented soldier,” “And it was important for us, especially for this first outing for Hobbs and Shaw, to put them up against someone who is a real true challenge to them… so bad, so tough, so capable, that it would force them to team up.”  The film is out in cinemas August 2.
