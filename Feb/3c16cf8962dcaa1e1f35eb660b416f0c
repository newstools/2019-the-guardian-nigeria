Veteran Nigerian comedian has taken to Instagram to share marriage advice to bachelors out there. In a video shared on his Instagram page, the ace comedian who has been married for 17 years tells men who are intending to get married to believe in the equal rights of men and women as well as the type of woman to marry. He said ”If you do not believe that a man and a woman have equal rights, don’t bother about marriage. If you are looking for a woman to worship and serve you, do not marry an educated woman. If you are insecured and too jealous, don’t marry a woman who is beautiful. But if you are looking for a woman who would give and raise beautiful children with you, take you to the next level, support you in times of need, marry a beautiful woman who is hardworking and educated and has a mind of her own. Don’t carry somebody’s daughter to punish her” he said Watch the clip below:   Small expo to bachelors who are planning to marry. #realitycheck A post shared by  Okey Onyegbule (@okeybakassi) on Feb 4, 2019 at 8:54am PST
