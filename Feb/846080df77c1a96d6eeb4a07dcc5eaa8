In a statement, La Liga said Bale was accused of “raising his right arm towards his head, a gesture of provocation towards the supporters, and then making a possibly obscene and derogatory gesture by raising his bent arm and hitting it halfway up with the other hand.” The attempted gesture, known literally as a “sleeve-cutter”, is seen as highly offensive in Spain. If the Welshman is found guilty of inciting rival fans, according to Spanish Football Federation rules he risks a ban of anything from four to 12 games, although a shorter suspension of one to three matches is more likely. Real play Girona and Levante in their next two La Liga games before a double-header against Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabeu. The teams meet first in the Copa del Rey semi-final second leg on February 27 and then clash again in the league on March 2.
