Hollywood actor and producer, Tyler Perry has shared his two cents on the scandal currently rocking “Empire” star, Jussie Smollett. Smollet we reported earlier was arrested for staging an attack on himself and filing a false police report. Reacting to the scandal that has been trending, Perry took to Instagram to say he has spoken with Smollett and that the “Empire” star insists he is telling the truth about being attacked. Sharing a photo collage of Smollet and two missing men (Terrance Williams and Felipe Santos) on Instagram, Perry wrote, “How I wish that the disappearance of Terrance Williams and Felipe Santos could get half as much attention as this Jussie Smollett thing. I have personally spoken to Jussie, and he is adamant that he’s telling the truth. Also, everyone that I know who knows him says that he is not the kind of person who would make up such a horrible and awful thing. Yet the evidence seems to state otherwise. I’m lost for words. To stoke fears and raise racial tensions is wrong in every situation on ALL SIDES! Yet my prayers are still with him and his family and our Nation. CAN WE PLEASE STOP THE HATE!” We reported earlier that Smollett has issued an apology to members of the set of “Empire” shortly after his release and also insisted to them that he is innocent of the allegations as he didn’t stage the homophobic and racist attack on himself.
