The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, (EFCC), Ibadan Zonal Office has arrested one Kola Al-Amin, a former staff of the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board, JAMB, over alleged forgery and obtaining money by false pretences. EFCC, in a statement signed by its acting Spokesperson, Tony Orilade, disclosed that his (Al-Amin) arrest followed a petition alleging that sometime in November, 2010, Kola, who operates under the name of “Cool Technologies Consult Limited”with office located at No.4/900, Taiwo House, Second Floor, Yemetu Total Garden, Ibadan, Oyo State, approached the complainant, a microfinance bank (name withheld) with a Local Purchasing Order (LPO) for the supply of internet hardware which he claimed was from JAMB headquarters, Abuja. Orilade said that Al-Amin requested the microfinance bank to advance him a loan of 10,000,000.00 (Ten Million Naira) only to finance the LPO. The petitioner, according to the Orilade, further alleged that Kola was granted the loan with the agreement that the proceeding of the LPO from JAMB will be paid directly into his account with the microfinance bank but that at maturity time for repayment, he allegedly disappeared. On verification of the LPO in JAMB headquarters, Abuja, it was discovered that the LPO provided by the suspect was forged and that he was no longer a staff of the organization. Additional investigation revealed that the suspect has been involved in several other fraudulent deals under the same guise of being a JAMB official, Orilade added. Orilade said further that he will be charged to court upon conclusion of investigations. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
