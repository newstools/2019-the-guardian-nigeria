It appears Mexican druglord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán has become the newest unlikely fashion influencer. Alejandrina Gisselle Guzmán, one of El Chapo’s 10 known children, has spent the last several weeks promoting her brand called El Chapo 701, a reference to El Chapo’s ranking on Forbes’ 2009 list of the world’s billionaires. the drug lord’s designer daughter is attempting to profit off her father’s name with an El Chapo-inspired clothing brand. It is in fact a very well timed project, as the kingpin is in the midst of a highly priority trial for drug trafficking, money laundering, and murder. Alejandrina has also launched the brand’s official website, which features photos of the forthcoming designs. There’s apparel pieces like T-shirts, blazers, coats, and button-ups, as well as accessories like hats, leather belts, and iPhone cases.
