 Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu. Photo/Twitter/GOVONDO  INEC postponed the 2019 Presidential and National Assembly elections scheduled for Feb.16, till Feb. 23. INEC announced the postponement after a careful review of the implementation of its logistics and operational plan and the determination to conduct free, fair and credible elections. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Governorship and State House of Assembly elections scheduled for March 2 were also shifted to March 9. Speaking with newsmen in Owo, Ondo State on Saturday, Akeredolu explained that the election was a national one which could not be staggered but had to hold all over the country in one day. According to him, INEC must have had several hours of meetings and deliberations with good reasons for the postponement. “When we reached out to them, we were told they had logistics problems. They were probably unable to get materials to their destinations. “I tried to call a few people who should know and up till 12 midnight they still gave assurance that the Nigerian Airforce were moving materials to their destinations. “I am sure they found out it was impossible to get the materials to their destinations and they had to postpone the elections.“The only thing anybody will worry about is why this late and why had they not taken enough steps. “Let’s be fair to ourselves and INEC, they had problems. Some offices burnt and a number of things happened; so all we have to do is wait for a week, ’’ Akeredolu said. The governor urged Ondo State indigenes and others to be calm and bear the inconveniences for a week.“A week is not so far. We can say this Saturday is wasted but we will have a weekend of rest,’’ he said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
