 U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria, Stuart Syminton PHOTO:Youtube  Syminton stated this when he visited the Inspector-General of Police, Mr Mohammed Adamu, in Abuja. He said that the U.S. was aware of the security challenges confronting Nigeria and the efforts of the Police to tackle them. The envoy, however, said he was optimistic that the right things were being done to ensure that peace and security reigned in the country. “I am here to give my support to the Nigeria Police Force,” he said. Responding, the I-G said that the Police, under his watch, was tackling the security challenges in parts of the country. He, however, pointed out that the challenges could not be tackled without the support of citizens. “We are also seeking the support of the diplomatic community. We need your support in the area of training for our personnel which you have done several times,“ he said. Adamu called for further assistance from the US in the area of technology to further enhance the operational capacity of the force. The U.S. and the United Kingdom recently announced repercussions, including visa restrictions, for election interference and election-related violence in the forthcoming polls in Nigeria.
