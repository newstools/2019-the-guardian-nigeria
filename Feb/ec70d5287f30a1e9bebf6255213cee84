Awwal Garba Deputy Chairman, All Progressives Congress’s (APC) Progressives Network, Awwal Garba, has urged politicians to desist from monetary inducement, saying this would enable them serve the people as they ought. He made the statement yesterday, saying it was time Nigerians voted the candidates of their choice without any form of intimidation, as it would aid the development of the country. Garba also expressed optimism that if President Muhammadu Buhari was elected for a second term, the country would be better for it, saying he has a record of curbing corruption. He said: “We should stop the politics of money and vote-buying. We should allow Nigerians to vote for candidates of their choice without influencing them. It is a disgrace to buy one’s way into public office. When that happens, you look at yourself as a businessman and begin to fashion out ways to recoup spent money. This is what has been happening for ages. Only a person voted in by merit would think of improving the lives of the people. “President Buhari deserves a second term, because we need a leader who is clean. When a head is clean, the middle and bottom will also be, because they would be put in a position where they are wary. But if the top is rotten, then it is corruption galore. We need a leader like Buhari whom money does not mean anything to. A president who is so humble he can even stand with cows. He is simple, not extravagant; these are qualities he has officially demonstrated which can be widely attested to. I believe that with him coming back, God sparing his life, he will achieve a lot.” Garba added that the group is also saddled with the responsibility of making sure that the forthcoming elections are free and fair.
