A Federal High court in Lagos has ordered the arrest of the former director general of the National Intelligence Agency, Ayodele Oke, and his wife, Folashade Oke. “I have carefully considered the oral application for the arrest of the person mentioned herein and I am convinced beyond reasonable doubt that the said application is meritorious,” the presiding judge Chukwujekwu Aneke said in court on Thursday. “Accordingly the application is hereby granted as prayed. It is hereby ordered that Ambassador Ayodele Oke and wife, Folasade Oke be arrested anywhere they have been sighted in the world,” he added. Oke and his wife were charged in connection with the $43,449,947,000 found in Flat 7B, No. 16 Osborne Road, Osborne Towers, Ikoyi, Lagos in April 2017. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had filed a four-count charge against them in connection with the money discovered. The four-count charge against the couple was signed by Oyedepo, Nnaemeka Omewa and Idris Abubakar Mohammed. EFCC in the Proof of Evidence revealed how Flat 7B was bought for $1, 658,000 (N596, 880,000). The anti-graft agency said one Alhaji Shehu Usman Anka has evidence of the receipt of the sum of $1, 658,000 from the wife of the ex-NIA boss. EFCC also alleged that NIA got about $289,202,382.00 from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
