United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) in partnership with Civil Societies and Cross River State government have taken 53 marginalised children off the streets of Calabar, with plans to unite them with their families and foster parents. The children who are between 5 to 17 years are presently having 21 days rehabilitation camp in Calabar. UNICEF Child Protection Specialist, Enugu Field Office, Mrs. Nkiru Maduechesi, who spoke during the official launching of the Children’s fun camping at the weekend said about 424 marginalised kids were found, but only 53 of them could easily be reintegrated.While cautioning people from tagging them as ‘Street Children’, Maduechesi said, “calling them street children is not good; we don’t want it to reflect anywhere, its marginalize children, they are supposed to be in a family setting but they are not, they are vulnerable.” She said some of the children who are gifted in dancing and singing would be linked up with professionals or international artists who are passionate in doing humanitarian work.UNICEF Chief field officer, Enugu, Ibrahim Conteh said government should protect the rights of children noting that government has the responsibility to ensure that these children are not left behind.
