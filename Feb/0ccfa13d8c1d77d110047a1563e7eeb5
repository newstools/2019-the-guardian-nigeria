Kim Kardashian West has slammed ‘Bachelor’ creator Mike Fleiss for claiming he’s in talks to make Khloe the next ‘Bachelorette’ – sharing texts showing he’s not joking. Kim responded on Twitter Saturday, in response to Fleiss’ earlier tweet that he’d been in contact with his “dear friend” Kris Jenner about Khloe being “The Bachelorette” next season by calling it “Fake f***ing news big time!!!!” Fleiss replied saying Kim wouldn’t know. So she replied with a screenshot of a text between her mom and her sister denying his claims. ….. @fleissmeister pic.twitter.com/zftf83KYWu — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) February 24, 2019  Khloe also went after Mike she seemed angry with the claims, tweeting, “I’m not f***ing clickbait right now. Stop or you will be hearing from my lawyers. How insensitive!!” Fleiss responded by saying he’s just trying to help people find true love. This comes after reports came in that Tristan Thompson allegedly cheated on Khloe again; this time with Kylie’s BFF Jordyn Woods. “The Bachelor” creator’s clearly looking to capitalise on that, but the Kardashians would not have any of it.
