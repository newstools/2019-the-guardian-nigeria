National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) has revealed that the patronage of local Information Technology equipment have continued to grow by about 100% in the last three years. Dr. Isa Ibrahim Pantami, director-general of NITDA, said this while unveiling five new guidelines to further strengthen the country’s IT sector in Abuja.The DG said that the public presentation of the guidelines was necessary following the agency’s mandate to develop the IT sector and ensure promotion of locally made products. According to him, Indigenous Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) sold 98,224 devices in 2015, 154,424 in 2016 and 355,647 in 2017.‘‘This is unprecedented in the history of the country and this is expected to continue to grow significantly in the coming years.‘‘On assumption of office, we realized that the agency did not have any instrument that stipulates a clear process for rule making for issuance of frameworks, standards and guidelines. ‘‘This effort is to ensure that a defined, best practice approach to rule making is utilized by NITDA to develop sound instruments for regulation of IT.‘‘We also anticipate that the public will now understand all the processes involved in issuance of regulatory documents by the agency. This policy also creates platforms for public engagement in the issuance of regulatory documents by the agency. ‘‘From this point henceforth, NITDA will be generally bound by the rulemaking process as an integral part of the operations of the agency. ‘‘These efforts resulted in an exceptional increase in the patronage of locally assembled devices. “Records have shown that in 2015, Indigenous Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) sold 98,224 devices in 2015, 154,424 in 2016 and 355,647 in 2017,’’ he said.
