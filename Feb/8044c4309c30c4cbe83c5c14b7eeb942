“Megbele” crooner, Omawumi in a recent interview has revealed who she would have voted for in the forthcoming presidential election. The songstress disclosed that former presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Obiageli Ezekwesili would have been her choice if she did not pull out of the race weeks ago. She said, “She (Ezekwesili) was a former minister, she has always been involved and she always speaks out when things go wrong. She was the major propaganda of the ‘Bring back our girls’ campaign; so it’s not because she is a woman. It’s because I feel that of all of them contesting for the presidency, she is the best person for the job. But that’s my opinion, everybody is entitled to one.” The “If You Ask Me” hitmaker further went on to say that Ezekwesili proved her qualification for the job at the presidential debate where she stated her plans for the country. Speaking on women participation in politics, Omawumi said, “I think that as women, with active participation and inspiring other young women we can contribute to the growth of the nation. That is exactly what is happening now; when women sit down together, what they talk about is no longer domestic issues. What we talk about is why politicians think they can misbehave and not be held accountable. When women are being more interested in what is going on and then we can continue to spread the conversation. The more it spreads the more women we will find to be interested in knowing and being a part of the movement. It’s not always easy but we will get there”. It would be recalled that just recently, Omawumi threw a major jab at two major 2019 presidential aspirants during a live performance. The award-winning singer who refrained from mentioning specific names in her public call out described one of them an incompetent old man and the other as someone that is “somewhat corrupt.”
