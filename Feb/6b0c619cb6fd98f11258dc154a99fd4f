The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Ambrose Alli University (AAU) chapter has constituted a five-man committee to interface with the university management over the alleged sexual harassment levied against its chairman, Dr. Monday Igbafen. Authorities of the university had suspended Igbafen for alleged sexual harassment. They explained that the suspension followed the arraignment of Igbafen before the senior staff disciplinary committee on allegations of gross misconduct bothering on sexual harassment and threat of sex for marks. ASUU in a communique by its embattled chairman and secretary, Dr. Anthony Aizebioje-Coker declared members’ unalloyed support for Igbafen and passed a vote of confidence on him. The congress said the suspension was a fallout of the union’s insistence on its principles and due process as well as its resolve to successfully partake in the just suspended nationwide strike by university teachers. The union described Igbafen’s suspension as an aberration and an act of vendetta. While the branch declared its total support for the chairperson of the union, it also vowed to continue to insist on due process, integrity and transparency in running the affairs of the university.
