When Guardian Life interviewed the cast of “Up North”, little did we know that we were in for a delightful tale of drama. From the shooting to the choosing of the cast to the choice of the producer and director, the film overcame its hurdles to become one of Nigerian’s recently celebrated films and if we add the capture of the Durbar festival, then that is another tale. “UpNorth” touches on several subjects and excellently showcases the lives of the Hausas in a way that stirs the desires of the audience to visit the Northern part of Nigeria. The Tope Oshin-directed film has clinched a notable achievement at Facebook where it will be screened at its Headquarters in Carlifornia in celebration of black history month. This will take place on the 20th of February at Facebook Menlo Park Campus. Producer Editi Effiong through Zulumoke, co-founder inkblot productions announced this via his social media handle, “We are very excited, this is a huge step for us and what better way to screen a movie that promotes culture and black excellence than the month that celebrates black history. We are happy and confident everyone who sees this movie will enjoy it as much as we did. ‘This is such an amazing moment for us, we are elated to know that many other people will be a part of the culture we are trying to showcase to the world through ‘Up North’. We cannot wait for everyone who sees this movie to enjoy the magic and experience its greatness. We also cannot wait to get feedback’” Up North features some of Nigeria’s very best and gathers creatives in different industries to give a stellar performance. Some of the acts are; Banky W, Ibrahim Suleiman, Michelle Dede, Kanayo.O Kanayo, Rahama Sadau, Hilda Dokubo, Adesua Etomi Wellington, and BBNaija’s Tboss.
